       " 'Early life \\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Christopher Edward Nolan was born on 30 July 1970, in Westminster, London. His father, Brendan James Nolan, was a British advertising executive of Irish descent who worked as a creative director. His mother, Christina Jensen, was an American flight attendant from Evanston, Illinois; she would later work as a teacher of English. He has an elder brother, Matthew, and a younger brother, Jonathan, also a filmmaker. The three brothers were raised Catholic in Highgate and would spend their summers in Evanston. Nolan holds both UK and US citizenship.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Growing up, Nolan was particularly influenced by the work of Sir Ridley Scott and the science fiction films 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Star Wars (1977). He would repeatedly watch the latter film and extensively research its making. Nolan began making films at the age of seven, borrowing his father\\'s Super 8 camera and shooting short films with his action figures. These films included a stop motion animation homage to Star Wars called Space Wars. He cast his brother Jonathan and built sets from \"clay, flour, egg boxes and toilet rolls\". His uncle, who had worked at NASA building guidance systems for the Apollo rockets, sent him some launch footage: \"I re-filmed them off the screen and cut them in, thinking no-one would notice\", Nolan later remarked. From the age of 11, he aspired to be a professional filmmaker. Between 1981 and 1983, Nolan enrolled at Barrow Hills, a Catholic prep school in Witley, Surrey. In his teenage years, Nolan started making films with Adrien and Roko Belic. Nolan and Roko co-directed the surreal 8 mm Tarantella (1989), which was shown on Image Union, an independent film and video showcase on the Public Broadcasting Service. After a fan posted a copy of Tarantella online, in 2021, Nolan\\'s production company filed a copyright infringement claim, to have the film removed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Nolan was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, an independent school in Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire, and later studied English literature at University College London (UCL). Opting out of a traditional film education, he pursued \"a degree in something unrelated\", which his father suggested \"gives a different take on things\". He chose UCL specifically for its filmmaking facilities, which comprised a Steenbeck editing suite and 16 mm film cameras. Nolan was president of the Union\\'s Film Society, and with Emma Thomas (his girlfriend and future wife) he screened feature films in 35mm during the school year and used the money earned to produce 16 mm films over the summers.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Personal life and public image \\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Nolan is married to Emma Thomas, whom he met at University College London when he was 19. She has worked as a producer on all of his films since 1997. The couple have four children and reside in Los Angeles.\\n',\n",
       " 'Nolan prefers to maintain a certain level of mystery about his work. Refusing to discuss his personal life, he feels that too much biographical information about a filmmaker detracts from the experience of his audiences. \"I actually don\\'t want people to have me in mind at all when they\\'re watching the films.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Filmmaking style \\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Nolan\\'s films are largely centred in metaphysical themes, exploring the concepts of time, memory and personal identity. His work is characterised by mathematically inspired ideas and images, unconventional narrative structures, materialistic perspectives, and evocative use of music and sound. Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro called Nolan \"an emotional mathematician\". BBC\\'s arts editor Will Gompertz described him as \"an art house auteur making intellectually ambitious blockbuster movies that can leave your pulse racing and your head spinning\". Joseph Bevan wrote, \"His films allow arthouse regulars to enjoy superhero flicks and multiplex crowds to engage with labyrinthine plot conceits.\" Nolan views himself as \"an indie filmmaker working inside the studio system\".\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'In the sixteen-essay book The Philosophy of Christopher Nolan, professional philosophers and writers analysed Nolan\\'s work; they identified themes of self-destruction, the nature and value of the truth, and the political mindset of the hero and villain, among others. Robbie B. H. Goh, a professor of English literature, described Nolan as a \"philosophical filmmaker\" who includes philosophical ideas—existentialism, morality, epistemology and the distinction between appearance and reality—in films that frequently portray suspense, action and violence. Goh appreciated his ability to incorporate such themes in films that possess \"elements of the Hollywood blockbuster\"—which help keep the audiences engaged—but simultaneously remain \"more thoughtful and self-reflexive than the typical consumerist action film\". He further wrote that Nolan\\'s body of work reflect \"a heterogeneity of conditions of products\" extending from low-budget films to lucrative blockbusters, \"a wide range of genres and settings\" and \"a diversity of styles that trumpet his versatility\".\\n',\n",
       " 'David Bordwell, a film theorist, wrote that Nolan has been able to blend his \"experimental impulses\" with the demands of mainstream entertainment, describing his oeuvre as \"experiments with cinematic time by means of techniques of subjective viewpoint and crosscutting\". Nolan\\'s use of practical, in-camera effects, miniatures and models, as well as shooting on celluloid film, has been highly influential in early 21st century cinema. IndieWire wrote in 2019 that, Nolan \"kept a viable alternate model of big-budget filmmaking alive\", in an era where blockbuster filmmaking has become \"a largely computer-generated art form\". Because of Nolan\\'s deep involvement in the technical facet of his films, Stuart Joy described him as a \"complete filmmaker\", who \"oversees all aspects of production while also managing cultural and industrial factors outside of the text\".\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Recognition \\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Nolan has made some of the most influential and popular films of his time. Many of his films have been regarded by critics as among the best of their respective decades, and according to The Wall Street Journal, his \"ability to combine box-office success with artistic ambition has given him an extraordinary amount of clout in the industry\". His films have earned more than $6 billion. Nolan\\'s films Memento and The Dark Knight have been selected by the US Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant. These films and Inception appeared in BBC\\'s 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century and The Hollywood Reporter\\'s poll of best films ever made. In 2017, The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar featured in Empire magazine\\'s poll of \"The 100 Greatest Movies\". In 2018, The Hollywood Reporter listed Nolan as one of the 100 most powerful people in entertainment and described him as a \"franchise unto himself\". Parade ranked Nolan number eight in its 2022 list of 75 Best Movie Directors of All Time.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Nolan\\'s work has been as \"intensely embraced, analysed and debated by ordinary film fans as by critics and film academics\". Calling him \"a persuasively inventive storyteller\", Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute named Nolan one of the few contemporary filmmakers producing highly personal films within the Hollywood mainstream. Andrew wrote that Nolan\\'s films are \"not so much [notable] for their considerable technical virtuosity and visual flair as for their brilliant narrative ingenuity and their unusually adult interest in complex philosophical questions\". David Bordwell observed that Nolan is \"considered one of the most accomplished living filmmakers\", citing his ability to turn genre movies into both art and event films, as well as his box office numbers, critical acclaim and popularity among cinemagoers. In 2008, Philip French deemed Nolan \"the first major talent to emerge this century\". Mark Kermode complimented Nolan for bringing \"the discipline and ethics of art-house independent moviemaking and apply[ing] them to Hollywood blockbusters. He\\'s living proof that you don\\'t have to appeal to the lowest common denominator to be profitable\". The Observer\\'s Ryan Gilbey described Nolan as a \"skillful, stylish storyteller, capable of combining the spectacle of Spielberg with the intellectual intricacy of Nicolas Roeg or Alain Resnais\". Mark Cousins applauded Nolan for embracing big ideas, \"Hollywood filmmakers generally shy away from ideas—but not Christopher Nolan\". Scott Foundas of Variety declared Nolan \"the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation\", and Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times called him \"the great proceduralist of 21st century blockbuster filmmaking, a lover of nuts-and-bolts minutiae\".\\n',\n",
       " 'Nolan has been praised by many of his contemporaries, and his work has influenced them. Kenneth Branagh called Nolan\\'s approach to large-scale filmmaking \"unique in modern cinema\", adding, \"regardless of how popular his movies become, he remains an artist and an auteur. I think for that reason he has become a heroic figure for both the audience and the people working behind the camera.\" Michael Mann complimented Nolan for his \"singular vision\" and credited with \"invent[ing] the post-heroic superhero\". Nicolas Roeg said of Nolan, \"People talk about \\'commercial art\\' and the term is usually self-negating; Nolan works in the commercial arena and yet there\\'s something very poetic about his work.\" Martin Scorsese identified Nolan as a filmmaker creating \"beautifully made films on a big scale\".\\n',\n",
       " 'Damien Chazelle lauded Nolan for his ability \"to make the most seemingly impersonal projects—superhero epics, deep-space mind-benders—feel deeply personal\". Discussing the difference between art films and big studio blockbusters, Steven Spielberg referred to Nolan\\'s Dark Knight series as an example of both; he has described Memento and Inception as \"masterworks\". Denis Villeneuve was impressed by Nolan\\'s ability \"to keep his identity and create his own universe in that large scope ... To bring intellectual concepts and to bring them in that scope to the screen right now—it\\'s very rare. Every movie that he comes out with, I have more admiration for his work.\" James Cameron expressed disappointment that Nolan was not nominated for an Academy Award as Best Director for Inception, calling it \"the most astounding piece of film creation and direction of the year, hands down\".\\n',\n",

       " 'Nolan has been nominated for eight Academy Awards (winning two), eight British Academy Film Awards (winning two) and six Golden Globe Awards (winning one). Nolan was named an Honorary Fellow of UCL in 2006, and conferred an honorary doctorate in literature in 2017. From 2011 to 2014, he appeared in Forbes Celebrity 100 list based on his income and popularity. In 2012, he became the youngest director to receive a hand-and-footprint ceremony at Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles. Nolan appeared in Time\\'s 100 most influential people in the world in 2015. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to film. In 2023, he was awarded the Federation of American Scientists\\' Public Service Award for his depiction of scientists in his film Oppenheimer. In 2024, Nolan received the British Film Institute Fellowship in recognition of his \"extraordinary achievements and enormous contribution to cinema,\" and the Honorary César award from the Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma for \"continually push[ing] the boundaries of storytelling.\" In March 2024, Nolan was made a knight bachelor for his contributions to film, while his wife Emma Thomas was honoured with a damehood.\\n',\n",

       " 'Nolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After studying English literature at University College London, he made several short films before his feature film debut with Following (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, Memento (2000), and transitioned into studio filmmaking with Insomnia (2002). He became a high-profile director with The Dark Knight trilogy (2005–2012), and found further success with The Prestige (2006), Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk (2017). After the release of Tenet (2020), Nolan parted ways with longtime distributor Warner Bros.

       " 'A struggling, unemployed young writer (credited as \"The Young Man\") takes to following strangers around the streets of London, ostensibly to find inspiration for his first novel. Initially, he sets strict rules for himself regarding whom he should follow and for how long, but he soon discards them as he focuses on a well-groomed, handsome man in a dark suit. The man in the suit, having noticed he is being followed, quickly confronts the Young Man and introduces himself as \"Cobb\". Cobb reveals he is a serial burglar and invites the Young Man (who tells Cobb his name is \"Bill\") to accompany him on burglaries. The material gains from these crimes seem to be of secondary importance to Cobb. He takes pleasure in rifling through the personal items in his targets\\' flats and drinking their wine. He explains his true passion is using the shock of robbery, and violation of property, to make his victims re-examine their lives. He sums up his attitude thus: \"You take it away, and show them what they had.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'The Young Man is thrilled by Cobb\\'s lifestyle. He attempts break-ins of his own, as Cobb encourages and guides him. At Cobb\\'s suggestion, he alters his appearance, cutting his hair short and wearing a dark suit. He assumes the name \"Daniel Lloyd\", based on the credit card Cobb gives to him, and begins to pursue a relationship with a blonde woman whose flat he and Cobb burgled. The Blonde turns out to be the girlfriend of a small-time gangster (known only as the \"Bald Guy\"), whom she broke up with after he murdered a man in her flat. Soon, the Blonde confides that the Bald Guy is blackmailing her with incriminating photographs. The Young Man breaks into the Bald Guy\\'s safe, but is caught in the act by an unidentified man. He then bludgeons the man with a claw hammer and flees with the Bald Guy\\'s money and photos. Upon returning to his flat, he finds the photos are innocuous modeling shots.\\n',\n",
       " \"Confronting the Blonde, the Young Man learns that she and Cobb have been working together, to manipulate him into mimicking Cobb's burglary methods. She tells him that Cobb had recently discovered a murdered woman's body during one of his burglaries, and is attempting to deflect suspicion from himself by making it appear as though multiple burglars share his MO.\\n\",\n",
       " \"The Young Man leaves to turn himself in to the police. The Blonde reports her success to Cobb, who then reveals he actually works for the Bald Guy. The story about the murdered woman was part of a plot to deceive both the Blonde and the Young Man: The Blonde has been blackmailing the Bald Guy with evidence from the murder he committed in her flat, and he wants her murdered in a way that cannot be connected to him. Cobb bludgeons the Blonde to death with the same claw hammer the Young Man used during the burglary of the Bald Guy's safe and leaves it at the scene. The police, checking out the Young Man's story, find the Blonde murdered and the claw hammer with his fingerprints on it. The Young Man is thus implicated for the murder of the Blonde.

Nolan used a non-linear plot structure for the film, a device he again used in Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige, Dunkirk, and Oppenheimer. This type of storytelling, he says, reflected the audience's inherent uncertainty about characters in film noir:\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " \"In a compelling story of this genre we are continually being asked to rethink our assessment of the relationship between the various characters, and I decided to structure my story in such a way as to emphasize the audience's incomplete understanding of each new scene as it is first presented.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Following was written and planned to be as inexpensive to produce as possible, but Nolan has described the production of the film as \"extreme\", even for a low-budget shoot. With little money, limited equipment, and a cast and crew who were all in full-time employment on weekdays, the production took a full year to complete.\\n',\n",
       " 'To conserve expensive film stock, every scene in the film was rehearsed extensively to ensure that the first or second take could be used in the final edit. Filming took place on Saturdays for 3-4 months; Nolan shot about fifteen minutes of footage each day. This time frame also moderated the cost of film stock and allowed him to pay for it out of his salary. For the most part, Nolan filmed without professional film lighting equipment, largely employing available light. This was made easier by the decision to use 16 mm black and white film, since that eliminated the need to match light colour. He also used the homes of his friends and family as locations.\\n',\n",

All these findings taken together suggest a deregulation of the arousal system, cognitive system, and HPA axis all contributing to insomnia. However, it is unknown if the hyperarousal is a result of, or cause of insomnia. Altered levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA have been found, but the results have been inconsistent, and the implications of altered levels of such a ubiquitous neurotransmitter are unknown. Studies on whether insomnia is driven by circadian control over sleep or a wake dependent process have shown inconsistent results, but some literature suggests a deregulation of the circadian rhythm based on core temperature.

Past medical history and a physical examination need to be done to eliminate other conditions that could be the cause of insomnia. After all other conditions are ruled out a comprehensive sleep history should be taken. The sleep history should include sleep habits, medications (prescription and non-prescription), alcohol consumption, nicotine and caffeine intake, co-morbid illnesses, and sleep environment. A sleep diary can be used to keep track of the individual's sleep patterns. The diary should include time to bed, total sleep time, time to sleep onset, number of awakenings, use of medications, time of awakening, and subjective feelings in the morning. The sleep diary can be replaced or validated by the use of out-patient actigraphy for a week or more, using a non-invasive device that measures movement.\\n\",\n",

This test may be indicated for patients with symptoms in addition to insomnia, including sleep apnea, obesity, a thick neck diameter, or high-risk fullness of the flesh in the oropharynx.

Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. It may result in an increased risk of accidents of all kinds as well as problems focusing and learning. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month. The concept of the word insomnia has two possibilities: insomnia disorder (ID) and insomnia symptoms, and many abstracts of randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews often underreport on which of these two possibilities the word insomnia refers to.\\n',\n",

Conditions that can result in insomnia include ADHD, psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, restless leg syndrome, menopause, certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Other risk factors include working night shifts and sleep apnea. Diagnosis is based on sleep habits and an examination to look for underlying causes. A sleep study may be done to look for underlying sleep disorders. Screening may be done with two questions: \"do you experience difficulty sleeping?\" and \"do you have difficulty falling or staying asleep?\"\\n',\n",

Sleep hygiene includes a consistent bedtime, a quiet and dark room, exposure to sunlight during the day and regular exercise. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be added to this. While sleeping pills may help, they are sometimes associated with injuries, dementia, and addiction. These medications are not recommended for more than four or five weeks.

Josh Hartnett met with Nolan about the role, but decided against pursuing it. Bale, Bailey and Murphy auditioned using the Batman Forever sonar suit donated by Val Kilmer, but the cape was lost, and Amy Adams served as the casting reader for the casting of Bruce Wayne / Batman in a favor to the casting director. Bale felt the previous films underused Batman\\'s character, overplaying the villains instead. To best pose as Batman, Bale studied graphic novels and illustrations of the superhero. Director Nolan said of Bale, \"He has exactly the balance of darkness and light that we were looking for.\" Goyer stated that while some actors could play a great Bruce Wayne or a great Batman, Bale could portray both radically different personalities. Since he had lost a great deal of weight in preparation for his role in The Machinist, Bale hired a personal trainer to help him gain 100 pounds (45 kg) of muscle in the span of only a couple of months to help him physically prepare for the role. After realizing he went over by 30 pounds (14 kg), he lost the excess weight by the time filming began. Bale trained in Wing Chun Kung Fu under Eric Oram in preparation for the movie.\\n',\n",

Director Christopher Nolan stated that the idea behind the film was \"a person who would confront his innermost fear and then attempt to become it\". Fingeroth referred to this film\\'s depiction as \"the man with fear—but who rises above it\". The theme of fear is further personified by the Scarecrow. The film depicts how fear can affect all creatures regardless of might. Allusions to fear are seen throughout, from Bruce\\'s conquering of his demons, to becoming Batman, to the Scarecrow and his deadly fear toxin.

The theme of fear is intensified with the help of the musical score by Zimmer and Howard, which also \"eschews traditional heroic themes\". Also contrary to previous Batman films, a psychological investigation of Bruce Wayne\\'s split personality in the bat suit is only lightly touched upon.

After the studio rejected a Batman origin story reboot Joss Whedon pitched in December 2002, Warner Bros. hired Nolan in January 2003 to direct a new film. Nolan and Goyer began development on the film in early 2003. Aiming for a darker, more realistic tone compared to the previous films, a primary goal for their vision was to engage the audience's emotional investment in both the Batman and Bruce Wayne identities of the lead character. The film, which was principally shot in the United Kingdom, Iceland and Chicago, relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects, with computer-generated imagery being used in a minimal capacity compared to other action films.

The reader learns that Alfred Borden is actually not one man but two: identical twins named Albert and Frederick who share the identity of \"Alfred Borden\" secretly to ensure their professional success with \"The New Transported Man\". Angier suspects that Borden uses a double, but dismisses the idea because he thinks it is too easy.\\n',\n",
       " 'In the meantime, Angier had developed his own act and left his wife for his stage assistant, Olivia. Desperate to discover how Borden\\'s trick is performed, Angier sends Olivia to spy on Borden. However, Olivia begins to fall in love with Borden, and they conspire to send Angier on a wild goose chase thinking that the act relies on technology from the acclaimed inventor Nikola Tesla. After being contacted by Angier, Tesla eventually constructs a machine which Angier uses to develop an act called \"In a Flash\". Tesla\\'s device teleports a human being from one place to another by creating an exact physical duplicate at a specified destination into which the person\\'s consciousness is instantly transmitted while the original body is left behind, lifeless. Because of this method, Angier is forced to devise a way to conceal the original bodies whenever the trick is performed. He clinically refers to these near-lifeless shells in his diary as \"the prestiges\".\\n',\n",
       " 'Angier\\'s new act is as successful as Borden\\'s. The infuriated and obsessed Borden attempts to discover how \"In a Flash\" is performed. During one performance he breaks into the backstage area and turns off the power to Angier\\'s device, mistakenly believing the generator powering it is about to catch fire and light the theatre ablaze. The subsequent teleportation is incomplete and both the duplicated Angier and the \"prestige\" Angier survive as separate persons after this incident, though the duplicate seems to lack physical substance while the original feels increasingly weak physically. The original \"prestige\" Angier fakes his own death as part of a previous plan to put behind his public persona of a magician, and returns as the heir to his family estate of Caldlow House without any publicity. While there, he becomes terminally ill.\\n',\n",
       " 'Angier had discovered Borden\\'s secret as a twin prior to the accident that created his duplicate. Angier\\'s duplicate, feeling alienated from the world by his ghostly form and consumed with thoughts of revenge, attacks one of the Borden twins before a performance. However, Borden\\'s apparent poor health, age, and the duplicate Angier\\'s resurgent sense of morality cause him to stop short of murdering the twin. It is implied that this particular Borden twin dies a few days later, and the incorporeal Angier travels to meet the original \"prestige\" Angier, now living as the 14th Earl of Colderdale. They come into possession of Borden\\'s diary, courtesy of a disgruntled third party in need of money, but publish it without revealing the twins\\' secret. Shortly afterwards, the corporeal Angier dies and his ghostly duplicate uses Tesla\\'s device one last time to teleport himself into the body, hoping that he will either reanimate it and become whole again or kill himself instantly and so reunite with his other self in death.\\n',\n",
       " 'In the final section of the novel, Kate and Andrew\\'s mystery is revealed. Andrew Westley goes into the Angier family vault and finds all of Rupert Angier\\'s near-lifeless shells (the prestiges) labelled with the date and place they were created. Andrew also finds a prestige of a small boy labeled Nicholas Julius Borden, with his place of creation listed as Caldlow House. It is then understood that Andrew himself never had a twin. When Kate and Andrew were children, their families had met in an attempt to mend the rift between them. However, during an argument, Kate\\'s father had cast the young Nicholas Borden into the Tesla device, rendering the \"prestige\" Nicholas Borden lifeless on the ground and creating the duplicate who later became Andrew Westley. It is also revealed to Kate Angier and Andrew Westley that Angier\\'s attempt to become whole again was successful, and some form of Rupert Angier had continued to survive in the Caldlow House to the present day.\\n',\n",

       " 'David Langford wrote in a 1996 review, \"It seems entirely logical that Christopher Priest\\'s latest novel should centre on stage magic and magicians. The particular brand of misdirection that lies at the heart of theatrical conjuring is also a favourite Priest literary ploy – the art of not so much fooling the audience as encouraging them to fool themselves... The final section is strange indeed, more Gothic than science fiction in flavour, heavy with metaphorical power. There are revelations, and more is implied about the peculiar nature of the Angier/Tesla effect\\'s payoff or \\'prestige\\' – a term used in this sense by both magicians. The trick is done; before and after, Priest has rolled up both sleeves; his hands are empty and he fixes you with an honest look. And yet ... you realise that it is necessary to read The Prestige again. It\\'s an extraordinary performance, his best book in years, perhaps his best ever. Highly recommended.\"Publishers Weekly said, \"This is a complex tale that must have been extremely difficult to tell in exactly the right sequence, while still maintaining a series of shocks to the very end. Priest has brought it off with great imagination and skill. It\\'s only fair to say, though, that the book\\'s very considerable narrative grip is its principal virtue. The characters and incidents have a decidedly Gothic cast, and only the restraint that marks the story\\'s telling keeps it on the rails.\"Elizabeth Hand wrote, \"There is a certain amount of grim humor to The Prestige, the blatant Can-You-Top-This? careerism of dueling prestidigitators whose feud is carried out against the lush backdrop of fin-de-siècle London. And the novel provides the pleasures of a mystery as well, as the reader attempts to find the man (or men) behind the curtain, and discover the true parentage of Andrew Westley, who may or may not be related to Borden. But at its core The Prestige is a horror novel, and a particularly terrifying one because its secret is revealed so slowly, and in such splendid language... The Prestige is both disturbing and exhilarating – one closes the book shaken, wondering how it was done; and eager to see what the master illusionist will produce for his next trick.\"Adam Kirkman called the novel \"vastly underrated... Priest weaves together a tale of two feuding stage magicians at the turn of the century, a dark but mesmerising story that sees two men become consumed with, and eventually destroyed by, obsession. While the film hammers you over the head with clues about the final twist, so much so that you feel embarrassed when re-watching it, Priest\\'s novel is more subtle, although a smart reader is in on the trick from the start. The real beauty of this novel is the characters, who are fleshed out more fully here than on screen, and the magical elements of the story achieve a fantastical, creepy edge. If you enjoyed the film, then Priest\\'s novel is grander in scope and more chilling in nature, and is a gem that should not be ignored.\"The Guardian review said, \"Behind all the surface trickery lies an intelligent and thoughtful novel about the nature of illusion and secrecy, and about the damage done to those who appoint themselves keepers of such dangerous secrets.\"A review in Kliatt of the audiobook version narrated by Simon Vance described it as \"a spellbinding and entirely original neo-gothic thriller that moves the listener adroitly from the world of staged illusion to the otherworldly, from the historical...to the horror-laden, with all sorts of strange and dazzling stops along the way. The plot is convoluted and occasionally technical, spanning generations and incorporating multiple narrators and a large cast of characters. A lesser audiobook narrator might inadvertently muddle the story, but, as usual, Vance displays a dramatic and vocal range that is more than equal to his task. He enhances Priest\\'s novel with superb pacing and a host of highly convincing voices and accents.\"\\n',\n",

The bosses accept the Joker's offer, and he kills high-profile targets involved in the trial, including the judge and police commissioner.

Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the sequel to Batman Begins (2005) and the second installment in The Dark Knight trilogy. The plot follows the vigilante Batman, police lieutenant James Gordon, and district attorney Harvey Dent, who form an alliance to dismantle organized crime in Gotham City.

The ensemble cast includes Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Morgan Freeman.\\n',\n",
       " \"Warner Bros. Pictures prioritized a sequel following the successful reinvention of the Batman film series with Batman Begins. Christopher and Batman Begins co-writer David S. Goyer developed the story elements, making Dent the central protagonist caught up in the battle between Batman and the Joker. In writing the screenplay, the Nolans were influenced by 1980s Batman comics and crime drama films, and sought to continue Batman Begins' heightened sense of realism. From April to November 2007, filming took place with a $185 million budget in Chicago and Hong Kong, and on sets in England. The Dark Knight was the first major motion picture to be filmed with high-resolution IMAX cameras. Christopher avoided using computer-generated imagery unless necessary, insisting on practical stunts such as flipping an 18-wheel truck and blowing up a factory.\\n\",\n",
       " \"The Dark Knight was marketed with an innovative interactive viral campaign that initially focused on countering criticism of Ledger's casting by those who believed he was a poor choice to portray the Joker. Ledger died from an accidental prescription drug overdose in January 2008, leading to widespread interest from the press and public regarding his performance. When it was released in July, The Dark Knight received acclaim for its mature tone and themes, visual style, and performances—particularly that of Ledger, who received many posthumous awards including Academy, BAFTA, and Golden Globe awards for Best Supporting Actor, making The Dark Knight the first comic-book film to receive major industry awards. It broke several box-office records and became the highest-grossing 2008 film, the fourth-highest-grossing film to that time, and the highest-grossing superhero film.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Since its release, The Dark Knight has been assessed as one of the greatest superhero films ever, one of the best movies of the 2000s, and one of the best films ever made. It is considered the \"blueprint\" for many modern superhero films, particularly for its rejection of a typical comic-book movie style in favor of a crime film that features comic-book characters. Many filmmakers sought to repeat its success by emulating its gritty, realistic tone to varying degrees of success. The Dark Knight has been analyzed for its themes of terrorism and the limitations of morality and ethics. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2020. A sequel, The Dark Knight Rises, concluded The Dark Knight trilogy in 2012.\\n',\n",

Maurice Fischer dies, and the team sedates Robert Fischer into a three-layer shared dream on an airplane to America bought by Saito.

Cobb reveals that during their time in Limbo, Mal refused to return to reality, so Cobb performed inception on her to convince her, which led to her belief that the real world was still a dream world.

The hearings were motivated by politics and personal enmities, and reflected a stark divide in the nuclear weapons community. One group passionately feared the Soviet Union as a mortal enemy, and believed having the most powerful weaponry capable of providing the most massive retaliation was the best strategy to combat that threat. The other group thought developing the H-bomb would not improve Western security and that using the weapon against large civilian populations would be genocide; they advocated instead a more flexible response to the Soviets involving tactical nuclear weapons, strengthened conventional forces, and arms control agreements. The first of these groups was the more powerful in political terms, and Oppenheimer became its target.\\n',\n",
       " 'Rather than consistently oppose the \"Red-baiting\" of the late 1940s and early 1950s, Oppenheimer testified against former colleagues and students, before and during his hearing. In one incident, his damning testimony against former student Bernard Peters was selectively leaked to the press. Historians have interpreted this as an attempt by Oppenheimer to please his colleagues in the government and perhaps to divert attention from his own previous left-wing ties and those of his brother. In the end, it became a liability when it became clear Oppenheimer had really doubted Peters\\'s loyalty, and recommending him for the Manhattan Project was reckless, or at least contradictory.\\n',\n",
       " 'Popular depictions of Oppenheimer view his security struggles as a confrontation between right-wing militarists (represented by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (represented by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of weapons of mass destruction. Biographers and historians have often viewed Oppenheimer\\'s story as a tragedy. National security advisor and academic McGeorge Bundy, who worked with Oppenheimer on the State Department Panel of Consultants, wrote: \"Quite aside from Oppenheimer\\'s extraordinary rise and fall in prestige and power, his character has fully tragic dimensions in its combination of charm and arrogance, intelligence and blindness, awareness and insensitivity, and perhaps above all daring and fatalism. All these, in different ways, were turned against him in the hearings.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'The question of scientists\\' responsibility toward humanity inspired Bertolt Brecht\\'s drama Life of Galileo (1955), left its imprint on Friedrich Dürrenmatt\\'s The Physicists, and is the basis of John Adams\\'s 2005 opera Doctor Atomic, which was commissioned to portray Oppenheimer as a modern-day Faust. Heinar Kipphardt\\'s play In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer, after appearing on West German television, had its theatrical release in Berlin and Munich in October 1964. The 1967 Finnish television film Oppenheimerin tapaus (The Case of Oppenheimer) is based on the same play and produced by the Yleisradio company. Oppenheimer\\'s objections resulted in an exchange of correspondence with Kipphardt, in which Kipphardt offered to make corrections but defended the play. It premiered in New York in 1968, with Joseph Wiseman as Oppenheimer. New York Times theater critic Clive Barnes called it an \"angry play and a partisan play\" that sided with Oppenheimer but portrayed him as a \"tragic fool and genius.\" Oppenheimer had difficulty with this portrayal. After reading a transcript of Kipphardt\\'s play soon after it began to be performed, Oppenheimer threatened to sue Kipphardt, decrying \"improvisations which were contrary to history and to the nature of the people involved.\" Later Oppenheimer told an interviewer:\\n',\n",

After research at other institutions, he joined the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a full professor in 1936. He made significant contributions to theoretical physics, including achievements in quantum mechanics and nuclear physics such as the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for molecular wave functions, work on the theory of electrons and positrons, the Oppenheimer–Phillips process in nuclear fusion, and early work on quantum tunneling. With his students, he also made contributions to the theory of neutron stars and black holes, quantum field theory, and the interactions of cosmic rays.\\n',\n",

His leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project's success. On July 16, 1945, he was present at the first test of the atomic bomb, Trinity. In August 1945, the weapons were used against Japan in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict.\\n\",\n",
       " \"In 1947, Oppenheimer became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and chaired the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. He lobbied for international control of nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb during a 1949–1950 governmental debate on the question and subsequently took positions on defense-related issues that provoked the ire of some U.S. government and military factions. During the second Red Scare, Oppenheimer's stances, together with his past associations with the Communist Party USA, led to the revocation of his security clearance, following a 1954 security hearing. This effectively ended his access to the government's atomic secrets and his career as a nuclear physicist. Although stripped of his direct political influence, Oppenheimer nevertheless continued to lecture, write, and work in physics. In 1963, as a gesture of political rehabilitation, he was given the Enrico Fermi Award. He died four years later, of throat cancer. In 2022, the federal government vacated the 1954 revocation of his security clearance.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Review of Inception : My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.For someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan's remarkable works:\\n\",\n",
       " 'Memento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I\\'ve ever seen. But overall, it doesn\\'t reach the same level of Inception.The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven\\'t been able to find the very particular \"Nolan\\'s spirit\" in it.The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan\\'s nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience\\'s mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception.\\n',\n",
       " 'SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven\\'t watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!It is set in the world where there\\'s technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - \"extractors\" who use this technology to infiltrate the target\\'s subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of stealing, he wants them to plant an idea in a person\\'s subconscious, which is also called \"inception\". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels \"dream within a dream\", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito\\'s biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who\\'s dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father\\'s business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer\\'s mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb\\'s past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb\\'s case, it\\'s the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We\\'re now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn\\'t even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn\\'t care any more, what\\'s important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life.\\n',\n",

Maybe it was his English...Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie.\\n\",\n",

Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood\\'s most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he\\'s increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: \\'Inception\\'Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb\\'s \\'brainiac\\' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a \"forger\" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier.There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don\\'t just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! What a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the \\'Best Director\\' category. If \"Inception\" is a metaphysical puzzle, it\\'s also a metaphorical one: It\\'s hard not to draw connections between Cobb\\'s dream-weaving and Nolan\\'s film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan!My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : When I first watch this movie, I was just shocked with it\\'s twist. I\\'m not gonna mention details, because can\\'t share any spoilers.Simply this movie makes a complex story, that makes you question so many things. \"Why he is keeping her in his dreams?\" or whatever your question is answering with some well written line. That scene is the key to the whole movie. That line between Cobb and Mal answers all your questions at once.That\\'s why I like this movie so much. Some movies has that potential. Making a complex story that someone could answer with only one sentence. You\\'re waiting for that line for whole content. But most of the contents (I mean movie or TV Series) are not managing that well.Besides the greatness of the storyline this movie has a really great cast. So Acting Performances are also great. Award Winning Cinematography by Wally Pfister was too great. Original Scores by Hans Zimmer was brilliant. Visual Effects are unique. So not only the Screenplay but nearly all the technical details are great.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Dom Cobb leads a highly skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets from people\\'s minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea.Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It has been described by critics as \"a film that rewards intellect\", and I can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help of a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page (Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing photography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling music in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was also set the mood for Nolan\\'s previous film, The Dark Knight.While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind. Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together as beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement each other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both heart- wrenching and heart-pounding. It\\'s a film that manages to engross you with its complexities, yet comes together seamlessly, and will have you at the edge of your seat, quite literally from start to finish.Inception is magnificent.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Inception is as original as you can get with a sci-fi movie. I feel like it's kind of pointless to compare this to Blade Runner, Aliens, Terminator 2, 2001: A Space Odyssey or any other sci-fi blockbusters, for they're completely different. What Nolan crafted is genius, in my mind he is still yet to make a bad movie, it is now time to get into spoiler territory.Inception is a story about dreams, how you can build anything you want, Nolan took 10 years to write the screenplay and it was definitely worth-while, this is one of the most mind-blowing, nail-biting, epic action packed science fiction movies of all time. All the performances in this film are amazing, the special effects are flawless, the acting is flawless, the story is flawless, the writing is flawless, this is one of a few pictures that just got everything right in all categories, most people saw there is no such thing as a flawless movie and I would 100% love to disagree with them there, all of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen so far have no real flaws. Leonardo DiCaprio+Christopher Nolan= pure gold, these two should definitely collaborate more, Inception just proves that Chris is a cinematic God, from his screenplays, to his production, to his film direction, everything is perfect!You have to imagine it to believe it. Watching it once isn't enough, watching it twice isn't enough, you have got to watch this 10 times or even more to really get the true essence of why this movie is considered to be one of the greatest of all time. It is truly film-making at it's greatest! It is one of the most re-watch-able movies a director has ever put out! It's like Dark Knight, Memento and most of his other work where immediately after you watch it you feel like watching it again.At times it gets confusing because sometimes it feels like it's the real world when it is actually the dream world and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, oh my god! In my opinion it is his greatest performance. And Inception SHOULD HAVE WON BEST PICTURE! Fun fact: This film got nominated for Best Screenplay and many other Oscar nominations, yet they don't nominate the man who put it all together who DIRECTED THE GOSH-DARN MASTERPIECE!I watch this film at least twice a week and to see that Watchmojo put Social Network higher than Inception on their Top 10 Movies of the Decade list p*sses me off! Yeah, it's David Fincher, I get that Watchmojo love David Fincher, but higher than Inception? NAH!If anybody else directed this it would be an average, unoriginal and completely unimaginative piece of work. When Nolan gets his hands on something it is always going to be original, classic and everything great about movies. I'd place this on my top 5 films of the century list, most films on that list would include Nolan films because he is the best director working today and you have to accept that.More will be added soon...\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. \"Inception\" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. \"The Matrix\" (1999), \"The Cell\" (2000), \"Abre Los Ojos\" (1997) & its American remake \"Vanilla Sky\" (2001)), you really can\\'t look away, nor should you.\"Inception\" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people\\'s subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person\\'s mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the \"Matrix\" movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It\\'s especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I\\'ve never seen other than in drawings.However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn\\'t good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don\\'t get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However, some of the best films I\\'ve seen are confusing at first. \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) is a film I\\'ve seen a couple of times, and still don\\'t understand completely. It still has a major following, though, as I\\'m positive this movie will. It\\'s an incredibly entertaining movie, but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3.\\n\",\n",

Congratulations to the well deserved best director, writer, and producer of films (in my opinion).

       " \"Review of Inception : I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Christopher Nolan\\'s \"Inception\" (2010) is a complex science fiction thriller about a group of people with varying specific skills that create a perfect team of dream-sharers. Dom Cobb, the main protagonist, is an extractor who is able to find out people\\'s secrets by intruding into their dreams. His right-hand is Arthur, who researches and plans what they are trying to accomplish in a dream. Bright graduate student Ariadne is the architect for the dreams, meaning she literally constructs the physical aspects of a dreamscape. Eames is a professional at turning into anyone else in a dream, almost like shapeshifting. Lastly, Yusuf is a chemist who creates perfect concoctions of sedatives to achieve ideal conditions for the dreams to take place. This elaborate combination of characters is asked by a rich businessman, Saito, to infiltrate his dying competitor\\'s son, Robert Fischer\\'s, dream and place an idea in his mind so that Saito\\'s business can become more successful. Traveling through the layers of someone\\'s mind and making them think of an idea on their own is what they call \"inception.\" Cobb is dedicated to making this happen so that Saito can arrange for Cobb\\'s return to America to see his children. Without Saito, Cobb would not be able to return to America because of his alleged criminal background, but Saito has connections and power to clear his name. Some members of his team think achieving inception is impossible, but Cobb convinces them to be on board and they must come up with a mastermind plan with no room for error to achieve this extremely difficult yet imperative task. They begin a three-layer plan that involves elaborate depths of the dream dimension, taking advantage of Fischer\\'s sensitive and dysfunctional relationship with his father, practiced methods of leaving a dream and entering the next, all while trying to avoid Cobb\\'s wife Mal who lives in his subconscious and often sabotages his plans. The shocking ending leaves viewers at a cliffhanger and fans theorizing.Now that I\\'ve gone over the plot, let\\'s talk about the other components of the film. The marketing strategies did an excellent job gathering hype for the film. The movie poster features the famous actors that everyone was excited to see, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Elliot Page, and the rest of the dream crew. It also says \"Inception\" in a large red font and notes that is directed by the same director of \"Dark Knight,\" which was an insanely successful and highly rated movie that was premiered two years prior to Inception. Dark Knight scored a 94% on rotten tomatoes and is #112 on IMBD\\'s most popular movie list. This likely drew in the audience from Christopher Nolan\\'s movies and set a high expectation for the quality of Inception. Another great marketing move was the contents of the teaser trailer. The trailer features a brief voiceover of Leonardo DiCaprio and amazing scenes with impressive cinematography taken out of context that show the viewers the production value and exciting action contents of the film all while confusing them so that they go see the film when it is released. I think the shock factor and science fiction aspect of the trailer is owed to the scene where a city block starts to fold over top of itself.The content of the film stayed true to the marketing because the cinematography, directing, and acting is quite well-done. Starting with the cinematography, the zero gravity scenes and cityscape building from the ground up were very realistic looking and intensified the movie watching experience. There was a lot of attention to detail. The directing of Inception is very montage based. It draws amounts and amounts of suspense. For example, the montage near the end of the film with the van, the fortress, and the hotel was painfully long but created such thick suspense. For the acting, I only have compliments and no complaints. Inception was casted beautifully and everyone fit their roles perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job as Dom Cobb, especially in the emotional scene with his wife and two kids in one of the dreams. My personal favorite performance was Cillian Murphy\\'s role as Robert Fischer. He played as his character really well and he captured his relatively constant sadness surrounding his father situation.Inception is a staple film in the science fiction genre and is similar to a few other sci-fi movies as well. Inception is at #135 on IMBD\\'s most popular movie list and has a rating of 87% on rotten tomatoes, so there is no doubt about its quality. In my opinion, Inception is pretty similar to the well-loved movie \"The Matrix\" (1999) starring Keanu Reeves. They are both iconic science fiction and action films with themes of alternate realities. The second film I think is very similar is a more recent film, Tenet (2020) with Robert Pattinson. Tenet is also about bending the rules of science and is also directed by Christopher Nolan. If you enjoyed either of these movies, I recommend Inception. I also recommend it to general fans of Christopher Nolan\\'s directing, so if you have watched and enjoyed any of his films, you would probably like Inception too.On my rating scale of one to five, with one being the worst possible score and five being perfect, I give Inception a five. It has no weaknesses in my opinion. Every aspect of this movie combines into perfection. The acting and cinematography is what takes it over the top, and I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy in all of the roles they play. This is a movie I have voluntarily watched multiple times and it only gets better with each watch. It is very complex and a complete experience to view. My favorite aspect of the film is the ending. Many people say they hate cliffhangers, but I enjoy them because it leaves it up to the audience to imagine. Basically, you can choose your own ending based on what you think makes the most sense with the facts you are given in the film.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like most of DiCaprio's films, it blew me away.Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult). The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay. Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out? Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don\\'t look for...brains! \"What is the most resilient parasite? An idea\" says Leonardo Di Caprio\\'s character Cobb. Well, Inception is all about ideas. It\\'s all right there in the title. The film central idea revolves around \"Extractors\", who are paid to extract secrets from people\\'s subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival, \"Inception\" is born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, a piece of the film\\'s genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher Nolan\\'s script which, I imagine, is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio\\'s other instant classic this year, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese\\'s film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan\\'s film. There is style, charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy (femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautiful suits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it\\'s OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen!\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Many of us, not least those who populate the online world with movie reviews, observations and criticisms, are aware of Chris Nolan's raw talent. Memento broke onto the screen a decade ago and provided us with a spectacle in story telling so rare that it dumbfounded us. Since then, Nolan has gained huge popularity with his revival of the Batman franchise, and even more so with the stunning Dark Knight - that still has yet to relinquish its grip on modern day cinema - with the genius of The Prestige sandwiched in between.None of this, however, could have quite prepared us for the spectacle that is INCEPTION. A script that has been worked on for over a decade, Nolan's endeavours are inescapable in its pure complexity and brilliance - quite simply, one of the best film story lines audiences will have encountered in their lifetime. All this is supplemented superbly by the film's ensemble cast - DiCaprio's performance cannot easily be done justice without seeing it. With this and Shutter Island, now must be the time for his first Oscar - he has asserted his place as truly one of the best actors currently working. All reviews will confirm that Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy and Ellen Page back his performance up superbly with well-worked turns. Inception's action sequences play out wonderfully, being - along with the comic relief and back-stories - an integral part of the film's unravelling, whilst we remain rooted to the film's emotional stakes, which give immense purpose to the film's complex and layered narrative.Our protagonist battles with both outer and inner demons in his quest for redemption. The unique concept of entering dreams offers the opportunity not only for a unique species of heist but also a way to dig deeper and deeper into one's subconscious, and the ability to plant an idea which could define that person, or destroy them. In theaters around the world, Nolan uses his dynamic skill to plant an idea in our minds which together allows us to experience the very dream- share the film explores, one which will remain with us long after the film's emotional climax. Inception is a cinema experience so audacious, so incredible, and in the end so gratifying, that it truly is unmissable, and will remain a benchmark for many filmmakers in years to come.10/10.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : This is an excellent film. The CGI is great. The characters are great. But I have one problem which is the character development. It didn't have much of it, but that is the only problem. The movie did start of really confusing, but in the 40 minute part I got used to the story. In conclusion this is a great film and I would highly recommend it.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Fui ver este filme ao cinema baseando-me na classificação aqui atribuída(para o filme ocupar a terceira posição tinha que ser um bom filme), confesso que estava um pouco receoso pois a história parecia-me demasiado complexa e sem muita acção, um pouco ao género de Memento também realizado por este soberbo senhor(Christopher Nolan), sim é verdade que não achei Memento um grande filme. Não podia estar mais errado, este é sem dúvida um dos melhores filmes que já vi, a par de \"Gran Torino\" e \"Godfather Part.I\". Sim é verdade que é um filme um pouco complexo, mas é essa complexidade minuciosamente estudada e soberbamente realizada que torna o filme num grande \"clássico\" e futuramente relembrado como o melhor argumento original jamais escrito.Quero também saudar a prestação do elenco, de três em particular: Di Caprio não me surpreendeu pois fez o que sabe fazer como ninguém, Gordon-Levitt teve uma prestação à altura daquela que teve em \"(500)Days of Summer\", e Ellen Page conseguiu finalmente consagrar-se num grande filme confirmando o seu grande potencial. O resto do elenco está também de parabéns.Aconselho todo o mundo a ver este filme, mesmo aquelas pessoas que não gostam de ficção científica, pois este filme é único, e por favor não tirem os olhos do ecrã, pois cada pormenor é importante.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Boring of me to say but this is one of my favourite movies of all time. Stellar performances, great plot and an ending that keeps you guessing. The CGI is exceptional and I think it's arguably one of Nolan's best films.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : If one goes to an art gallery to see a provocative piece, one sees something new each time. That's what true art is. That's why a black light Elvis is not art. This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels. Great movie.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Review of Inception : I have been reading nothing but good reviews on Inception these past few weeks, now I knew from the minute I saw the trailer, I had to see this movie but I didn\\'t know what to expect. If you have seen the trailer to this movie, you know that it doesn\\'t explain too much. But I saw Inception today and all I can say is: Wow! With an incredible cast and amazing director, you just can\\'t go wrong. Inception is a movie that not only makes you think but can start a whole conversation with what you just saw on the screen. It\\'s a very clever story that is told with skill and passion, while you do have to pay attention, I loved that it made me think. One of my friends saw a premiere and told me how he would have to see it again to understand it, but I didn\\'t get that when I saw it today. But I would love to see the movie again, I have no problem with that. Between the performances, the story, the sounds, the editing and the incredible effects, I would love to watch this movie over and over again, it\\'s my favorite film of the year so far.Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible inception. He gathers a group of thieves that will pull this incredible mission off, teaching new comer, Ariadne their amazing world and how to alter it to their liking, but if gone too deep into making the dream into something strange, they could get lost and play limbo between reality and dreams. Even after all the lessons, instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one.To write a dream is a riddle, I love the way this movie was written. Christopher Nolan is one of my new favorite directors, he knows exactly how to write and tell a story. The only small flaw, this is a very small complaint, is that his stories while they\\'re incredible, can also be a bit exhausting. This film is a bit long to warn you in advance, it\\'s a little over two and a half hours long. I felt like there were a couple of things with the story that could have been trimmed, but like I said it\\'s such a small complaint because Inception intrigued me so much. To say that this film will be a contender for the Oscars is pretty much a guarantee with the sound, script, editing and effects. Hopefully I think it might be a runner up for best picture.One of the things I hate to do in a review is brag about a movie because I don\\'t want others to get over hyped with the film and to be disappointed when they see it. But honestly, I don\\'t think there isn\\'t one person I wouldn\\'t recommend this movie too. Inception has some of the most incredible effects mixing The Matrix and The Dark Knight, I think the \"Zero Gravity\" fight scene is one of the most amazing moments I\\'ve seen on the big screen. I loved how the story kept you thinking and going, guessing what would happen next and what was going on. A dream within a dream within a dream, you even begin to question with the characters what is a dream and what is reality. With a great cast and excellent director, Inception is everything I wanted and more, once again, Nolan created a masterpiece. Something from his own mind, Inception questions yours\\' and makes you wonder which world you are part of.10/10\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : This review is not so much a review but rather an attempt to understand the threads of the movie. It is by no means authoritative and all encompassing.The movie lays out many clues for the viewer. Particularly the notion that an \"idea\" is the most insidious infection. Once an idea has taken root only death can provide a release. Furthermore, some people\\'s realities eventually become a state of constant dreaming. Thus, it is possible for someone to constantly require to dream in order to maintain their grasp on reality.The next premise that we are introduced to is the notion that \"ideas\" can be taken from the mind. From that we are introduced to the notion of \"inception,\" or the planting of an idea in the mind. The reason that inception is so difficult is because every idea that the mind has can be traced back to the source. So for most of us, ideas in our head can be traced to someone or something (a speech, a book, a movie...). Powerful ideas are self-created ideas, they can change the world (the movie explores this quite nicely).The movie takes place in the dream world and in reality. At the end of the movie it seems that Cobb is still in the dream world. But how can that be, he is reunited with his children? My thoughts: 1) We know that Cobb and his wife Mal had managed to get stuck in the final phase of dreaming--pure subconscious. It was in this place that they built a life together of reconstructed memories. Unfortunately over time Cobb had enough and wanted out. Mal did not believe that they were living in a lie.2) Cobb, in order to get Mal to get out, had to plant the idea in her head that she was dreaming and that this reality was not real. He manages to do so successfully.3) In the real world Mal commits suicide because of the idea Cobb planted. He cannot forgive himself.4) The fact that Cobb feels so much guilt about what he did IS THE CENTRAL CRUX OF THE MOVIE. It is this guilt that does not allow him to \"see\" his children until he forgives himself.5) The movie also introduces us to the concept of paradox, the infinite loop that can be closed etc. This is a crucial step to understand because what Cobb ultimately seeks to accomplish is a paradox.6) The movie is truly about Cobb planting an idea in his own head but not tracing it back to himself. He needs to believe that he can forgive himself but not know that he initiated it.7) Throughout most of the movie, all the characters are PROJECTIONS of his subconscious. Ariadne is perhaps one of the most important projections because through her, he is being guided to his inception seemingly by someone else. She is a manifestation of his subconscious who is in essence helping him realize what he must do. In Greek mythology Ariadne is the Mistress of the Labyrinth, a subtle clue by Nolan.8) The idea requiring inception, is that \"he can return home\" to his children. The idea is simple but in order to introduce it Cobb needs to CREATE THE MOST COMPLEX world possible. This is done through the multiple dreams and multiple cast members who are ultimately projections. For evidence that it is a created world, keep in mind the numbers used throughout the last acts. Those numbers appear on the ticket that Cobb is holding. Those numbers may have special significance to Cobb, (perhaps the hotel where his wife committed suicide, the ages of his children, etc).9) When Mal attacks Cobb with a knife Ariadne shoots her. After which, Cobb let\\'s go of Mal as a memory. Memories are dangerous because they call attention to the dream. By getting rid of Mal Cobb rids himself of evidence that he is dreaming.10) When Saito makes the phone call and allows Cobb back in the U.S., it is done because Cobb can believe that someone else has taken away the restriction. It was crucial for that to be there even though Cobb at any point could have seen his children.11) The spinning top does wobble a little bit when Cobb leaves the room. This lends some credibility to the thought that it is \"reality,\" however we do not see the top fall indicating that the whole thing may still be a dream. This seems to be a paradox, Cobb believes this is reality (top wobbles), but this is a dream (top never spins out). Can something be real to someone but still be a dream? Another paradox is discussed next.12) The movie itself reveals itself to be a paradox because Cobb\\'s character plants an idea in his own head and then must disguise it. It means that over time Cobb figured out a way out from his guilt, it was a spontaneous idea (and quite brilliant). The problem is that he can still trace the idea back to himself. That would mean the guilt would still be there. Thus, the paradox is seemingly unsettled. How can one plant an idea in one\\'s own head without realizing that you planted it there? 13) With respect to the ending/beginning on the beach. Keep in mind, Cobb\\'s children appear but with backs to him on the same beach as his. It is the subconscious world. For proof that this is his dream, ask yourself \"how did he get from Mal\\'s house to Saito\\'s?\" Cobb just appeared. He \"needs\" to get Saito to leave because only then can he \"see his children.\" Also the room where Saito is in is built from memory. Cobb admitted that he has a tendency to do this.Nolan has indeed incepted our minds. Thank you for reading and reviewing.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : \"The mind is like an iceberg, it floats with one-seventh of its bulk above water.\" -Sigmund Freud Christopher Nolan\\'s \"Inception\" plays very much like its subject matter described so aptly above by Freud. On your first viewing, you will quite possibly only grasp just a fraction of its complexity, but the brilliance of what this reviewer proclaims as Nolan\\'s masterpiece lies in how engaging it is- even though you cannot quite fully comprehend what Nolan is trying to say. Indeed, it may take multiple viewings for one to absorb completely his audacious new creation that dares to tackle as dense and intricate a subject as that of dreams.It isn\\'t easy to understand the nature of dreams, particularly because they seem to defy logic. The same can probably be said of some of the elements in \"Inception\", but in order for one to understand what dreams really are, one has to first accept that they are not part of the conscious mind, and therefore cannot be understood by rationality. Freud proposed that the rational mind is just that one-seventh of the iceberg that we see, and the rest of the mind is made up of the preconscious and the unconscious. Freud also believed that dreams were the road to the unconscious and existed in the preconscious, a state between the conscious and the unconscious mind.It is in this context that Nolan invites his audience to approach \"Inception\". Here, Nolan imagines a world of corporate espionage where a thief enters a person\\'s mind during his dreams to steal ideas. This process he terms \"extraction\", done by a team of people who design the architecture of the dreams, plant several people including the subject into the dream, forge identities within the dream and then proceed to steal the idea from the subject. Leonardo DiCaprio is the master thief of them all, Dom Cobb, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt his long-time right-hand man Arthur.But this latest mission is different- a tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants him to plant an idea (so termed inception) within a rival\\'s (Cillian Murphy) mind in order that he will break up his ailing father\\'s business empire after he takes over. Cobb agrees to this dangerous mission- a fugitive wanted for the murder of his wife, Saito promises that if Cobb succeeds, he will wipe Cobb\\'s slate clean so he is allowed to return to the United States to see his children. So Cobb begins assembling his team- the architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), the forger Earnes (Tom Hardy) and the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao)- think of it like a heist, only much more complicated.As Cobb explains the rules of the game to his team while preparing for their mission, Nolan is too establishing the rules of his game to his audience- what it means to die in a dream, why one can feel pain even when you\\'re in a dream, the significance of the people you see in your dream, the difference between dream time and real time. Not to spoil the experience to you- but suffice to say that there are many many such rules that Nolan plays by in his movie. Those who have had some experience in the study of dreams will likely grasp this more quickly, but those who have not may take more time to accept the logic and regulations behind Nolan\\'s world- hence the multiple viewings.Regardless, there is no doubt that it is engrossingly intriguing. All this takes place in the first half of the movie, which sets the stage for the inception itself in the latter half, an ingenious conceit set within a world of layered dreams that defies any description. Nolan uses the interconnectedness of these elaborate dream layers to intercut several breathtaking action spectacles - the storming of a vault within the Arctic within a zero-gravity fight along a hotel corridor within a high-speed vehicular freeway chase. Each of these would be thrilling in their own right, but with Nolan\\'s vision, Wally Pfister\\'s expansive photography and Lee Smith\\'s fine editing, the simultaneous unfolding of these set-pieces is utterly riveting.Besides grand action, Nolan also delivers heart-wringing moments courtesy of Cobb\\'s troubled past with his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who threatens to wreak havoc on his missions by surfacing from his unconscious in the most inopportune manner. We\\'re kept in the dark most of the time, believing that Mal is an insidious presence Cobb is unable to eradicate, but Nolan\\'s reveal towards the end of the film that puts into perspective Cobb\\'s unresolved guilt delivers an emotional finish that will leave you floored.As with his previous movies, Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors who can best embody the characters in his films. While DiCaprio\\'s role here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island, there\\'s no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt. The rest of the supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly- Joseph Gordon-Levitt radiates confidence and suavity, Ellen Page displays suitable wit and grit, and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking performance.But \"Inception\" is Nolan\\'s vision through and through- and in fact, a visionary director and a master filmmaker at that. Many years Nolan spent refining his screenplay, and it shows in the great detail and complexity that makes \"Inception\" both an intellectual and visceral enjoyment- just take the names of the various characters, each of which have a special significance. With \"Inception\", Nolan invites you to open your mind to possibilities- possibilities of alternate realities, of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most importantly, of the power of imagination. It is that rare gem of a film that is so multi-layered, so profound and so fascinating that you\\'ll want to experience it again immediately after you\\'ve seen it- just so you can fully appreciate its genius.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : I'd like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. 6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. 2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks. Cheers!\\n\",\n",

With everything from the actors to the cinematography to the music, this movie without any elaboration perfected almost everything there is.Inceptions slow start is the only weak point of this movie. It begins intensely to then slows down for the next 20 - 30 minutes. While then finishing off as an impeccable film. Nevertheless, this is what brings the film down for me.The director Christopher Nolan managed to create a masterpiece with little to no mistakes. At no point during this intensely long movie did I feel bored. Instead, I was always excited and on my toes intrigued.The acting in this movie was phenomenal. A small number of great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances. It is truly beyond me how Dicaprio didn't win an Oscar for his performance.Meanwhile, also employing the greatest composer in history with Hans Zimmer, the music adds significantly. The music adds an extreme amount of excitement and keeps you constantly interested. Few composers can make you notice the music, but Zimmer succeeds per usual.To finish of the film was astonishingly shot. With beautiful eye-catching scenes.

       " \"Review of Inception : Inception is written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. The musical score is by Hans Zimmer and Wally Pfister is the cinematographer. Plot finds DiCaprio playing Dom Cobb, a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people. But one day he gets a different offer, one that will enable him to see his estranged children. To get his reward he must enact Inception, the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target. But Inception is thought impossible and should Cobb and his selected team fail? The consequences are unthinkable.There has already been much written and pondered about as regards Inception in the relatively short running time of its life. One can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time. For although it's arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's inescapable that Nolan's movie is this current generation's sci-fi classic. That Nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream, and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process, is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanship.Inception is a film that it's better to know nothing about before venturing into it, and then it asks, well Nolan asks, for your undivided attention. It's neither as confusing as some have painted it, nor does it have any tricks-peek behind the curtain type-up its sleeve. The truth is is that Inception has something for everyone; thematically speaking, and that's before we pore over the special effects that sees Nolan raising the bar considerably. As is the case with twisty high concept movies, interpretations are many, with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie. What forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles, with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over. There's also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with; that of course wont work for everyone, but that is just one of many strands that Nolan dangles for the discerning viewer.If that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the Super Hero genre, rest assured thrill seekers, Inception is also a loud swirly spectacle. The action is raucous, be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups, Nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled roller-coaster ride, aided superbly by Lee Smith's editing and Pfister's perfectly broad photography While Zimmer's score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains (ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr on 12 string) to craft one of the best scores of 2010. As I said, there's something for everyone here, making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbuster.Then there's the strong ensemble cast, led by a quite scintillating performance from DiCaprio. Following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in Shutter Island, DiCaprio has given 2010 two of its best lead performances. Here he gives real depth of emotion, the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on. His unfussy acting is easy to buy into, giving the character the air of believability, he is the glue that binds the whole film together. Murphy is wonderfully vulnerable, very much an axis in the narrative, while Levitt almost usurps DiCaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it. Special praise, too, for Ellen Page. Still in her early 20s, she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress' hands. While Hardy provides brawny levity and Berenger leaves a favourable mark.The Matrix meets Heat and Mission Impossible, only it's written by Phillip K.

Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Inception is a resplendent cinematic experience that had me hooked from the opening scene till the very end. As a viewer, I was enthralled by its intricate plot. The characters in Inception are deeply nuanced and expertly portrayed by a remarkable ensemble cast. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable.Visually, Inception is a feast for the eyes. Inception demands your full attention to grasp its intricacies; it requires active engagement and a willingness to navigate its twists and turns. Some may find its complexity overwhelming.Inception is a cinematic marvel that pushes the boundaries of storytelling. Does it qualify as what is known as a \"masterpiece?\" Yes. However, SOMETHING, just something, held me back from a 10/10 rating. I\\'m not quite sure what, but there\\'s just something small missing to get it to that perfect rating.In conclusion, would I watch it a second time? Yes. Would I recommend you to watch it for the first time? Yes.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Only a small handful of directors have the ability to make an audience wait on pins and needles for their next NON sequel release. For me, i cannot remember the last time i was this excited for a movie i know virtually nothing about. Now i know i may be speaking on my own here, but director Christopher Nolan very well may be the best director of our generation. Because the guy has not missed so far. \"Memento\", \"The Prestige\", The Batman Series......the guy is a loose cannon who fires nothing but cinematic gold. As time goes on, he only seems to get better and better. Hopefully he can continue the re-occurring trend.Okay, let me get this off my chest, because it feels like an alien ready to burst out of my chest........this is easily one of the 10 best movies i have ever seen in my entire life. And that is not because i built this up in my mind or bought into the hype generated around this film, because everything i thought this movie was going to be, fell short of what it actually was about 20 minutes into it. This movie is cinematic genius at it\\'s best, plain and simple. We have been due for a movie like this for a loooonnngggg time. And i don\\'t mean this year, or the recent string of poor movies that have been released......i mean we are due for a movie that actually changes the way we look at movies. Now i know one would be quick to say \"Well wait a minute, Avatar already did that.\". But that is where you would be wrong. James Cameron gave us a feast with \"Avatar\". This movie cooks you an entire Thanksgiving dinner.I could honestly sit here and try as hard as i could to try and describe the movie to you, and it wouldn\\'t make a lick of sense because the movie is beyond in-depth. Case in point.....you remember the first time you saw the first \"Matrix\", and how complex and deep the plot was. Well, in words, this movie makes that idea look like \"Kindergarden Cop\". No disrespect to \"The Matrix\" at all, but this movie is probably the most in-depth, detailed, complex, and entertaining movie ever created by man.And that\\'s all Nolan seems to do. He creates these scripts that almost take a life of their own. You get a glimpse of it in \"Memento\", and you certainly see it in action with \"The Prestige\"......how the actual plot outline and story, is the actual trick. In this movie, it deals with mazes, and in turn, the whole movie is like a giant maze that you try and figure out.But that\\'s where Nolan\\'s true genius comes in. Through out the entire picture, he gives you these little clues as to whats going on, like a puzzle, and he shows you how they all get put together, rather than putting it together for you. He leaves it up to the audience to do so. And that\\'s what makes this movie great, because he challenges the audience like no other movie i have ever seen.And speaking of things i have never seen. In order for a movie written this well to work, it must be shot in the same fashion. And Nolan, once again, out does himself. If you are a fan of cinematography, as i am as well, then this movie, literally, is your wet dream. Talking about these elaborate dream sequences is one thing, but seeing them in action is beyond anything you have ever seen on the silver screen. Throughout the entire film, i kept taking a napkin to my face to wipe the clumps of drool that were collecting at the bottom of my jaw.Bottom Line, this is a movie i could write a novel about, and it certainly deserves that attention. To pretty much sum it up, if you want to see the movie that is going to win best picture of the year, go and see this movie. If you want to see one of the best movies in the past 10 years, go and see this movie. If you want to see a movie that will pretty much change your method of thinking, then go and see this movie. God only knows how many movies i have seen in my lifetime, but i can say with complete just, that this is certainly one of the 10 best i have EVER seen.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : An incredibly unique film which deserves its plaudits purely for the intelligent world created. Whilst extremely complex, the 'science' allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part, although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point, for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene. It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.Visually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling. Having said that, it is really one of a kind, at least at this level, and so everyone should see Inception, if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into.\\n\",\n",

After that story begins.The movie is about a story of Thief and his Team who steal secret information through Dreams of the Victims. Actually the theme of this movie is about the dreams. There is lots a of real facts about dreams and I have never seen such a great movie about dreams.Leonardo Plays a main part.He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Actually I have no words for this movie.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time.I highly recommended to everyone to watch this great movie.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Review of Inception : Inception has a problem that I cannot bear: the constant that someone comes to explain the laws and how that world works. The creation of the character of Ellen Page (Ariadne) was for the sole purpose of explaining that to moviegoers. Not that it's bad, but at certain moments it seems like the movie becomes more class at school, to know how that universe works, instead of the characters in this movie live the adventure for themselves. In this aspect the film is didactic. And the space for the imagination is limited. In this aspect everything in this film is chewed, everything explained, where are the possibilities? I do not want someone to explain the universe, I want to see the characters live and react in this universe.Yes the ending leaves open the question whether that is a dream or reality, but it is a cheap gimmick instead of letting them our imaginations fly. If at the end of the movie the experience of the characters was a dream, so it was waste of two and a half hour, at least the Matrix shows the characters in the real world, and that it was not a dream inside a dream. The tension and time invested would not be a waste of time Not that it spoils the experience of the film, but it disturbs in some parts, mainly in the middle of the film, when the group is preparing for the assault. The concept is good, but it should be presented in a simpler way. Clearly Nolan was very ambitious in the concept of this film. But Nolan is quite integral in the proposal of his films, and he tries to put unknown concepts to the general public in such a cohesive way, even with the problem of trying to explain everything and other problems of pace are easily forgiven. Nolan tries to do his best in each of his films as if his movie was his last, as if his life depends on it. A great honesty on the part of Nolan, and this I can and I want to enjoy. Nolan is such an honest guy and scores points with me. It's the difference between the lousy movie director and an excellent director. The bad elements of Inception are not enough to spoil its qualities. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works. Not that the idea of Inception is innovative, this idea has been copied many times in other works (Paprika, Synecdoche New York and The Matrix are the most practical and common examples). But it's the way Nolan puts these ideas in the big budget blockbuster. Let's be honest here. Smaller or lower budget films are not seen by the general public due to the absence of of large production values (a great soundtrack, great locations for filming or great special effects, etc). See these ideas or concepts in a great Hollywood blockbuster made with such quality and care, it is amazing. And these ideas are embedded in the drama of the film in such a cohesive and exemplary way; it is applauding Nolan's professional integrity. This is why Nolan movies are so well received, he tries to put in these Hollywood blockbusters something more, something common in indie or smaller films, but with the financial aspect of the great studios to provide a better technical quality.Obviously there is quality on this movie; the large parallel sequences are exemplary. The parallel between the Van sequences, the hotel with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt (when character is awake in the elevator), the peak at the military base in the snow and the desolate city of Cobb and Mal is almost perfectly made with an all- encompassing soundtrack. Of course the sequences of action are lousy . And many dialogues are very weak. Two weaknesses in Nolan's movies.Bad things come with the good things. I suspect that the bad action scenes of Inception and Dark Knight were the reason why Nolan turned DKR into an action movie instead of trying to tell a good story, Nolan's ego should have been hurt by the criticism as he directs his action scenes in these two films. Particularly Inception and the action sequence in the snow with Tom Hardy. Too bad, sorry.But the performances are amazing, particularly Marion Cotillard as Mal. There are many layers in the various characters which Nolan conducts with mastery and the way they are inserted into the film is almost perfectly. Particularly in the initial sequence (which I thought would be a scene to showcase special effects, and Nolan proved me wrong). Or in the scene between Ariadne and Cobb, when Cobb tries to explain how his wife dies, and then discovered new layers of the character to reveal that in fact, he did have to do with the death of his wife. Of course this will be important to the outcome of the film. It is this ability to put the scenes and the flashbacks in certain key moments of the plot that Nolan shows much quality, and one of his long lists of virtues. Inception is a movie like any movie; it has its flaws, but also its virtues. But, for me the qualities overlap the defects, and in the end the movie is well worth watching. But is its legendary statute being worthy? If Inception was released in the 1980's would it have the same impact in that decade, as it had in 2010? Currently the commercial movies in Hollywood are in crisis. We live in an era of remakes, superhero movies and franchise fatigue without the studios or directors making an effort to improve with originality or at least with a little more original concepts. Inception's credit could be lower if today's Hollywood was not in such a decadent state. But nonetheless, Inception is still a good movie.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Inception is a movie you just have to see before you judge it. Maybe you should even see it twice. There are a lot of complex ideas here, and the movie spends a good chunk of time explaining them in the opening act.\\n',\n",
       " \"That main idea though, is something very unique and creative that is brought to life by outstanding filmmaking, everything you'd expect from a Christopher Nolan film. Writing and performances are also great across the board. The only problem with Inception is in ones own interpretation. Some may says it's pretentious and the ideas presented acctualy aren't fully understood by the creators and/or don't make sense. But I think that's a terrible angle to approach the film. It's Sci-Fi, you're not supposed to over-anylasie it in that way. It's meant to plant thought provoking ideas in your head, which I beleive it does very well, not be a perfectly logical and plausible idea. Yes, it does have a few questionable sequences and scenarios, esspecally at the end, but it doesn't drag the rest of the movie down at all to me. It's a must watch\\n\",\n",

This really feels like a movie that only he could make! A mind bogling mix of ideas and creativity, as the concept of dreams are told to the viewer in a way, so that it never becomes too much! This is one of those movies that hooks you from beginning to end!The plot is engaging and you never know what to expect as the movie builds up and becomes more and more intense and thrilling! This is also a journey of guilt, confronting yourselves and learning to move on! Directing is amazing with some truelly iconic scenes such as the hallway fight which is expertly made and filmed!

       " \"Review of Inception : A few years back when I saw The Dark Knight, I thought now thats what made me fall in love with Hollywood. However, Inception made me remember what sheer brilliance this movie industry can create and puts it worlds apart from our Bollywood. SHOCK and AWE !!!! That sums up my experience. As many have already said this is Nolan's masterpiece. The CGI just took it to the next level. I don't favour the recent 3D trend and I thank the producers for not doing something like that to this movie, but considering the story and cinematography I wouldn't have minded, if they had. The acting is not the strongest part of this movie, most of the characters have very little to showcase in this movie. Yet, Joseph Gordon Lewitt,Ken Watanabe, Marion Cotillard did justice to their roles. Leonardo DiCaprio's character was the only thing that had some weight and he performed Brilliantly. (I wish he gets an Oscar nod at least). Brilliance is the only word that can define his performances these days. Nolan has become the go to guy for many new projects for Warner Bros. these days and this is just proof of why it is so. The way this movie has been presented, I cannot give it another name rather than A MASTERPIECE. It shakes you, makes you think and amazes you with the effects, the performances and the story. Nolan deserves every credit that he gets for making such a beautiful and mind boggling movie.The reason I compare it to Matrix is because it makes you think and imagine beyond your normal horizon. It actually requires you to sit and take in everything that is given so that you can enjoy it to the fullest. The reason why I love it even more is because these days with movies like Twilight and all in which you don't have to use your head, this one actually titillates your mind and senses. Now usually when I see such a movie I'd suggest everyone of my friends to check it out. But I caution you to only go watch this movie if you plan to take your Brain with you. It ain't that, keep your head out of the theatre, movie. So if you end up disliking it, Its purely due to lack of concentration.It's simple you would either call it ridiculously Awesome or just plain ridiculous, it all depends on you. The Special effects are outrageous, Leonardo Dicaprio is as usual Unbelievable, the Action sequence is Thrilling, Nolan has gone Over the Top. Yet, what everyone should look-out for is, the story. Note: I haven't seen Paprika and many have complained about it not being credited. I cant say if that is right or wrong, however I personally believe that no anime has yet found a better big screen extravaganza. All I can ask, is for Nolan to watch Death Note. We'd all love that. wouldn't we? The Best Part: The Climax of the movie was the best, I have seen in ages. The audience is devastated, amazed, given hope, rejoiced, then practically left jaw dropped and hung; asking just one question: WAS THAT A DREAM?\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Sci-fi films are loved all around the world these days. 'The Matrix', 'Donnie Darko' and my personal favorite 'Brazil'. But here comes another film by director Christopher Nolan who finished 'The Dark Knight' 2 years ago and now is ready to do another movie. The critics and the audiences loved it. While I consider it as the worst Christopher Nolan film ever. And here's why.Now I must say that I don't think this is horrible. There are quite a lot of good things in this movie. First of all, the special effects are amazing. There's this scene where the other side of the street starts to bend and it meets the other side of the street. Cars are driving upside down and all those crazy things are happening. It was awesome. Second, the music is ground-breaking. There's always this big boom that comes out in the movie and it just makes your heart rattle. Third, the premise is brilliant. The idea of going into a dream and stealing somebody's thought is a premise that only Christopher Nolan can write. It is amazing at those points and I could've liked it.But there is one big problem I had with this movie. And that was the acting. The acting was horribely bland. It has no taste and I just think that the acting starts to get boring. Leonardo Dicaprio's acting has hardened as time went by. He was amazing in one of his first movies 'What's Eating gilbert grape' which is one of my favorite movies of all times. And of course I had a problem with Ellen Page who I thought was so good at acting after I watched 'Juno'. But no, she is so boring in this movie too. The characters doesn't help much. There is not a bit of character development is this movie. And I want good characters when I watch a movie.On the whole, I don't think this movie is terrible. It has its bad and good. I think he should go back to this days of 'The Dark Knight'. I know a lot of people loves this movie but for me, it's the worst Christopher Nolan film ever. But it's worth a watch if you know what a good movie is. I give it 6/10!\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : I\\'m a big fan of Christopher Nolan\\'s work and according to me Inception is the masterpiece of it. Everything in this movie is perfect as per my requirements. There is enough mystery, action, drama, sci-fi and effects. The plot is perfect and Nolan did great in the development of that fantastic idea. I could not want nothing more from the script and the realization of it. As it comes to the cinematography Nolan was exceptional in what he have done in this movie. The final is a bit different and unexpected but perfectly made and all of the people who watch the film will be asking themselves the question: \"What happened?\". The actor\\'s play is great too, I think that Leonardo Di Caprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are awesome in their roles. It\\'s not strange that Nolan is working with some of the supporting actors in more than one of his movies. Despite the most attention went to Di Caprio and Gordon- Levitt the others should not be passed. Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwaite and Michael Caine did great too. I want also to mention Tom Hardy. I didn\\'t know him before Inception, but he is one of the actor who won my attention and I enjoy his acts in other movies too. As it comes to the soundtrack, I think that just mentioning the name of the Hans Zimmer should be enough for the movie fans. According to me Zimmer is the best in the business. Once I checked his biography I was more than impressed with the fact that he made soundtracks for more movies than I could though. The most impressive part is that he did it for great ones, not just for some mediocre films. The soundtrack of Inception is one of the little that I listened after watching the movie.According to me it is quite normal that Inception won Oscars for cinematography, visual effects and sound, but still it is very strange that the academy awards for best movie, best actor and best writing were not given to Nolan\\'s masterpiece. I really think that Inception is far better in every aspect than King\\'s speech and I know that this topic is widely discussed but Di Caprio was great and deserved the award more than Collin Firth.As a conclusion I will definitely suggest to everyone who didn\\'t watched Iception to do it as far as he could, because he missed on the greatest movies ever. I gave 9/10 because 10/10 is waiting for the movie that is still not done.\\n',\n",

It just makes soo much fun watching these Characters do their thing...On top of that the movie has such a great soundtrack. Hans Zimmer has once again topped himself.

       " 'Review of Inception : I walked into the theater knowing relatively nothing about this film, and I walked out...knowing even less. From the moment it begins to the moment it ends, you will be wondering what is going on. These initial questions are simply because those trailers we\\'ve been watching all year have hardly prepared us for what is about to happen. Most of us just buy a ticket on our faith in either Christopher Nolan or Leonardo DiCaprio. (In my case: both.) As the movie progresses, your questions grow deeper, more layered, just as the dreams you are viewing excavate the furthest reaches of the unconscious. It\\'s an absolute ride, and in IMAX, it\\'s astounding.It\\'s easy to see how this is the product of Nolan\\'s work in Memento. It deals with the same issues of our narrator\\'s reliability and questions of reality. Both main characters have a tragic self-awareness that seems like a plus in the beginning of the movie, but by the end, you\\'ll wonder if what they trusted to be true and what you trusted to be true is even true at all. Like the dreams themselves, the plot lines and characters begin to fall apart, but our Architect, Christopher Nolan, is the one pulling the strings. This is a film that moves beyond its medium and pulls you in. I\\'d almost say it breaks the fourth wall without even trying to.It goes without saying that the special effects are one of the highlights of Inception. This will probably be The Matrix of our time, but in a much subtler way. As Dom says, \"It\\'s only when you wake up that you realize there was something strange.\" This strangeness is embraced and pulled throughout the film. However, the mazes, infinite staircases, and alternate realities these special effects create are not limited to just providing an aesthetic wonder, but they serve to symbolically reinforce many of the main issues of the film. The paradox of an infinite staircase will be itching your brain for a few hours after you finish watching.The performances are pitch perfect. I initially thought that the characters were a bit one- dimensional and not incredibly developed. Don\\'t be alarmed though. Nolan hasn\\'t lost the touch that created his Batman and his Joker. I believe there are deliberate reasons for this lack of background, which will surely feed into the theorists that will begin sprouting all over the internet after this weekend. Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard provide the emotional and narrative center of the film. Being the Oscar winning and nominated actors they are, these roles are played beautifully. It\\'s as if they don\\'t even realize they\\'re the ones we\\'re all focused on. I would\\'ve given this a 10/10 if it weren\\'t for the excessive use of Hans Zimmer\\'s music. I\\'m a major fan of Zimmer\\'s work, but I believe music in a film is instrumental when trying to give your audience some sort of cathartic release. At the moment I needed that from the score, it had already been playing non-stop for an hour, so it really made no difference in my emotional response. That\\'s my only complaint, but I\\'m a film score nerd so don\\'t worry about it.I\\'ll end this now before I start confusing myself even more. It\\'s a privilege, though, to see an auteur like Christopher Nolan working today, using the summer blockbuster as his medium. You\\'ll leave the theater feeling as if you just \"witnessed\" something.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Inception (2:28, PG-13) — 9 — Science Fiction; biggie; original2009 was an amazing year for SF&F movies, with 7 original films (Avatar, District 9, Inglourious Basterds, Inkheart, Star Trek, Up, and Watchmen) getting my top rating of 9. 2010 so far has been disappointing, with only 4 (How To Train Your Dragon, Kick-Ass, Shrek Forever After, and Toy Story 3) getting as high as 8. But the dry spell is finally over, and in absolutely smashing fashion.Christopher Nolan has a grand total of 9 films to his credit, but they include such outstanding productions as Memento (2000), The Prestige (2006), and The Dark Knight (2008). Furthermore, in addition to directing, he co-wrote the screenplays for those movies with his brother Jonathan. They were marvels of intricacy, with layer upon layer of hidden meaning and nuance, slowly revealed as the story progressed. Now, as solo screenwriter and director, he has produced a masterpiece, the mind-blowing Inception.He takes an idea which I 1st read about in Douglas Hofstadter\\'s Pulitzer Prize–winning 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, and turns it into a riveting drama. Hofstadter wrote about a storyteller who gets his protagonist to a cliff-hanger point in a story, then has him start telling another story, which in turn leads to its own crisis, and then again, and then again. After the crisis is resolved at the final, deepest level, we go up and up and up again, and finally out. Only then does Hofstadter call our attention to the fact that we went down 4 levels but only came back up for 3 of them.Nolan uses this same idea (along with some Escherian visuals) with a wrinkle: It\\'s not a story, it\\'s a dream, and the dreamers are wired together so they share each others\\' experiences. Furthermore, there\\'s a time-dilation effect (familiar to most people from their own dreams at least as far back as Mark Twain\\'s \"The Great Dark\") in which an hour in dreamland is only 5 minutes in the real world. And if a person in dreamland goes into a deeper dream, the effect is compounded, so that a seeming lifetime can pass during only a short nap.In the near future, a small coterie of researchers has gotten good at this, and they make some shady money extracting hidden memories from the subconscious of people whose dreams they invade. Then a new proposition comes along. Wealthy power-company tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants to do the opposite — not to retrieve a memory but to plant one in the mind of Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy), the heir to the rival Fischer-Morrow Corp. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is confident it can be done, despite the misgivings of the rest of his team, but he warns that it will require going down multiple layers, for 2 reasons: (1) the new idea has to be so subtly insinuated that the target will think he came up with it himself, for reasons he would find credible, and (2) Fischer has undergone training to resist this very kind of dream incursion, and his subconscious comes equipped with alarms and security guards to snap him out of any ordinary dream state.But wait, there\\'s more! Normally, when you\\'re \"killed\" in a dream, you just wake up. But this endeavor involves not merely multiple levels but also a powerful anesthetic, and the combination means that anyone \"killed\" in dreamland will stay there forever, in a kind of limbo, lost to reality.And still more! Cobb\\'s dead wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) shows up every time he enters dreamworld, whether he\\'s the primary dreamer himself or piggybacking on someone else\\'s. Even tho she\\'s just a figment of his imagination, he\\'s got a really GOOD imagination, and she has her own reasons for wanting to keep him in the dream state, so she\\'s always trying to thwart his best-laid plans. So Cobb himself can\\'t have TOO much knowledge, in his waking state, of whatever imaginary world they\\'re planning to take the target into. But, while he recognizes this in himself and compensates for it, he has other blind spots that could endanger his entire team. Fortunately, he\\'s engaged the brilliant young architect Ariadne (Ellen Page) to design his mazes for him, and she tumbles to some of his personal demons.But wait, there\\'s STILL more \\x85And so it goes, layer upon layer, complexity atop complexity, and you start to think you shouldn\\'t be able to tell the players without a scorecard, but somehow Nolan gives you just enuf visual cues to help you keep straight at least 4 simultaneous story threads, as he intercuts rapidly between them.It is a tour de force, the best SF&F movie of the year. It\\'s not for slow learners, but anyone who\\'s easily bored will have absolutely no problem staying awake. Indeed, after this, you may be reluctant to ever fall asleep again.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : This movie has everything. The production and cinematography is exceptional. The story line is original and forces you to think and challenge your thoughts.

       " \"Review of Inception : All of the complaints that I have seen about this movie were ones explaining how viewers did not understand the movie. Honestly, the movie is really simple to follow, if you pay attention. I've only seen it one time and I understood everything. Many are saying that they want to see it twice in order to grasp everything, but one viewing is enough if comprehension is all you want to get out of the second viewing. This being said, I would love to see this movie a second time. The acting is outstanding and the chemistry between the actors makes the movie so pleasant to watch. You instantly forget that these are actors. The chemistry between Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt is phenomenal. Also, Leonardo is unbelievable as always, and no one can look better in a suit. The topic is so engaging and I would recommend this movie to anyone. It has been my favorite movie so far this year, and I will definitely be purchasing it as soon as it comes out onto DVD. Spend the money, see the movie, pay attention, and everything will be great.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Watching Inception with its futuristic emphasis on getting inside people's heads through dreams, especially hearing Leonardo DiCaprio explain the pitfalls to newbie Ellen Page, I couldn't help thinking about Forbidden Planet and that warning about monsters from the Id. Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could not?Christopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times, it still is an unmistakable masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and he's essentially a cat burglar of the mind. His mission usually is to invade people's dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent. But Leo's also a wanted man.Some problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds. He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught, but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate, Cillian Murphy. It's not to steal anything, but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team. The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride. And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on others.Very nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category. Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolan's dialog with verve and conviction. I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Review of Inception : I\\'m nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn\\'t follow up to \"The Dark Knight\", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can\\'t help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film \"Paprika\" in the whole \"invading dreams\" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it\\'s either all-visuals-no-smarts (\"G.I. Joe\", \"Transformers\") or the exact opposite (\"Doubt\", \"Invictus\"). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan\\'s perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can\\'t explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It\\'s like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film\\'s humanity, and this is where \"Inception\" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That\\'s right, years.Once the film ends, you\\'ll want to watch it again, for there\\'s something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film\\'s ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (\"Avatar\" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort \"Shutter Island\". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can\\'t seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (\"The Dark Knight\"). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie\\'s quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer\\'s complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that\\'s really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And \"Inception\" can proudly stand alongside \"Blade Runner\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film\\'s point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this.As for the movie, I\\'ll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It\\'s just not the sort of movie I\\'d usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did, however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films, I can\\'t think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special effects. Third, it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in \"Titanic\"--his maturity and grit were welcome. Also, seeing the kid from \"Third Rock\" suddenly playing an action hero was great--you\\'d barely recognize him--or the other grown child actors. Fourth, I loved the ending--it really pulled everything together very well.So why am I not giving the film a glowing review? Well, I am simply not an action film fan. And, the insane pace, TONS of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times. I much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film. Also, while Ken Watanabe is a fine actor, I had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he said--to the point where I wish they\\'d either dubbed him or had caption! Now this is NOT just because I am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearing--my daughter, too, found his thick accent difficult. On the other hand, Ms. Cotillard was VERY easy to understand and I was surprised how well she controlled her lovely French accent.I could probably go on and on about the film--as it\\'s long, complex and VERY prone to be one to watch and re-watch and discuss with friends. However, at this point, there are already a bazillion reviews and 7 billion people have already gone to see it, so I\\'ll call it a day.Well worth seeing....but perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Though this was a very good, on your toes, don\\'t blink kind of movie. In the end, I had to ask myself, \"Was it all a dream?\". Acting superb and directing on point. Very good movie.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Acclaimed director Christopher Nolan scores with the general movie-going audience once again with his highly anticipated film INCEPTION (2010). The hook for this film is it\\'s exploration into the concept and idea of \"dreams\". Frankly, my immediate response when I saw this film was that the it\\'s definition of dreams seems to be more based on NOLAN\\'s interpretation and not the general consensus! Some of it sounded correct, while some of it sounded like mumbo jumbo! At the same time, Nolan essentially executes the dream aspects of the movie within his own set of rules and more or less does not violate them, which is actually part of the problem. In the big picture, I don\\'t think dreams work the way this movie portrays them.INCEPTION stars Leonardo DiCaprio as dream expert extractor Cobb. DiCaprio gives a passable performance, but it\\'s not anything mesmerizing or Oscar-caliber. Frankly, I think that this actor is probably the most overrated major star of the last decade. It\\'s partially that he\\'s a victim of his eternal youthful look, so it makes it hard to take him seriously in these \"adult\" roles; I feel like he\\'s being forced upon me as a star, rather than truly being one! Unlike when he was a teen actor in the early to mid 90s, I don\\'t find him very engaging as an adult actor. He simply doesn\\'t draw me in. And, actually, in this movie, I was more engaged by the other ensemble\\'s performances more than his. He felt like a 5th wheel, especially since it was his character that was actually an impediment to the mission succeeding.The real acting standouts in the film for me were Cillian Murphy and former Best Actress Oscar winner Marion Cotillard. Murphy plays the team\\'s target Robert Fischer, whose billionaire industrialist father had recently died, so Cobb\\'s team was on an assignment, paid by Fischer\\'s main competitor Saito (a solid Ken Watanabe) to implant an idea in his mind to liquidate his father\\'s empire. Murphy did a much better job showing depth and character detail than DiCaprio, whose tale was actually more tragic, with his dreams haunted by the memory of his late wife Mal (hauntingly played by Cotillard, and I actually didn\\'t realize it was her until the end credits rolled!). The capable supporting cast playing Cobb\\'s \"dream team\" is led by up and coming star Ellen Page (as Ariadne, a specialist in architecture, who constructs the dream landscape for the film\\'s big mission). Although she was underused mainly as a fascinated observer and Cobb\\'s support, I found Page to be very engaging. After constructing the dream landscape, Ariadne\\'s assignment was to protect Cobb from his demonic subconscious in the form of his late wife Mal. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fine also as Arthur, Cobb\\'s sidekick who monitors the dreamers to ensure that they eventually get \"kicked\" (treated rather flimsily in this movie!) out of them. Tom Hardy is also good as Eames, a forger whose expertise is needed in the dreams to shapeshift his appearance to the dreamer. Dileep Rao soundly functions as chemist Yusef, creator of the drug that will allow the team to go into 3 levels of dream states in order to execute the mission.Where INCEPTION actually drew me in was in the last half, with it\\'s steamrolling action sequences as the dreamers went from level to level, which I did not expect at all! I thought this was going to be some kind of mind-bending, trippy exercise, which it really wasn\\'t. The way the movie portrays dreaming is actually very pat and linear, and the miniscule complexity is what allows the viewer to follow and be more engaged in the action. That is, while not completely mindless (pardon the pun!), the dream state stuff is pretty easy to follow. Also, Nolan did a good job of defining how the different levels work in the film\\'s opening sequence.My biggest complaint about the film is it\\'s rather simplistic way of describing dreams, and this ties in with the DiCaprio character Cobb, who was the biggest detriment to the mission because of his subconscious drawing his wife Mal into the dreams at inopportune moments. Other than the dreamer himself, why weren\\'t any of the other teams subconscious in the dreams coming into play? Basically, Cobb was the only team member whose subconscious posed a wild card threat, which is hard to believe. If you take Cobb out of the equation, the mission runs a lot smoother than it actually did. Cobb is the only reason for a true threat to exist and for there to be any suspense, and after a while, I found the Cobb-Mal stuff to be more of a distraction than an important plot point. Minus Cobb, the movie is really just a simple action flick with no true threats in the dreams other than the main dreamer\\'s typical subconscious threats, which were basically a bunch of useless gun-toting brutes who couldn\\'t hit the side of a barn! Again, it was all very entertaining, but definitely not groundbreaking.INCEPTION was nominated for Best Picture, in part I think due to the fact that there are 10 nominations now. Chances are it would not have been nominated if there were only still 5 since Nolan himself didn\\'t garner a Best Director nomination. Enteraining experience, but definitely not Oscar-worthy.\\n',\n",

A mild, subtle infodump feeling arises at times. There are no natural lulls or pauses to digest info. The first time watching you will feel absolutely lost for the first 45 minutes or so unless you read spoilers first, due to a combination of that flow and some out of sequence story telling. The 2nd time watching will be much more enjoyable than the first... it is that lesser enjoyment the first time through that keeps it from being amazing, knocking it down to just very good. There are two main storylines, one mostly in the present, the other about the main character's past...found myself wondering if the latter could have been less prominent or even cut to focus more on the former.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Nolan is careful never to let the scope of the film overwhelm the human element and this is a key reason Inception works as well as it does. The acting, from a great ensemble led by DiCaprio, is as good as it gets. In terms of sheer originality, ambition and achievement, Inception is the movie of the summer, the movie of the year and the movie of our dreams. world need directors like Nolan,Spielberg,Cameron, As with his previous movies, Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors who can best embody the characters in his films. While DiCaprio\\'s role here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island, there\\'s no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt. The rest of the supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly- Joseph Gordon-Levitt radiates confidence and suavity, Ellen Page displays suitable wit and grit, and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking performance.But \"Inception\" is Nolan\\'s vision through and through- and in fact, a visionary director and a master filmmaker at that. Many years Nolan spent refining his screenplay, and it shows in the great detail and complexity that makes \"Inception\" both an intellectual and visceral enjoyment- just take the names of the various characters, each of which have a special significance. With \"Inception\", Nolan invites you to open your mind to possibilities- possibilities of alternate realities, of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most importantly, of the power of imagination. It is that rare gem of a film that is so multi-layered, so profound and so fascinating that you\\'ll want to experience it again immediately after you\\'ve seen it- just so you can fully appreciate its genius.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Say what you want of Nolan, the new populist demigod of Hollywood: that his movies are overplotted, his themes overstated, his structure wonky. However, you have to give it to Chris: he is generous. Other writers/directors live and die by a single gimmick, but he keeps throwing more and more ambitious stuff at the screen - he reminds me of Philip K. Dick, another artist who casually poured in a few pages more ideas than many of his colleagues used in a half-dozen books.Nolan has the same high-concept vitality: amnesiac protagonist tries to avenge his wife guided by tattoos on his body and Polaroid pictures (still his best, by far); a feud between illusionists in early 20th century London gets increasingly nasty.In Inception, con men use a special technology to navigate through people\\'s dreams and steal their secrets. From the tone-perfect James Bond prologue to the climactic hurricane of set pieces, the movie transcends its limits - its clunky rules and the fact the dream world mechanics are not exploited as creatively as they could have - and succeeds thanks to its juicy premise and jaw-dropping cast, with Di Caprio in another of his \"tormented young man\" turns he has been perfecting since The Departed, Michael Caine, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy.Then we have gorgeous Marion Cotillard in Inception\\'s most poignant idea - the protagonist, obsessed by his dead wife, tries to recreate her, but she ends up as a distorted, menacing memory haunting his fragile dream world.8/10\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Great ideas grow like a cancer. Sometimes you never really know where they come from.Chris Nolan has never really had a totally original idea. Like Tarantino, he knows other movies so well, their ideas creep into his work, either intentionally or not. While my words on originality may come as inflammatory, my feeling toward his talent, and films is quite the opposite. He's good - real good. But he isn't original. Nobody is. This is the 21st century folks and its all been done. It is the way he's showing us these familiar things, that keeps us coming back.Except for Di Caprio, who never really convinces as a brooding widower/father, the rest of the band is perfect. Not that any of them are actually interesting, the plot is the real character in Inception. Hans Zimmers score is majestic and hugely epic and Wally Pfister's familiar clean visuals make it easy on the eyes.Much like a new roller-coaster at 6 Flags, Inception is a ride we've been on on before. Dreams, reality and all that jazz, but this one has a deeper dose of rabbit hole. We have a heist film set in the frame of corporate psychological espionage - whatever the hell that is.We get Matrix style pseudo reality and weightless gun fights. We get The Game and Total Recall style onion layers. We get the old man in the bedroom of cubist proportions from the Kubrick 2001 finale. Maybe one too many James Bond ski battles. And I'm just getting warmed up. The wife story rings hollow - in fact, it's downright boring. Exposition goes in circles and we never do get enough Watanabe Ken. But it's that layered time of the tiered dreams that makes this one go boom. The elevator that can't drop and that van that just falls forever with the cameras over cranking at 150 frames per second or more. But we don't want it to hit the water. Go deeper Cobb, cause I don't want to get off this one yet. The final joke with the unending spinner? This is Nolan's dream, not Cobb's.It's not visionary, it's not original, but just like the meandering Dark Knight or the wretched nonsense of the Prestige, or the titanic plot holes of Memento, Inception is a rabbit hole that owns you\\xa0til\\xa0it's over.

       " 'Review of Inception : I loved the whole concept and most of the movie. I felt that there was a lot to cover and very little time to do that. It was a bit all over the place. I also think that there were so many subplots and uncovered past events that made this movie confusing. For example, even though I loved Cobbs background with Mal and all that he had learned from it, it was a bit much. I feel like they could have dumbed it down and made it a bit less complex, like for example the presence of the Professor, it made me so confused. Yet, now that I think about it, I really did love that the rest was so complicated: The dreams within the dreams, the way they made Robert Fisher decide to split up the company, the complications that they had because of the heavy sedation, and so much more. I also like the ending, very freaky and just a great end to such a wonderful movie.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : What drew me to watch this film on the very first day of theatrical showing was the cast, which was an incredible array of some of the most intense actors in Hollywood today. We have Ken Watanabe, Cilian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Michael Caine, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwait, and in the lead, none other than Leonardo di Caprio. The director and writer Christopher Nolan also comes with a very impressive oeuvre behind him, with \"Memento,\" \"The Prestige,\" and most recently, \"The Dark Knight.\"This film is one of the most complicated films I have seen. A fair summary is almost impossible to put into words. It is challenging to follow all the jumping into and out of dreams, in dreams within dreams. I won\\'t be surprised if you do not completely understand everything that was going on by the end. However, the visual experience of being in this multi-layered dream world is unmatchable in any recent films.I thought of \"The Matrix,\" and even Leo\\'s latest (excellent) work \"Shutter Island,\" as this film proceeds to disorient you about what is and is not reality. However, \"Inception\" goes several levels higher in the hierarchy of convolutions in film. There are at least four levels of simultaneous dream upon dream happening at one time at one point. Amazing film editing work!Then there are technical aspects which were mind-boggling indeed, as Nolan\\'s bizarre script required. The audience is brought inside buildings, rooms, elevators, even entire cities where you lose the sense of space, time, gravity and logic. It is a dream world--you need to see it to fully appreciate what I just wrote. The musical score of Hans Zimmer was strong and dramatic. These are definitely contenders by Oscar time.This film is not for everyone. There are those who would dismiss this as impossibly pretentious and pointless. But for me, \"Inception\" was very stimulating and challenging -- a film well-worthy to spend two and a half hours of our valuable time. Be ready to face this challenge when you go watch it. I won\\'t be surprised if you feel you need to watch it all over again.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : 'Inception' has already been defined by its makers as a mixture of James Bond and 'The Matrix'. I was hoping that it would be more, and it was, but not as much as I would have liked it to be.Conceptually it was fascinating. Dreams are fascinating in themselves, and the idea of being able to enter and manipulate the sub-conscious has been around for awhile in movies: 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', 'Dreamscape', 'The Cell', and 'What Dreams May Come'. The best of these is 'The Cell', which spins a horrific tale. Yet, as a dream-concept film it is the most visually interesting because it gives us the kind of abstractions that are associated with dreams; abstractions that can make sub-conscious sense, particularly to the dreamer. 'Inception' initially depicts some dream abstractions, but conveniently overrides this by introducing the 'dream architect' whose job it is to make the dream as real as possible. As a result, as our actors jump through dream levels, in which there are four (psychology has determined there are primarily two sub-conscious levels) we observe commonsensical realities - for the most part. Although this is significant to storyline development, it unfortunately means that we are left with familiar visuals (chase scenes and shoot'em- ups) that merely differ from level to level. Soon we find ourselves watching two to four recognizable action scenarios that are implied to be transpiring simultaneously.Since this can present the possibility of confusion for the viewer, the film often becomes visually redundant and subsequently monotonous. This was the major flaw of the film, so much so that I almost nodded off. Myself. Yet, the concept of the film overrides this flaw, and much of the imagery is particularly stunning.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : But it's got its heart in the right place. First it's too long by at least a half-hour. Second it relies too much on frenetic activity to cover up its more grievous shortfalls. And third it's not really sci-fi, it's more a psychological thriller. But despite all that it is what it is portraying, an attempt to implant a notion, and that's highly commendable on several levels. Also a few of the scenes are both memorable and essentially flawless.The acting's all there too despite what some critics claim. DiCaprio is capable and fully invested. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is especially engaging, but the casting of Ellen Page was a near fatal mistake if you ask me. I can see why she made sense to the director and producers, but she's a drag on the movie as is Ken Watanabe who I could barely understand half the time. Still I like his acting and I can tolerate his pronunciation here. Page I don't like for some reason. Perhaps it's just too distracting and/or annoying to see her exude an almost pre-adolescent lack of experience again. If they needed an 'innocent', and I don't really agree, I would have preferred Dakota Fanning. Marion Cotillard does the exact opposite, she's worldly and knowing, but her I'd like to protect and get to know personally.I would have liked to see a slower more moody treatment of this topic. Though at least one of the chase scenes is masterful and hair-raising, the real pay dirt would have been imagining trying to enter another person's mind. In fact the separation between our minds is the bedrock on which most of our problems lay. A 'shared dream' as portrayed here would have been several notches more paradigm breaking than depicted here, I think, and that's no small flaw in this film.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Inception is a movie that works outside our logic. We feel like our mind had been played all along, it's like the movie contains some puzzling, undeciphered codes scattered all over places. The moment we walk out theater, our mind process the movie, we interpret things, looking for many many possibility of answers over the questions we've just experienced. And this is why Inception works outside our logic; because no matter how hard we think and discuss this movie, we won't go anywhere. It's a decent analogy of a tricky labyrinth.Like a discourse that some elements - I would say some key - had gone missing, or simply were not even there at the first place, Inception is a piece that Christopher Nolan as a director creates and how he wanted it to be: To create questions in our head. While I think these questions aren't supposed to be vital, but this makes Inception special on a very intriguing level. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief who works with stealing another person's mind. He used a special method by letting himself into a person's dream, hence explored those dreams while in the same time took a very important information that those persons won't share to any one. Once, a billionaire named Saito (Ken Watanabe), whom supposed to be his victim, offered Cobb a very interesting idea about doing his work differently. Instead of stealing thoughts, Saito asked Cobb to plant idea, to incept something in a person's mind. The logic is - according to this movie - if it's possible to stole any thought, it would also be possible to embed a whole new idea into a person's subconscious.To make it all happen, Cobb needs to recruit a bunch of people with their specialty. There're Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt); a guy who always worked with Cobb all the time, Adriane (Ellen Page); a brilliant architecture student whom able to create dream's environment, Yusuf (Dileep Rao); a chemist whose drugs are able to provide a powerful sedative, and Eames (Tom Hardy); a forger who stands like an actor on every person's dream. These experts has one objective: to incept an idea into one mind: Robert Fischer Jr (Cillian Murphy).The film rolls with how these experts trying to deliver this inception. Later on the movie, we would have a perception about how complex and intricate this inception method is, and how dangerous a dream could be. Apparently Cobb is keeping a dark thought on his deepest subconscious, this one includes Cobb's two children and his former beautiful wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard). Mal has been disturbing Cobb's mind, it's almost impossible to get rid of her from his dream. Every time Mal appears, his work and life are in a great danger.Without giving too many spoilers, I would continue my review concentrating on how I perceive Inception holistically. Inception goes in a way that it looks very complicated and confusing, and it'll makes us believe that we have to think hard in order to understand anything this movie delivered. While the truth is, in my opinion, Inception is a complex-looking movie with a very simple concept underneath it. The movie looks very confusing at some point, and then later on it'd become clearer, and then it looked like it's very surprising and mind blowing at the ending scene, it's something that Nolan creates on purpose so the audience would think like they'd been mind-tricked.And that preceding paragraph would come to my early statement: Inception works outside our logic. No matter how 'ambiguous' the ending is, no matter how detail the script looks like, we as an audience simply won't solve this puzzle because Nolan won't let us do so. It's impossible to conclude a research if we miss some data, so to speak. I'm not implying that Inception is a waste of time, or saying that this is a movie that doesn't have a true meaning. On a contrary, Inception is a work of genius. Instead of making a movie that goes over every one head, Christopher Nolan produced something simple that would be taken very seriously with the audience.I believe, on the first 30 minutes of Inception, lots of people are trying too hard not to get lost. While the story is going to automatically solve its puzzles on the next two hours, we as the audience is preparing ourselves hard to understand it. Once the ending came, the movie ended, we felt satisfied and intrigued. We felt smarter. We opened our interpretations, threw some insights and reasons, while the truth is actually been there all the time. I myself don't count the ending as ambiguous, since to be ambiguous the story needs to support its ambiguity. And in my opinion, while there are hints here and there, it's not enough to make it ambiguous.We don't need an extra intelligence to understand this movie. What we need is to relax, throw away our preconceptions, and let the next two and half hours entertaining you on its own tricky way.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Leonardo DiCaprio is on a \\'good movie\\' streak. The Departed 9/10, Blood Diamond 9/10, Body of Lies 8/10, Shutter Island 8/10, Inception 10/10.I went to the midnight showing of Inception at my local theater, and it was jam packed. I had been waiting for this movie ever since I saw the first preview a few months back, and now it was finally time. The lights dimmed and a wave of \"shh!\" swept through the room. I prayed silently that Inception wouldn\\'t disappoint. The movie began to play.The ocean. That\\'s the first shot of this movie, and the last thing you see before Inception literally destroys every other movie that\\'s come out in the past 10 or 15 years.Every actor in this movie is brilliant and no one is miscast. Every shot, every angle, every sequence of this movie is absolutely stellar. Every plot twist, every line of dialog is sheer genius. The pacing is perfect, and the story is destined to become a classic. Honestly, I have never been in this much awe of a film. The characters were engaging and had depth. You feel like you know each and every one of them, the suspense was awful (but in the best way possible). If I had to put the title of \\'prefect\\' on any film, Inception would be it. It is literally flawless.I have never seen a movie that actually made me sit on the edge of my seat sweating and sipping on my Coke like a nervous wreck. I have never seen a movie where I literally wanted to jump into the screen and save one of the characters, I have never seen a movie that could make me want to cry one second, shout out in anger the next, and rejoice the next. That was the power of Inception.To say that this movie was good, or even great is a enormous understatement. This move was without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen in a cinema. Quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. I am going to see it again today. I recommend you do the same.Final Word: Simply Perfect. 10/10.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : First off, this is indeed a really good movie, probably the best I have seen this year. I can\\'t wait to buy it on Bluray and watch it over and over. However, let\\'s not kid ourselves, it falls very short of masterpiece/all time classic status.When you think of this genre of movie, you can\\'t help but think of The Matrix. That was a masterpiece in my opinion. And you can\\'t help but draw comparison between these two films for many reasons, including the character of Arthur being made up to look like Neo and even having his wooden characteristics, not to mention that Arthur is in a scene obviously borrowed (cough, cough, stolen) from The Matrix\\'s subway fight scene. What I love about The Matrix is how its universe is well explained and there\\'s a solid logic behind everything. Notice I didn\\'t say \"perfect\". You can go back and watch the movie and it all ties in together nicely. On the other hand, \"Inception\" explains the rules of its universe to the audience (quite a lot in the beginning) and I kept finding myself rolling my eyes and thinking, \"that\\'s convenient\". Worst example is the \"projections\". Without these characters conveniently chasing people around, a lot of the story goes down the toilet, but the logic behind their actions is simply non existent. Another one is this whole thing about the \"kick\". Sure, gravity can wake you up from a dream. If you fall while asleep, your body will feel it and you will wake up. But please, to suggest that this concept would just magically work in a dream within a dream, within a dream is just ridiculous. There\\'s the illusion of gravity in dreams, but no actual gravity, so wtf?Then there are a lot of things not even explained. How does Cobb\\'s dad spot someone who would be able to build multi level sets in a dream really well? Why does the chemist come along in the dream? You would think a strong action type guy would greatly advance the mission more so than a geek who doesn\\'t add anything inside the dream. Why did Fischer go as far as to get training for fighting people who could invade his dreams, which means he fears his enemies, YET he has no problems getting on a ten hour plane ride BY HIMSELF!!!!! I was also bothered by two other things that do not belong in a movie that wants to be labeled as a \"classic\": 1) Ken Watanabe is a good actor, but for the love of all things holy, can someone get this guy better English tutors? His English is worst than Jackie Chan\\'s!!! You can tell he\\'s saying something extremely crucial to the plot, but you can\\'t understand any of it! 2) I know that a lot of action movies (yes, including The Matrix) take liberties with scenes featuring a shoot out. You always see the bad guys shooting away at the good guys at infinitum, yet not a single scratch on the good guys. We have now almost come to expect that in action movies, sadly. However, Inception abuses this concept beyond any reason. Bad guys empty machine guns within two feet of the good guy\\'s vehicles, you see the bullet holes everywhere, YET, not a single scratch on anyone, except for one bullet. I don\\'t mind suspension of disbelief for a good movie (which this is), but it got so bad that I was beginning to take it personal that a movie would try to insult my intelligence that much.You will have a good time watching this movie, but like they said in South Park, just because there are a lot of twists, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s intelligent, and it\\'s definitely not a masterpiece.\\n',\n",

I got uber bored and i thought most of the stuff was too predictable. People were freaking out saying this was the best film ever and it was mind-blowing and all that jazz. i FELT THERE WERE TO MANY PLOT HOLES AND GOT SICK OF THE FILM ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH. It was truly not even remotely as good as it was made out to be. 1. It wasn't as good as it was supposed to be. 2. I didn't end up liking any of the characters that much. 3.

       " \"Review of Inception : Saw it in cinemas a week after opening night or so. I couldn't keep off the 8 vote though i feel its a bit high.Short about the movie before i review it. Cobb - the main character, played by Leonardo Di Caprio, is a former architect and accused for throwing his wife out the window - literally, is trying to clean his record with the police by doing a job for a powerful acquaintance(Ken Watanabe - Saito) that involves dreamexorcism and the like. While struggling with the mystic relationship with his former wife he puts together a team of specialists to handle the job. Ellen Page plays Ariadne, the gifted young architect. Tom Hardy plays Eames, the 'impersonator' if you will. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur, in charge of the technical aspects. They are all there to trick Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) big time. By taking him through three levels of dreaming they hope to alter the very core of his motivation and change his future plans as a result. You will have the rest explained to you, don't worry about that.I've heard people saying they have to watch the movie 3-4 times before understanding the story in full. In my opinion you have almost everything explained to you just as it happens. This comes through in discussions among the characters or with the camera itself. To clarify, if you have to think about something for a moment because you didn't understand it fully the characters in the movie interrupts your thought process by explaining exactly what just happened. I don't mean to sound arrogant at all but I have this problem with movies that tries to reach out to everyone at once. If the aim is to include every watcher they obviously have to explain things over and over in different ways. I totally get that but it doesn't fit well with a movie like this one, it takes all the thought provocation and mysticism out.I don't know if it was the overall Hollywood-humorous-mood of the movie that made it difficult for me to take the characters seriously or if it was just poor portraiting from the actors. It seemed more of a kindergarten with Leonardo, the grownup, running around trying to calm down the kids - Ellen and Joseph. More of a Harry Potter cast feeling to it Im afraid. Im also disappointed to say that Leo had his worst performance in a long time, if not ever. I'd think the manuscript was aiming for a very emotionally moving struggle for the main character. However Cobbs little misadventures wasn't moving me one inch. Leos acting felt empty and almost fake.Nolan tries to feed the watcher with a bit of everything, romance, humour, action, sci-fi and psychology all at the same time but falls short in every area. The actionscenes and animations are great though, in line with almost all new movies from Hollywood these days. This to me unfortunately makes Inception more of a hardcore actionmovie than the thought provoking masterpiece I was hoping for.Now if you are one not particularly annoyed by areas discussed above you wont be disappointed with Inception, you wont be anyway. The ideas behind it are new, very interesting and thought provoking. I think people will start investigating and experimenting with their dreams just a bit more after seeing Inception.I know I do, and I like it :)\\n\",\n",

Kudos to Christopher Nolan for gifting us with the following, memento, insomnia, batman begins, the prestige, the dark knight and his best inception.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Like many people anxious to watch Inception, I spent many hours online reading news, watching trailers, and just sharing my enthusiasm about it. Then I began reading weird rumours about the film involving time travelling (it doesn't) and other potential spoilers, and I decided it was time to get away from the hubbub and wait for it in isolation. I wanted to watch the film as purely as possible. I only allowed myself one treat; I didn't resist listening to my beloved Hans Zimmer's score in advance. I never imagined my feelings about the music would reflect my feelings about the film. I expected an exquisite delicacy and instead got a steak with fries. And afterwards I was still hungry.By now word of mouth has taken all the secrecy away from the story, so let's be brief about it. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, the leader of a criminal crew that infiltrates the minds of people during their sleep to steal their ideas and sell them. After a botched assignment, Cobb and his partner, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt), are hired by Saito (Ken Watanabe) to do the reverse: instead of stealing an idea, they must implant an idea in a victim's subconscious, implant it so deeply that he won't doubt it came from himself. The victim is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the heir of an energetic mega-conglomerate that threatens to have monopoly over half the world's energy supply. The idea is to convince him to dismantle this empire. For this epic assignment Cobb hires the architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), the forger Eames (Tom Hardy) and the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao).Inception has the best ensemble cast I've seen so far this year. That doesn't mean it has the best acting – I think that honour still goes to Shutter Island, which had heartbreaking performances by Ben Kingsley and DiCaprio himself. But the viewer can be sure that a film that contains all the talent mentioned above plus Marion Cottilard plus cameos by Michael Caine, Lukas Haas, Tom Berenger and Pete Postlethwaite, is at least captivating on account of all the charisma walking in and out of the screen every two seconds.I think the film needs all this charisma to satisfy because it doesn't offer much else in terms of entertainment. One of the greatest crimes a film that takes place in dreams within dreams within dream within dreams (yes, you counted it right), can be accused of is being visually dull. Anyone who saw the trailer has nothing else to look forward to, it's all there: the zero gravity hallway fight scene, the city folding, the snow power station attack, the collapsing urban landscapes. The film only expands on the trailer, it has no other impressive scene. Any artist worth his salt only uses dreams as a theme if he wants to show something visually interesting. Dreams aren't held by physical laws; they're limitless, strange, threatening. In Christopher Nolan's world, however, I can see stranger dreams if I just look outside my window.Christopher Nolan is not a particularly inventive filmmaker. There's no visual exuberance in his films. I noticed this when he turned Gotham City, a wonderfully Gothic and oppressive landscape in the Batman comic books, into a replica of any American city. Midas' touch turns things into gold. But Nolan's touch turns uniqueness into banality. Not even dreams are safe from him. Defenders will rise to say that the realism of the dreams is the point. But then why dreams? Who makes a film about Mozart to ignore his music? Many will also say that Inception is a strange film. That's arguable, of course. It's ambiguous enough to allow several interpretations. But it makes sense most of the time. Good writing and good editing contribute to that. I think this is also what made Nolan's previous attempt at a mind-boggling film, The Prestige, so satisfying. He's a fair director. He takes time to show everything the viewer needs to know to understand what's going on, and the film's rhythm is slow. Inception is strange in the sense that other mainstream, but quirkier than average, films are called strange, like The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It's strange in a very limited way, custom-made for audiences that have been deprived of strangeness for so long that they can't recognise it anymore; it's a strangeness that hardly brings dignity to the true strangeness unleashed by Wojciech Has' The Hourglass Sanatorium or Jan Svankmajer's Faust.This banality applies even to the action. There are directors who've revolutionised the way action is filmed: John Woo, the Wachowski brothers, even Michael Bay. But Inception, with the exception of the inventive hallway fight scene, leaves much to be desired. Car chases and gun fights play out much the way we expect, with little elegance or imagination.Inception's saving grace is that, for an action thriller, the main character is far more complex and engaging than usual. Cobb is a man tormented by past horrors, separated from his children, running away for a crime he didn't commit. When he enters dreams his subconscious takes the form of his dead wife, Mal (Cottilard), always ready to foil his plans. Cobb isn't just a cool thief but a man trying to get his life back and DiCaprio makes him effortlessly sympathetic.I don't know why, but I feel bad for not liking Inception more. Cinema certainly needs ambitious films that mix intellect with action; that dare to be unique while being familiar. Inception is a respectable failure, in my view, but is a step in the right direction. I hope at least it inspires other filmmakers to move in the same direction.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Here's the rub. Although I am astounded by the layering, scene and editing logistics and other details of the movie, the experience left me underwhelmed. The are so much information to take in, more than usual for your average that while there are down times (I'll come back to this) they are not enough - and felt rush for a 2.5 hr movie. I wouldn't mind 3hr (maybe better yet as a series???! or a book even). And yet the focusing character is Cobb, a veteran of the trade, rather than the new comer - Ellen Page's character. So you must pick-up concepts like extraction, inception, dream times, totem, kicker, limbo in a hurry without laying any significant weight to these concepts. Especially in the scene on limbo? Mind you the movie repeats these to you - in earnest plot line no less.This is one information overloaded action movie, but then there's action loaded on top in the 3rd act! Which I found unnecessary or set at the wrong location as one of the character explained it. This is a concept movie, and should have stayed that way - use words, use dramatic pauses, use ideas ? Such that the sequence in discussing and finalizing the wording of the inception concept felt dry, washed over, had no sense of - achievement. -- added And I'll be darn that a friend mention this kind of plot hole : Knowing how ambiguous the ending is, but yet clearly stately throughout the first 1/2 of the film that the 'wife' character is so much of a risk. It was a wash over in the end how DiCaprio's character brushes off and not struggle a bit more ??????Thinking back, memento, prestige and dark knight in their own right were better in terms of pacing, tempo change, and focus. Although even Dark Knight had a issue of who's the lead - Batman or Joker? (But I understand the juxtapose of the 2 - starts off Bat, changed to Joker mid way, then change back?)And the back story for Cobb - kind of cliché????? You see it coming ??\\n\",\n",

My one point of criticism on an otherwise amazing movie is that he takes the concept one step too far. Towards the end keeping up with what's happening where becomes a full time task and although I don't want to come over as stupid, one less would have made the film flow much smoother.Enjoy!\\n\",\n",

I gave it 8 on 10 only because I saw it just twice.My rating might get higher on repeated viewings.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Inception Nolans latest effort is a cleverly constructed and beautifully executed sci-fi thriller, apparently he first pitched the idea to WB in 2003 and then went away to write a script he thought would be finished in a few months, 8 years later the film is released and it's no wonder it took so long to complete. The film follows Cobb (Leonadro Di Caprio), who specialises in entering people's dreams and stealing valuable secrets his employers. We open with Cobb in the mind of Saito(Ken Watanabe); a business tycoon he needs to retrieve secret documents from, but things go horribly wrong when the subconscious projection of his former wife enters the dream and betrays him. Cobb and his partner Arthur (Joseph-Gordon Levitt) are forced to flee the country as their employers will not tolerate failure, but Saito tracks them down and makes them an offer; Inception. If they can successfully plant an idea into the mind of one of Saitos competitors Saito will pull the strings necessary to grant Cobb the freedom to go back to America and see his kids again. Cobbs team is consists of Arthur, Yusuf the chemist (Dileep Rao), Eames (Tom Hardy), Adriadne the architect (Ellen Page) who is responsible for creating the dream. Nolan not only manages to create a wonderful story, but also adds his own cyberpunk dialogue to the mix. 'Riding the kick', 'Totems', 'Projections', they all add substance to the world he has created. The origins of this technology are not explored, in fact it's more of an alternate reality than a story set in the future, but it's a world constructed with such attention to detail that it feels real. What follows is a complex but not overly contrived series of dreams within dreams in order to plant the idea deep enough for it to stick. It's a mixture of theft and business espionage that provides a setting for some wonderful visuals, and in the end the only limitation is the mind of Nolan himself. One scene where Arthur is fighting off the projections of the target inside a rotating corridor is thrilling to watch in all its nauseating vertigo, whilst Cobbs training of Adriadne provide the artistic license to pull a whole host of crazy special effects. Cities bend in half, mirrors smash and turn into streets, it's a world of unlimited potential. Di Caprio once again proves that he knows how to pick a movie, his Scorsese partnership rarely disappoints, but Nolan has provided the platform for another successful performance. Joseph-Gordon Levitt is able to play his role with both suave coolness and perfectly timed comedic relief, whilst Ellen Page uses her indie image to convey a female lead devoid of the usual stereotypes. The rest of the supporting cast all do a fine job, especially Cillian Murphy as the mind-invaded and emotionally manipulated target of the Inception.After watching this film I'm still convinced Nolan boasts a flawless oeuvre, every one demonstrates a clear talent for script-writing. Insomnia may be the weakest of them all and it will come as no surprise it's the only film he had no hand in writing in. Nolan however could not resist one final teaser to the audience with Inception. As the film concludes and we are left satisfied with the arc of our protagonist, the camera pans away on to the perpetually spinning totem. As it is about to topple the film cuts away, now I don't think Nolan is seriously trying to imply that Cobb is dreaming, instead I think it's his own clever Inception. To plant an idea into the minds of the audience and watch it grow.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : And by deception rather than Inception I am referring to the title of this movie as although the film is good, it\\'s far from brilliant and I have to say I left the cinema feeling rather deceived by all of the great reviews out there from the public and critics alike who had heralded this flick a masterpiece. But a masterpiece it is not. In fact, it\\'s rather derivative from other films Christopher Nolan has directed, including Memento and The Prestige, with shades of 2001 A Space Odyssey permeating the picture as well. Now DiCaprio, of course is mesmerising as always, yet he doesn\\'t really have a lot to do as he mopes about missing his children without really expressing the distress he feels to the audience very well. Sure he anchors in the film, and in a very subtle way, but to subtle for me - almost boring subtle, which really griped me as I prefer his more flamboyant and boisterous roles. Roles he has played in films such as Shutter Island and Blood Diamond really allow him to work those acting chops of his and usually make for a very entertaining film. This film just didn\\'t let him do that. The film, although visually superior to most others out there on the market today, left me with a feeling of boredom at times and by the end I felt the pay off I had been desperately waiting for didn\\'t arrive and instead of sharing the elation of the critics and audience alike I was left with a \"O my God, was that it\" replaying in my mind. So my advice...watch this film by all means, but be warned, that although it is at times intriguing and thought provoking most of the time it\\'s meandering, plodding and ultimately quite pointless. Good but not that good. 6/10 (3*)\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : If there was ever a film to label as \"overrated\", it would be The Dark Knight. If there was ever another film to label as \"overrated\", it would be Inception. I just don\\'t understand what it is about Christopher Nolan\\'s films but they have the tendency to receive large amounts of unwarranted and undeserved praise.While they are very well-made films, they are for the most part nothing more than entertaining popcorn flicks (Memento being the one exception). Popcorn flicks of the up-most quality but nothing truly memorable or deep. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, lets get on with the review.Now, basically, Inception is a heist film with a twist. The heists take place inside of a dream, thus allowing for some creative and tricky special effects to be pulled off. These effects are pretty amusing to watch, most notably a scene where the gravity of a hallway is shifting and the two actors are duking it out amidst the gravity shifts, and this makes for some impressive-looking chaos.The story while somewhat original, wasn\\'t pulled off as smoothly as it could have been in my opinion. There were just far too many plot holes that you could drive a tank through. Now with a certain proper ending, these plot holes would diminish, but Nolan has yet to confirm just what the ending means so the plot holes are left intact. If you want a better idea of what I mean by that, PM me.Acting for the most part is good and gets the job done. Just don\\'t expect anything Oscar-caliber here. If there was one stand-out performance in Inception, I would definitely say it\\'s from Leo Dicaprio. The guy proves time and time again that he\\'s one of the better young actors working right now. The rest of the cast gives passable performances, but nothing special. Michael Caine is wasted, and I feel the only reason he was hired was to get his name on the box.Not much needs to be said about the special effects. They\\'re some of the best yet, and at times even creative. Possibly the strongest aspect of the film, next to the effects, is the musical score. Inception has one of the best scores in recent memory. My hat is off to Hans Zimmer. The effects, score, and flawed but intriguing story come together in making Inception a very enjoyable and entertaining film. It\\'s definitely smarter than your average popcorn flick, but at the end of the day it\\'s still just a popcorn flick. Nothing more, nothing less. It lacks the emotional punch and attention to detail that made District 9 so great (now that\\'s a true masterpiece, and one of the greatest sci fi films ever made).I give Inception 7.5/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun film that will also make them think a little bit.\\n',\n",

There is virtually no character devlopment the plot overly complicated and riddled with holes and contradictions.

       " 'Review of Inception : Inception is an interesting movie without a doubt (refer to one of the countless other reviews for why that is). What I am going to focus on is why I think it\\'s not a 9/10 which is what the IMDb voters on average have given it. I will also make the presumption you have seen the movie, as it\\'s not productive to repeat the plot. The second reason is because a fair amount of time has gone since I saw the movie (twice), and although that means I\\'ve had lots of time to think it through, I don\\'t remember all the details.First, let me state the most immediate reason to why I didn\\'t like the movie that much: The second half of the movie is a long string of bog standard action sequences. Yes, it\\'s trying to be tense, but it doesn\\'t manage to surprise me one bit - the ending is nearly completely predictable. Throughout, I care about only a few of the characters, and about none of the endless imaginary minions they are facing. If this fairly large flaw had been absent, the movie would at least have been a 9/10 for me.Now for the more subtle problems: I feel that not enough was done to emphasize that the mission takes place in a dream world. Most of the time, the movie\\'s \"dream\" world is indistinguishable to the real world. This similarity is intended (it is argued that the dreamer otherwise would become suspicious and wake up, or reject inception). Unfortunately, it means there are few chances to surprise us... That\\'s where we return to \"bog standard action sequences\": Sure there are a few cool twists that illustrate the characters are in a dream, like the city being turned upside down; but these devices are for the most part absent once the inception mission starts, and thus have minor impact in total.Obviously, this movie defies all physical laws, which would be okay if there is an alternative set of rules to cover for reality. It doesn\\'t have such a coherent rule set however; instead, it is mostly reminiscent of movies where anything convenient is made up for whatever is supposed to be happening on screen. The bad guys perform wildly differently depending on whether the protagonists are supposed to be able to escape or not, rules for various dream levels diverge too much, and so on. In short, the script fails to lend itself credibility - one cannot simply say \"it\\'s a dream, we don\\'t have to care about plausibility\".Aside from more than a few inconsistencies and \\'too implausible to be believable\\'-facts, is is noticeable the background story/universe is mostly invented from scratch for this film. Perhaps it would have benefited Inception if a clearer connection to some existing religious or other fantasy theme had been made. We can only speculate for now, but I do hope someone decides to make another movie with the \"entering dreams of others\" theme with stronger ties to some existing mythology.All in all, these complaints are pretty minor (except for the aforementioned way Inception attempts too much to be an action/thriller movie towards the latter parts). I\\'m giving it 7/10, since it made me stare at my watch several times to determine when I would no longer have to endure more clinical action sequences without substance.\\n',\n",

I had high expectations based on miles of positive ink from reviewers and professional critics, all tripping over themselves to bestow demigod status upon Christopher Nolan.

Now, don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m a fan of Christopher Nolan\\'s Batman reboots \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight.\" For my money, those were without a doubt the second and third most effective superhero movies to date (sorry, Raimi wins.) The man certainly knows how to keep a story moving along, and he knows how to film action. In the case of The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger provided an emotional lynchpin non-pareil in his Joker portrait, and Nolan milked it for all it was worth. There was real pathos and genuine mortal horror built into the foundation of the film\\'s impressive structure. Also, the fact that it was based on a comic book lowered the bar and allowed the audience to suspend just enough disbelief to allow most of the dorky plot elements to slip through and do their work. Now let\\'s discuss obvious comparisons to an earlier effort in this vein—that is, an action movie dolled up to the nines as philosophical treatise. I\\'ll admit that I was never a fan of The Matrix. I thought it was asinine in conception and brutish in execution, even as I admired some of the visual effects and spectacular stunt work. Comparing The Matrix\\'s ridiculous endless \"stream-of-consciousness\" gibberish about free will with, say, Roy Batty\\'s laconic final soliloquy in Blade Runner, is like comparing the Twilight series\\' moronic teen romantic angst with David Foster Wallace. Unfortunately, Inception had precisely the same effect on me, which is to say very little. Here we find the great and terrible Nolan exploring the tired territory already plundered in countless films of yore, including Hitchcock\\'s Spellbound and 1980\\'s genre pics such as Brain Storm, The Dead Zone, and Dreamscape. The basic premise reads like a dime store sci-fi novel\\'s back cover: \"In the future, we can enter into each other\\'s dreams! Feel the magic of dreams, within dreams, within dreams! Experience the thrill and wonder of miraculous \"Dream Time\\x99.\" Oh Boy!\" Within twenty minutes of the film\\'s somewhat intriguing intro, I knew not only how it would end—I also pretty much knew how we were getting there. Nolan plays primarily to the back row, and—no offense, America—but we\\'ve been slightly dumbed down over the past few decades, and we\\'re much easier as a whole to entertain than we used to be. Look back at a few films of the past with vast, labyrinthine plot structures like Hawk and Faulkner\\'s \"The Big Sleep\", or practically anything by the Coen Brothers. What\\'s defines their deep-impact gravitas, as opposed to the flat and diffuse emotional landscape of Inception? It\\'s character development, pure and simple. In this case, Nolan didn\\'t have a single character —especially the one played with typically earnest gusto by Leo Dicaprio—with a plausibly human fatal flaw, foible, or reason for doing\\x85 uh, whatever it was he was doing. We\\'re simply dropped into an alternate universe with rules seemingly invented to favor nerds of any stripe —almost impossibly similar to the one in The Matrix—and told to hold onto our hats, because here\\x85 we\\x85 go! Except we\\'re not actually GOING anywhere, or at least not anywhere we haven\\'t been a thousand times before. Sorry to rain on the parade of everyone that\\'s ready to lionize C. Nolan as the great white hope of modern blockbuster cinema, but from my vantage, there is no there there. If you want a lesson in basic existential philosophy, take a class at your local community college. You\\'ll get more out of it, and you can keep your textbook as a souvenir. If it\\'s great car chases you\\'re after, rent \"The French Connection,\" or \"Ronin.\" In other words, keep your high-octane action movie out of my high-concept art film. These are two tastes that do not go great together. Meanwhile, if Inception somehow does \"become a religion\" in another five years, than I\\'m reconsidering my continued faith in Hollywood as some kind of egalitarian oracle, where the huddled masses can go to get their myths, and feel the true power of redemption. If this is the kind of movie that will be worshipped from now on, than the god of blockbuster cinema may truly be dead.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Brilliant technical wizardry. Heady, at least apparently so. A ride more than a movie but a movie none the less. Chris Nolan is rapidly becoming the director of his generation and I\\'m longing to find out what is he trying to say. He has established his technical power again and again but if I think of \"Memento\" for instance I remember the gimmick but not what the story was really about. I suspect the same will be said of \"Inception\". I\\'m not putting down, I\\'m just wondering. I left the theater full of questions and nobody could actually give me any answers. I\\'m not talking about the plot but at the way Christopher Nolan chose to tell the story. Leonardo Di Caprio is acquiring some extra gravitas as an adult presence on the screen.Loved Cillian Murphy, I always do. Riveted by Tom Hardy. Enchanted by Marion Cotillard. Amused by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and delighted by Ellen Page. I wonder what Mr Nolan will do for an encore.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : I was keen to see this film given the high IMDb rating, as I agree with nearly all ratings I've seen on the site, but I appear to be one of the minority who think it is overrated. I couldn't emotionally engage with the characters for some reason, and so was not too concerned on the outcome for them.Whilst there were some complexities to the plot, it is reasonably easy to understand. I agree with some other comments I've seen that many characters accepted the quite fantastical premise very readily, and were prepared to place themselves at considerable risk for no real reason. So some reactions were not what you would expect for the situation.Having had time to reflect I would watch the film again, but do not think I will keep coming back to this unlike the Matrix which has a similar feel but is a much better film.\\n\",\n",

There are also fewer than you would think since the dream weavers of the story have to keep thing real in order to achieve their ends.For me the story isn\\'t much of anything,certainly not enough to support a two and a half hour tale. The deepness of Nolan\\'s \"philosophy\" is also over done, and ultimately meaningless since Nolan is on record as saying it\\'s all been made up and exists purely to drive his plot.I like the story I just wish it didn\\'t take so long to get where it was going.I also hate that Nolan changes the rules about half way in as a means of making things more exciting.

The runtime is extremely long and I found myself checking the time several times throughout the film. It was an interesting film to see, but it definitely does not belong on a list with the likes of \"Shawshank\" or \"Godfather\". The story was very confusing.There seemed to be plot holes and loose story lines that were never really tied up. The concept of the film is very intriguing and you will leave the theater wondering what it was all about. However, the atmosphere of some of the scenes felt very similar to Shutter Island for me. I almost felt like Leonardo DiCaprio did not really have to act much as he was basically playing a character similar to that of Teddy Daniels. Hope he isn\\'t going to spend the rest of his career playing that same character. It was also nice to see Ellen Page in something besides Juno. She can be more than a snarky, pregnant teenager. Also, The visual effects are extremely well-done.I am not a fan of Nolan\\'s work. The Dark Knight was a film that I could never understand why there was so much hype. It was average to me, at best. Inception, however, is much better than Memento.It is a film that you must see just because the concept is very interesting, but it is not something that you can watch over and over again.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : There is no doubt that Nolan is a very talented director, and I like a lot of his films, but sadly I think like a number of other hugely successful directors before him (Peter Jackson springs to mind) his success has led to a detrimental degree of freedom for him to churn out his own poorly-written scripts unchecked, and make films that are about an hour longer than they need to be. I know I'm swimming against the tide of public opinion here, but while I was hugely excited about seeing Inception back when it came out, I was absolutely crushed on first viewing. I found it terribly written (the film begins with enough exposition scenes to fill a normal film's running time!), incomprehensible (editing was all over the place, action dull and repetitive), visually disappointing (all the best bits were revealed in the trailer and were all contained in the exposition scenes rather than having anything to do with the story) and with a concept that just didn't hold water (the dream sequences seemed to always resemble Matrix out-takes and were held together by a logic that just wasn't very dream-like)!Perhaps if Nolan had a studio breathing down his neck and someone to revise his shaky script this could have turned out well, but after the success of TDK he can effectively write his own ticket and is (sadly) free to churn out this kind of lazy and self-indulgent snooze-fest. The same thing happened with Peter Jackson after LOTR with King Kong (an hour too long, too much freedom etc.)Hans Zimmer's incredible score was about the only positive I took out of Inception (Zimmer's brilliant scores are increasingly the glue that holds Nolan's films together and makes them seem better than they are). Despite his obvious talents and love of film (I love him for shooting Batman stuff in IMAX 70mm!) Nolan has some very bad habits (mainly relying on his and his brother's writing) which I think really hamper his films these days. I loved TDK, but it frustrates me in almost equal measure, and though I haven't seen The Dark Knight Rises yet, I will go in with very low expectations based on his apparently dwindling form.\\n\",\n",

It's not all that.My biggest problem was that they couldn't get me to care about the relationship between Leonardo DiCaprio, his wife and his child, which was suppose to be Dom Cobb(DiCaprio character) biggest motivation. I could care less for any of the characters, I wasn't emotionally invested at all.This isn't the first time Christopher Nolan tried to take Film Art concepts and commercialize it. This is an attempt at making a surrealism commercial. The problem with trying to make a surreal movie for the general public is that you have to make it understandable to the masses. The dreams in the movie was too orderly. Surrealist films like, Un Chien Andalou, are chaotic like dreams.Big visuals and action sequences aren't enough anymore, if you can't get me care about what drives the story, you're going to lose me.\\n\",\n",

But thats OK, I don't think it would be possible to make such a movie under 400 million and in such a small production time that it was made, so for the effort that Nolan had done - A GREAT MOVIE, just not what i expected. The plot wasn't stupendously simple, it was quite intriguing, but way too explanatory, I can't imagine what went on Noaln's mind when he thought of a dream within a dream, that wasn't a particularly smart move.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Well, I didn't think it lived up to all the hype, but nonetheless it was still a pretty good film. I don't think the story came out quite the way Nolan had hoped, after working on it for over a decade. In my view the story is basically a combination of Vanilla Sky meets The Matrix, but really it ends up being less meaningful than both (A combination of the mystical waking dream and the matrix of consciousness). This is Nolan's version of Edgar Allan Poe's A Dream Within A Dream, or the like. However I don't think the film really comes across this way as well as it should, or especially, the way it was meant to.Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem that my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown away in a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! Can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! Can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream? The film overall feels forced and clunky, it lacks any kind of good rhythm. For me to see this film ranked in the top 15 films ever made according to the IMDb voters only goes to prove one thing; The IMDb top 250 list is good for nothing at all but a laugh. I thought Inception was pretty good. However pretty good is stretching it as far as I would ever go. This film is a long long way from great.7/10\\n\",\n",

It is always a risk to watch something that has been hyped up to be an intellectual masterpiece....because generally nothing will live up to your expectations.As others have stated, the ending was predictable, and several plot and dialogue elements seemed too contrived and banal. But for all that, it was a creative and entertaining thriller.Personally, I thought Blade Runner was more thought provoking and Memento more innovative.Maybe the problem is that I have seen so many of the movies from which this film seems to draw inspiration that Inception did not strike me as terribly original or thought provoking.Anyway, it was entertaining. Definitely worth a watch.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : I heard a number of great things about Inception, including from my sister who came out saying it was one of the cleverest and best movies she'd seen. After seeing it for myself, I thought it was a good film, but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen, Inception didn't wow me as much as Memento and The Prestige, and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that mean the film is bad? No, I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan's best as I have heard people say.My main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment, I do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold. Particularly in the characters, they are written and acted well, but not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments. I loved the idea of the story, it was clever and somewhat original and it did start very compelling and intriguing, but as the film progresses it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little interest. Also, the pace is uneven, as the characters became more cold and the story more convoluted, the film really does start to drag until the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.Inception despite these faults does have a number of strengths, especially the beautifully crafted production values, dream sequences and effects and Nolan's superb direction. Hans Zimmer's score is incredibly good too, while powerful and haunting it rarely becomes overbearing, while the dialogue is on the whole clever and thought-provoking. The acting is generally very good, both Leonardo DiCaprio, with a more hardened persona which has grown even more, and Ellen Page give strong performances and while Marion Cotillard is underused she is pretty good as well and Cillian Murphy I think gives the best supporting performance as he is superb.Overall, Inception is a generally good film but not as good as it is lauded to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox\\n\",\n",

Besides being accompanied by a score determined to set you to sleep there's really no filmmaking here that sets it above the rest.The plot is very interesting and, for the most part, well conceived. However, the characters do too much talking simply explaining to the audience what the meaning of their actions are. Why assume the audience is inept?The basis of the plot itself is where film most earns its grade. This is truly a unique idea for the screen. Unfortunately, it was denigrated by the unnecessary dumbing down of the story and the unimpressive acting of the cast.No matter what the subject of a movie, to end it with the question of whether it was all a dream or not is not clever.\\n\",\n",

I won\\'t bother with the whole plot line, since it\\'s very sprawling and complicated, but suffice it to say that my main disappointment with the film stems from the fact that the thematics of the story simply are too limited and ordinary compared to the potential impact of the film\\'s gimmick: the fact that you can enter somebody\\'s dream to steal information or plant ideas.The plot revolves mainly around industrial espionage, a theme which simply does nothing for me emotionally. Who cares if one industrial tycoon wants to stop another? The dream concept of the film is truly magical and innovative and is a very compelling feature of the film itself. But why in heaven\\'s name marry it to something as pointless as industrial espionage? What happened to something like the fight for world domination? It would have given the film infinitely more punch if the plot had centered around some political intrigue in stead. Especially given the unstable nature of the world today with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, huge climate issues, and so forth.The subplot involving Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard\\'s characters to me comes off very flat, their on screen chemistry not being very strong. This is a shame, for the premise of the subplot has great emotional potential.All in all, somewhat of a disappointment, despite the wallop one inevitably receives from the film\\'s take on the concept of entering someone else\\'s dreams.\\n',\n",

       " 'Review of Inception : Where should I start? It would be better to get straight to the point. Firstly, despite the idea is brilliant, in other words, generally the story of the movie is brilliant, ideas don\\'t make a movie great as just complicatedness doesn\\'t make a movie good. By this movie, personally, I have understood that Nolan is not \"my director\". The Dark Knight was also a serious disappointment for me and Batman Begins was just a summer blockbuster (Following and Prestige were very very good) As for Inception, the biggest flaw of the movie is the movie is lack of heart and soul, in other words, it is cold. The characters are cold, the atmosphere is cold, the reactions are cold, because they are in dream? Well, I don\\'t think so. It causes what then? I didn\\'t much care about the intrigue, couldn\\'t identify with the characters, so the most important problem of the movie is its dramatic structure. The second is the \"dreams\" itself. You know, the agent of dreams in cinema is David Lynch. Why? Because he shoots creative, intriguing, sometimes meaningless as it should be and surreal dream sequences. The dream sequences in Inception can only impress the architects, mathematicians and some businessmen (because there are a lot of men in black suit) It is because like his approach towards Batman, he sticks to reality. Despite the visual effects are jaw dropping, \"the street bending\" scene is my favorite, it doesn\\'t help much. By the way, honestly, I couldn\\'t understand the trick of Ariadne, for example, is it planned or impromptu? If the point is impressiveness, well I was much more impressed by Sucker Punch for example which has been exposed to harsh reviews. The movie also has not any dramatic twist, epic scene (except for a few moments) or real mystery which had been all necessary in my opinion. Can we say that the movie was low key? Thirdly, some, may be many action scenes seem pointless and ineffective. Especially the \"snow\" sequence. It was too long without real entertainment or excitement. There is not any problem with the cast (except the fact that in contrast with the majority, I think that Leonardo Di Caprio\\'s performance in this movie was just good, not his best performance so far, it is nothing, for example in comparison with What\\'s eating Gilbert Grape!), but it is a bit disappointing that Nolan often uses the same actors in his movies. A note: Michael Caine\\'s character might be a tribute for his character in Children of Men. If you ask me, the best part of the movie is the \"train scene\" It was the only scene that I was dramatically involved and got excited. The \"gravity\" sequence was just interesting. I didn\\'t find it epic. Finally, about the plot, I didn\\'t find the starting point creative, brilliant or exciting. I mean the concept of choosing a businessman for inception, weren\\'t there better options? In other words, the main story was too poor for the concept. However, if we consider Nolan\\'s style, to tell a story about the world of business, might be exciting for him. However, if we consider the hype, the rating, the reviews etc. it seems that Mr. Nolan has deluded audiences again or we have been incepted.\\n',\n",

Nolan is a director who can come up with really cool concepts, and use them to make really cool films. Thanks to his Batman success he had been entrusted with a much larger budget to put behind one of his ideas. You can see where the money has gone. His interesting ideas are perfectly visualised on screen, there are a lot of really cool visual moments.The issue with Inception is the idea itself. The film is not half as clever as it thinks it is, and there are a lot of little niggles and plot holes that have to be glossed over in order for the film to hold together at all. Only two characters get any real development at all, the rest are there only for the various reasons that the plot needs them there for. Hardy is enjoyable, and Levitt has a few good moments, but in general these side characters aren't engaging at all.I must say, I loved the ending, and found it quite challenging. It was really the only time the film actually made me properly think in an interested way rather than an annoyed or confused way.Compare this to other blockbusters, it has to be commended for at least an attempt at an interesting concept and trying to make you think. I don't think it's particularly successful at either. Compare this to Memento, and it's clear Memento is the better film, with a more interesting plot and more rousing feel.\\n\",\n",

Christopher Nolan took charge of the script and direction.It is undoubtedly an interesting, intellectually challenging and well-crafted film. The rich and intricate script gives us a solid, well-imagined story with good characters (the two main characters, attributed to DiCaprio and Watanabe, are even more worked and function as antagonists). Despite this, the contained and reserved form as the characters demonstrate emotions makes the movie a bit cold from the emotional point of view. The emotions are there, they just prefer to demonstrate them in a discreet way. The script could have even explored the emotional and psychological consequences of stealing ideas, for the thief and for those who are robbed, but prefers to remain in the realm of material consequences. The end of the film is good but, from a certain moment, it becomes slow and predictable. Despite this, praise is given to the performance of Nolan as well as the main actors. DiCaprio fulfilled our expectations, Ellen Page was a pleasant surprise and the rest of the cast was up to the challenge.Although not a perfect movie, there is no doubt that it is good. It's a movie that will be more pleasing to the more intellectual, audiences who do not like movies where thinking is needed to understand it will probably have more difficulty in enjoying it.\\n\",\n",

Not quite, due to some \"can\\'t quite put my finger on it\" lack of overall execution.For a basic plot summary, \"Inception\" deals in the world of shared dreams, in which individuals (while asleep) can enter the dream of another and insert/extract information. When an \"inception\" team (led by Leonardo DiCaprio) is put together for an especially difficult assignment, they must go deeper into the mark\\'s head than ever before.In terms of grandiose ideas, \"Inception\" is truly a mind-boggling concept that will intrigue you right from the get-go.

I was impressed. I was interested. But I was never really involved. Concerned that I may have been too obtuse to have taken in this film properly, I set out to learn a bit more about Nolan and Inception. From Wikipedia, I learned that \"Nolan\\'s films are typically rooted in epistemological and metaphysical themes, exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity.\" Wow. If I hadn\\'t dropped out of my first year philosophy course, I might have been better able to enjoy this film. At least I wouldn\\'t have had to look up epistemological (\"having to do with the theory of knowledge,\" in case you were wondering). Okay, so I guess Inception may be all of those things, but as The New Yorker\\'s David Denby points out in his review of the film, \"There\\'s no spiritual meaning or social resonance to any of this\" (New Yorker July 26, 2010 issue).

Nice guy! Also, he is in exile. He sorely misses his young son and daughter, whose mirages we see many times throughout the movie, but only from behind, never glimpsing their faces. Poor Dom can not be reunited with his children in America because he is a wanted man there, accused of the murder of his wife Mal. Is the charge justified?

Doing so will secure a safe passage to the U.S., provided as payment by his latest employer Saito (Ken Watanabe), a greedy Japanese energy tycoon. Instead of adventures on the high seas, Dominic\\'s adventures take place in a multi-layered dreamworld. His mission this time is a little different. Instead of extracting information he must plant an idea in his wealthy target\\'s mind. That\\'s called \"inception.\" If successful, this will make his already super rich employer Saito become obscenely rich (what a great cause!). In order to build this maze-like dreamworld, making it safe and impervious to invasion from unwanted forces such as the lingering ghost of Mal (like in malware--get it?), he enlists the aid of a really smart young lady. In keeping with Nolan\\'s habit of giving his female characters stupidly obvious names, he calls her Ariadne (Ellen Page), a reference to the mythical Greek daughter of King Minos who helped Theseus escape the maze of the man-eating Minotaur to whom he was sacrificed. I believe this is what we call \"intertextual\" storytelling. It\\'s meant to enrich the meaning of the story by drawing in archetypal stories and themes to add depth.

Instead, the dream landscapes are there to accommodate a handful of action movie setpieces. They are visually stunning setpieces to be sure. In particular, the gravity defying fight scene in a hotel corridor, in which people's bodies are pulled toward constantly shifting centers of gravity, to match a parallel tumble off a bridge in which the bodies of the sleeping dreamers within the dream are plummeting through space in a van. It is a remarkable achievement. However, it is not the stuff of dreams. Dreams are eery and psychologically unsettling. They express buried fears and longings while hinting at the existence of awe-inspiring supernatural forces. And quite often, the locations are spare and minimal. Great filmmakers like Federico Fellini and David Lynch filmed dream sequences that left viewers with gooseflesh, and they did so by fiddling with combinations of settings and sounds usually in spare surroundings. They did so by tugging at the viewer's empathic sense of kinship with the character, and sparking a commingled sense of attraction and dread to the dream narrative. Films can only achieve this effect of heightened emotion and involvement when there is something at stake, something that the viewer cares about. Regrettably, I didn't care about anybody or any outcome in Inception. Will one multinational corporation surpass the other in wealth? Who cares? Will the morally shady Dominic be reunited with his kids? I don't care that much because he's an emotionally closed character. Will Christopher Nolan tie up all the loose ends in his high tech mental thriller? I suppose he did but, again, I didn't care.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Inception reminds me of another film in which the main character yearns to return home, The Wizard of Oz. But unlike that film, it is all brains and no heart. Nolan needs to find the courage to admit he is wanting as a complete filmmaker and change his game to reflect the maxim that I learned when I entered teacher\\'s college: \"No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : I cannot ignore facts. I cannot ignore mistakes and plot holes, bad writing, or bad marketing. I cannot ignore hype, especially when it\\'s already on the IMDb top 250, it received praise from critics, cashed in a lot of money, and people call it stunning and unforgettable. The simple truth is that Inception does not live up to the hype. Let me start with the trailer. All the coolest things (the folding city, the collapsing cliffs, the train in the street) are totally unessential to the plot. None of that takes more than a few seconds. So why did they put them on all the posters as well? Nevermind. I\\'ll move on to the real problems of the movie.So I heard all these people saying how complex the movie is. How I\\'ll need to watch it twice. How the shocking ending will blow my mind. I knew exactly what that \"shocking ending\" would be half way through the film. The very last paragraph of this review deals with the ending. It\\'s not exactly a spoiler but you can skip it if you don\\'t want to know anything.Cobb (DiCaprio) takes on a mission to implant a thought into Fischer\\'s (Murphy) mind. As a reward, his contractor Saito (Watanabe) will clean his record with the LAPD. Cobb is wanted for the murder of his wife and consequently he can\\'t return to USA and see his children. Throughout the movie, this is Cobb\\'s main inner conflict, that before he fled the country, he didn\\'t get a chance to see the kids\\' faces and he wants to see them again. Michael Cain has a very small role as their grandpa and DiCaprio\\'s father-in-law. Why doesn\\'t Cain take the kids someplace so they could be with their father? People move all the time. Or why doesn\\'t he send Cobb some home movies if he wants to see their faces so much? They could even have video calls and all that stuff. It\\'s a long distance relationship but it\\'s something. Well, apparently no one thought of that, and so the main character\\'s main motivation for his actions makes no sense. As for acting, DiCaprio was good. But if you\\'ve seen Shutter Island, You\\'ve seen a third of Inception. Dead wife, small kids, a sense of loss, a pretty wooden house in a field, all those flashbacks Teddy had in Shutter Island\\x85 it\\'s all in Inception. Minus the funny Boston accent.The mission these mind thieves embark on is to plant an idea into a rich guy\\'s mind. This is called inception. Hence the title, I guess. Everyone says it\\'s impossible to do, so you know they are going to succeed in the end. Inception is essentially a heist movie, but instead of getting into a vault, Cobb\\'s team has to get inside someone\\'s mind – which happens to look like a vault. The supposed complexity of the movie boils down to the idea of a dream within a dream. Basically, imagine that once you are plugged inside the matrix, you plug yourself into yet another, deeper, matrix. There, I just explained the super complex plot of the movie. But in case that wasn\\'t enough, there is Ellen page\\'s character, Ariadne. She is the obligatory new member of the team that is introduced to represent the audience and their questions. I\\'m fine with that. Every movie has one of those uninitiated people. The thing is, she understands everything too quickly and becomes suddenly becomes the most competent character. Pretty convenient, if you ask me.Let me finally get to the mission. It\\'s the worst part of the movie. Watanabe wants Murphy, who just inherited a huge corporation, to dissolve it, because it was going to become a huge monopoly. So Watanabe hires DiCaprio to plant the idea of splitting the company in Murphy\\'s mind. And so they do that. For two and a half hours. But I don\\'t care if he splits the big company or not. Why should I care if Murphy has a bigger company than Watanabe? The stakes of the movie aren\\'t high, they are nonexistent. I am not given any reason to care about whether or not they succeed. I\\'m only given more and more action set pieces to look forward to, and a lot of cool slow motion and zero gravity fights reminiscent of The Matrix, but I\\'m not given any reason to care for what is happening. I liked Watanabe\\'s character only because I like Ken Watanbe. As for Saito himself, I don\\'t give a damn if his competitor destroys his company or not. They don\\'t tell us what consequences it would have, they don\\'t show us what happens with the company, they don\\'t do anything with this initial idea. Which is strange, because the movie is all about ideas being important. Okay, so I didn\\'t like the plot and the acting was nothing new. What about the rest? Hans Zimmer\\'s unremarkable score works well with the scenes but it would be super boring to hear on its own. The visual effects are good but since all the coolest city-folding scenes were so short, there wasn\\'t really that much to do. The zero gravity stuff was done well, I\\'ll give them that. Cinematography was good, bordering on too much shaky camera.Here\\'s the paragraph about the ending:The big ending is that you are supposed to be unsure what was a dream and what was reality. If it was real, then it\\'s stupid because DiCaprio had dozens of ways to be with his kids without making things so incredibly complicated. The movie is supposed to make you think, but if you think about it the whole plot falls apart. If it was a dream, then it\\'s a stupid cop out on Nolan\\'s part. An excuse for all the things that didn\\'t make sense. It was all a dream, so screw you, audience.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : I couldn\\'t agree with Kimba more. There is nothing to this film other than the special effects and crappy action sequences. The obvious story line is just as simple as the story in the Matrix and was hijacked form the same philosophy books that have been around for thousands of years.What They Wanted You To See: The special effects are very well done but reminded me of when I was thirteen and learned how to bend corners in photo-shop, for the next three month any picture I created in photo-shop had all the corners bent, I was so excited to show off my newly acquired skill. Same thing with the special effects in this film. How many times do I need to see Gordon- Levitt running, fighting and falling against the walls and ceilings in the hotel room scene? How many times do I have to see the buildings crumble and the van falling in slow motion. I get it, I get it, they figured out how to do this and they are excited to show it off. Great special effects, I would have been in awe regardless of what the plot line was...Just for me the quality of a good movie is one which you enjoyed and would love to see again. Although this movie does inspire some non-independent thinking and conversation; what I am hearing about this film is that many walked out without understanding it, by their own admission, and have no intention of seeing it again. If I saw this movie being played on cable I would flip the channel so fast it would make my TV smoke. But with that said, this will be another cult movie with the same old cult following, bah bah...You Do Not See This Because You Are Not Aware That You Are Dreaming A Dream Within A Dream: Here is the great part. The movie has a secondary plot line. Forget the whole dream idea and whether he is or he is not in a dream and who\\'s dream he is in and why the kids are in the precisely same position, age and outfits in the last scene as they are in DiCaprio\\'s previous recollections. Apparently the character of Leonardo DiCaprio is based on Nolan; the director. The film is about making a movie. DiCaprio is the director, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the producer, Ellen Page is the screenwriter, Tom Hardy is the actor, Dileep Rao is the technical guy, Ken Watanabe is the money man behind the movie and Cillian Murphy is the audience.Do You Hear The Music?: The whole movie is explaining to the audience and the staff that you must create a semi believable world for the victim, the mark, the audience to be drawn in to. Its about scouting a location, creating a world and getting the audience lost in it, giving the director enough time to plant a non-original idea, such as, \"What a great movie this was!\" Anyone feel sorry for Cillian Murphy / Robert Fisher, Jr. because he was getting screwed with? well thats not Murphy that was getting screwed with, its all of us!Is Your Inner Ear Intact After All That Imax Noise, Because Here Comes Your Kick: According to DiCaprio\\'s character or Nolan, If you alter the dream world too much, like Ellen Page did in DiCaprio\\'s dream, the victim\\'s/audience\\'s subconscious will turn on you, realizing its fake/ a dream, and will turn on the manipulator of the dream, thus the screenwriter, director, etc. and become disengaged from the film/dream and wake-up, \"good afternoon, I am glad to see that you are awake.\"Do You Remember Any Of It?: Do you remember when the original \"Architect\" gets killed off in the beginning? Well apparently it is very common in the movie industry to replace/remove the first screen writer. If you watch some of the interviews with DeCaprio he says that he is studying Noal for his character in the film, now you know why.Now, wipe off the morning-glory from your eyes and go outside and play.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : The film is a disappointment, because it did so little with so much. Basically what you have here is a very interesting sci-fi heist premise; Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are partners who use dream-invasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers (why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit, is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise) while they doze. In exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against Cobb, they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission: to practice \"inception\" on a powerful business scion, that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulation.All of this is great, but unfortunately none of it has any emotional weight. To find that we have to look into the mystery of why Cobb has been in exile, and this plot has to do with his wife (Marion Cotillard) with whom he shared a disastrous and traumatic experience of dream sharing. This is to me where the movie essentially falls apart. It seems like Nolan and the other writers never fully synthesized these two dominant strains in the film, so that most of the time the emotional drama is just getting in the way of the heist film or vice a versa. At no point did it seem to me that the heist was complimenting the drama or vice a versa. And in fact after some very impressive effects sequences during the scenes where Cobb shows his new assistant Ariadne (Ellen Page, too green to hold up her role) a lot of the action becomes outright tedious, never more so than when we\\'re \"treated\" to about a reel or ten minutes of numbing snow-mobile and gunfight action, right at the point where the film should be reaching a climax. It all starts to feel very obligatory, and Nolan is not a good enough action director to make empty content feel like fun.As a basic action/heist movie with sci-fi premise, it still works well enough that I would recommend it as a rental. Nolan works in some of the elements that have made some of his better films work on a higher level, such as the association with totems and icons (the spinning wheel, etc.) and the connection between memory or memory devices and identity. However when all the pieces are laid out, the film seems overly simple and mechanical. The plot is just this -- the guy takes a job, he does the job, he gets to re-unite with his kids. Although he constantly mopes about in a depression because he tried inception on his wife and she died, he has no ethical or moral problem with doing the same thing to Cillian Murphy\\'s character, even though nobody knows the real consequences that could befall or the true motives of Ken Watanabe\\'s character. I was hoping that some larger picture would emerge, but instead this film is politically naive and instead attempts to be dramatic. The constant shots of adorable children playing on the lawn made me feel I was watching a bad Spielberg film. The entire emotional anchor of the film is put on the shoulders of these cute kiddies in true Spielberg fashion. If you don\\'t buy into this ridiculous soft-target hook, then the whole film collapses like DiCaprio\\'s dream world.This isn\\'t a bad or stupid film, but after a while you start to yearn for at least some human warmth or humor, which is almost always missing from Nolan\\'s films. The characters are so sincere that it starts to become suffocating, especially considering how ridiculous the premise is when taken seriously. Basically this is like \"Total Recall\" in terms of ideas and in terms of stupid action scenes, except that it takes itself hugely seriously. It does not become a better film by doing so, nor a more intelligent one.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Inception is one of those movies that \"engaged\" film-goers will mistake for genius. Let me explain my theory on people and movies. There are three types of movie-watchers: passive, engaged, and intelligently engaged. Passive people will watch Die Another Day and like it just as much as the Bourne Identity. They don\\'t go to the movies to think, they go to be entertained by cool effects and witty one-liners. Engaged people think they know what they\\'re talking about, and generally love movies that are edgy in plot and execution but conventional enough to understand, like Fight Club and the subject of this review. They believe themselves to be refined in cinema, but, in reality, just don\\'t quite have the intellect, cinematically speaking, to pull it off. Intelligently engaged people will appreciate the complexity of Inception, but also recognize it\\'s a little sloppy, self-serious, over drawn, and empty. They recognize its audacity, but don\\'t pretend like it is Kubrick or Paul Thomas Anderson. Suffice it to say, most people who fall into the engaged category will try and pretend that Inception is a \\'masterpiece\\' and that they know everything about movies. They don\\'t. Inception is clever, but it doesn\\'t rank anything above respectable.The premise is ingenious, and Inception is able to live off its sheer mind-bendiness for the first 45 minutes. Leo is a specialist at entering people\\'s minds through their dreams and extracting, or in this case, planting information. The dream world Nolan creates is so exciting and unpredictable that the audience, me included, couldn\\'t care less about the actual story line. Unfortunately, when the magic wears off and the extravagantly overlong climax starts (almost at the midway point), things fall apart.The first problem is the eventual goal of the whole operation is seriously anti-climactic. As far as I could tell, they\\'re trying to break up some obscure monopolistic multi-national company for a rich CEO, who in turn will give them large sums of money and Leo a way back to his kids. Sound under-developed? It is. Nolan never really fleshes it out. He is too busy creating spectacularly slick effects to get caught up in silly things like crucial plot points.When Inception hits its final profligate culmination (the climax inside the climax), I couldn\\'t help but notice how empty it all was. Nolan makes the mistake of thinking multiple things happening at once equals suspense. In an effort to ratchet up the intensity, Nolan piles on at least 5 simultaneous plot-lines that climax at the same time. All this serves to do is suffocate the little suspense that had been built up. There is literally a fifteen minute stretch where Hans Zimmer\\'s deafening score blares and Nolan annoyingly flips through the parallel actions like an ADD-afflicted friend who can\\'t decide what channel to watch. It\\'s mind- numbing, not to mention confusing as hell. One of these little subplots is particularly ridiculous and consists of a guy running around a snowbound bunker shooting people for the whole 15 minutes. Cutting-edge techno thriller? At this point, I was thinking more along the lines of a Roger Moore Bond flick.For all its structural faults, the single most damning aspect of Inception is its complete lack of heart or emotion. The one remotely human thread in the film deals with Leo and his mysterious dead wife. This thread is drawn out to excess and becomes more and more incomprehensible as the movie progresses. Inception seems to delight in keeping the audience in the dark regarding if Leo\\'s wife is real or just a projection of his subconscious. Inception thinks it\\'s awfully clever, but it\\'s hard to feel emotion towards characters that you\\'re not even sure exist. Near the end, I found the dialog between the unhappy couple completely devoid of meaning, made worse by Nolan attempting to give it resonance through close ups of people crying and a climaxing score. Despite the fact that the majority of this review deals with Inception\\'s shortcomings, I actually like the movie as a whole. For all of its faults, I was grudgingly won over through Inception\\'s pure style and visceral power. Nolan occasionally strikes brilliance, especially in an early scene where a dream explodes around Ellen and Leo in slow-motion virtuosity. This movie is not the genius many will claim, but it\\'s not so bad either. Give it a shot, just don\\'t expect to dream about it afterwards.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : I\\'m not even going to waste my time writing a review, it would get lost in the \"dream world\" of positive reviews. Those who are making this out to be something profound or mind-boggling are also delusional.All it is is a muddy film with tons of plot holes and slightly better-than-average special effects. I am completely amazed at the comments about this being something more than it is. \"The Matrix\" was far, far better, made far more sense and offered far more insight into human nature, love, etc.Nolan has made a \"cluster f__k\" that must have subliminally messaging going on in some theaters cuz nobody in our theater enjoyed it very much. The acting is superb. There\\'s one really cool scene of Paris defying gravity. Other than that there is nothing new and there is little or no logical plot line. It is just as my title says, convoluted. I\\'m a writer and this is the kind of stuff I delete from my novels when I begin to stray or run on.There\\'s one review here that understands what is going on with the people who have fallen for this nightmare... he says \"There are movies for stupid people. There are movies for smart people. Then there are movies for people who like to think they\\'re smart.\" He has hit the proverbial nail on the head. This is a movie a few, likely stoned college fanboys go to see, start a conversation about \"what if...\" and create something out of nothing. Any intelligent person begins to have serious trouble coming up with answers that truly fit the massive questions in Nolan\\'s script. To pass it off as \"well, it\\'s all a dream\" is just a cop out. The movie doesn\\'t really work. The dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream is just a way for him to cover his mistakes.This movie deserves a high 7 at best. In time, it will drop considerably on this site... perhaps to near #100. But that will only be due to Nolan fans. True movie buffs will never fall for this fantasy. It\\'s ordinary storytelling and a \"make-it-up-as-you-go-along\" script.Go back to schools everyone. Stop doing drugs. This is not a fine wine... it is carbonated fruit punch. And your drooling all over your shirt!\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Why are people going mental over this Matrix/Paprika wannabe? It's undeservingly credited for way to many things. Maybe I'm being too harsh since it's the best blockbuster in the last two years, but lets be honest. The first half of the movie is drowning in clichés and the rule 'show, don't tell' is not being utilized at all. Am I the only one who finds those tedious dialogues when they explain the whole plot (as if we were ten year olds) - really annoying? The real people in those situations would talk and react completely differently. That makes the character interactions and conversations barely believable and just empty.Also, actors who play Saito and Mal are really destroying any credibility of the drama and tension movie has. Saito (besides being a Morpheus wannabe) always talks as if he was simply happy he remembered the lines. And why, oh why do they have such unnatural, bad and forced accents? Ellen Page was a bad choice too (another cliché - younger student learns everything sensei has to say in 2 min and then teaches HIM a lesson). DiCaprio wasted his talent here, his powerful acting was ruined by the forced tension of the movie and a lousy soundtrack (which apparently never stops).The second half of the movie was better and combined with the end gave a certain satisfaction in terms of mental food. Nolan really is a master of plot and king of moments - unfortunately this is obviously becoming his biggest weakness. The overall impression is: it could have been a LOT better. It's not awful, but giving it a 10 and calling it a benchmark is just ridiculous.\\n\",\n",

Normally when I sit down and watch a movie I like to relax on my couch and will probably check me phone in the beginning until it reall catches my attention. With this movie you can't do that. You need to fully pay attention and it lowkey felt like I was forced to watch it because of how much focus you need to watch this film. I feel like a great movie shouldn't be that hard to watch.

       " \"Review of Inception : I'll be the first one to admit that INCEPTION is the kind of thinking man's thriller that has something going on every second of its two-hour and 28 minute running time. But only director Chris Nolan knows what it's all about and I don't believe I'll find out all the explanations until I get the DVD commentary.It's a heady mixture of sci-fi, comic book stuff and fantasy and all of it is focused on the mastery of dream invasion in order to gather secrets held in the human mind. Foremost among the players is LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, playing his role in a very authoritative manner with no shortage of barking orders and furrowed brow, all highly intense, as he gathers a team around him to investigate the dreamscape.There's plenty of action along the way, interspersed with quieter moments of explanatory dialog so the audience has at least some semblance of what's going on. But the whole concept of the story lacks the kind of credibility that would have made the film more engaging than it really is.Credit the actors with doing their best despite the fact that none of them have roles that are fully fleshed out. And this includes Joseph GORDON-LEVITT, ELLEN PAGE, TOM HARDY, CILLIAN MURPHY, KEN WATANABE and TOM BERENGER.If you're a MATRIX fan, you'll love this one. If not, you may wonder what all the fuss was about.Frankly, I had more fun exploring dream invasion in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, less intellectual but a lot more fun.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Christopher Nolan's sci-fi thriller might well have been called 'Deception', or better still, 'Multiple Deception', such is the effect the film has. The concept is original, no question. However, it does borrow from classic American films such as 'Citizen Kane' and 'The Matrix'.Many film geeks – and ordinary punters – have described this film as 'very complicated'. The truth is it's just tremendously detailed. For his job, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), while in a dream state, steals ideas from people ('Extraction'); however, the film concerns itself with him implanting an idea into a person's mind, i.e. 'Inception'. That's the plot in one crude line.However, to reduce the plot, which took a modern master nearly eight years to flesh out, to one purely about mental thievery would be unfair. It is the minutiae which are meant to dazzle.Business tycoon, Saito (Ken Watanabe) needs Cobb to perform the inchoate process of Inception on another businessman's son, Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), to prevent his father's energy company from becoming a monopoly. After Fischer Snr passes, it is believed that he will betroth the business to his son, so the idea Cobb and his team must implant is for him to repudiate his father's will.The technology used to carry out the subconscious subterfuge is never explained. When we catch glimpses of it, it looks like a child's primitive science-kit thrown into a briefcase. But this is not meant to be the focus.For all its cerebral conceit, at the film's core are two emotional stories. One is of Cobb's wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who spends her time stalking Cobb's subconscious mind and thereby sabotaging his missions. The other is between Fischer and his father, whose relationship is strained.We saw DiCaprio mature in Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed'. Here he permanently loses the schoolboy image and becomes a man. The ensemble acting is good, however, most of the main characters seem far too young to do anything let alone steal and implant ideas, and Michael Caine's turn as yet another sage is fast becoming trite.The computer-generated imagery is, as expected, top-notch, though the action scenes would be clichéd if they were not embellished by Hans Zimmer's superbly suspenseful music.Ultimately, Nolan asks us to absorb too much gobbledegook too quickly. Perhaps he was being pretentious, perhaps not. Either way, I lost interest somewhere in the second half.Within days of the film's release, thousands of cinema-goers cast their votes on this venerated website, ensuring that the film became, at least in their minds, one of the top five greatest films of all time. So much for polls.www.scottishreview.net\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Read the films ranked below Inception in the top 250...and weep. Have people lost their critical faculties? Yes, Inception is clever, multi-layered, complex and intellectually challenging. It is also heartless. It struggles to stimulate emotion. Cleverness replaces impact. Di Caprio's one-dimensional acting reinforces this sterility. From the first shot of a grim face we get the whole range of grim faces in a grim performance. He is grim about his kids, grim about the folding graphics, grim about his team, grim about the task in hand. Of the Matrix- plus effect I did like the folding city, but the ending was portentous to the point of tedium. One very good litmus test of the quality of a film is to analyse how many times the main protagonists have to explain the plot and at what length they have to explain it. Several characters explain the rules of the dream within a dream within a dream construct at the heart of the movie, with increasing loquaciousness and qualifications. This isn't plotting and it fails to create a genuine narrative drive. Compare it to so many of the films that come below this one in the rankings, Twelve Angry Men, Seven Samurai, Goodfellas, Casablanca, Once upon a time in America, Citizen Kane for goodness' sake. Don't even mention films like Shawshank and the Godfather which rank above it. This is a good film, possibly one of the better films of the year. It is a very long way from a great one.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Went to see it today and came out of the cinema very disappointed, borderline angry... I have to admit though that my expectations were too big for what is after all just another summer blockbuster. First the story, you\\'d call it original if someone like Philip K Dick had never existed. Thing is, he really existed (we could question that after all, that would probably please both Dick and Nolan... Sigh)and he wrote dozens of books on the subject, which makes this movie anything but original storytelling wise. Also the movie is far too long, they should have cut off at least 30-45 minutes, almost fell asleep at the 1h30 point. The scenario is not even well thought, sometimes even incoherent and the director tries to hide its weaknesses with lots SFX and gunshots. I\\'m especially thinking about the last \"jump\" to go to the limbos, it\\'s not the 4th level as there\\'s no 4th level in the architect plans, the limbos, as previously told during the movie, is the place you end up in when you die in the dream and can\\'t wake up in real life, so why is it suddenly possible for them to get there without dying ? (and don\\'t serve me the \"they go in Cobb\\'s mind\" crap, i don\\'t buy it) Good points in the movie : SFX (i loved Paris folding on itself) Cast (thank god there were good actors in that movie...)All in all not such a bad movie, but certainly not a masterpiece of sheer originality. 5/10 would be my note if it wasn\\'t so over-hyped, I chose to give 3/10 to strike back on the sheep giving it a ten when it certainly does not deserve it AT ALL.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : ~MY REVIEW CONTAINS SEVERAL REFERENCES TO TARKOVSKY, A QUOTATION FROM ROGER EBERT AND ANOTHER FROM CHRISTOPHER NOLAN\\'S INCEPTION SCRIPT (for detailed info check below the end of this article)~ Ideas need to be enriched while the roots are kept loyal, especially in Sci-Fi. Above everything else, aware of the fact that while the story is taking place in several dimensions of dreams, there is no link to the real-life. My first point is about this huge story development deficiency. The only link to our universal earth dimension is Michael Caine character and the children, and they\\'re frozen, they\\'re playing out there in the garden, we see from behind. This is the first thing why the whole movie is para-psychologically inappropriate. I said para-psychologically inappropriate, \\'cos today psychology is in the point that dreams expose supernatural(or meta-physical) skills of human mind. If you are implanting an idea through a dream into someone\\'s mind, it\\'s not that easy, THE BALANCE OF NATURE WOULDN\\'T EASILY LET YOU DO THAT. As an example I want to compare the Inception with \"The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind\". There, Jim Carrey was going back time in his dream trying to identify the person who is dating with his fiancée; but he ends up with facing a supernatural vitality covering the person\\'s face. The way Nolan explains is this: *(1)* \"Never recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places.\" When the time comes where Saito explains why he hired Cobb for the implantation, this is all we get: *(2)* \"You remind me of someone... a man I met in a half-remembered dream. He was possessed of some radical notions\" So the most important question one ever needs to ask \"How did they all start to dream implantation?\". There is no answer nor explanation to it. Whereas in its ancestor, \"The Minority Report\" was quite brilliant at explaining the technological advance. Compare with Matrix, the dreams are your guides to the reality, you\\'re not a guide to someone\\'s dream. Matrix gives you a clue of understanding how some people\\'s lives may change with their dreams and visions. It had this inspiration that Neo became a hero out of a loser. Dreams are able to do that, as Wachowski Brothers taught us. Another comparison can be done with the good and evil side. Nolan never divides people into good vs. evil as Batman or as Memento or any films he\\'s done. But for someone\\'s favor, Cobb is hired by business man to implant an idea into another business man, which doesn\\'t do any thing with the good. *(3)* \"The only condition of fighting for the right to create is faith in your own vocation, readiness to serve, and refusal to compromise\" Sci-Fi loves impossible, but it also denies the practical errors. Inception\\'s plot is theoretically fine but practically slow off the mark. Just like Roger Ebert said at Chicago Sun, Inception\\'s story can either be told in a few sentences or not told at all. Ebert\\'s approach to criticize Nolan\\'s earlier work was even more harsh. *(4)* \"How does a man with short-term memory loss, remember he has short-term memory loss?\" (for Memento). Some injuries can go engraved someone\\'s sub-conscious, so he didn\\'t even need to remember it, he was just living it. Though Ebert was right on one thing, that if Ellen Page hasn\\'t been enrolled in the movie as a new chosen one to this confidential job, the whole movie was almost meaning nonsense. The things that are likable is Marion Cotillard participating as a independent virus in dreams, going in and killing whoever and whenever she likes. Ellen Page is being used to create spaces in dreams, so that the missionaries will be able to create totems that tell a person whether they\\'re dreaming or living the reality. The only totem without Ellen Page was the spinning of the whipping top in the sleep house. Also the last dream which Di Caprio is having on the airplane was cut in the half as if it was meant for to be continued. It was the only dream that made me believe that someone is dreaming, whether it\\'s Cobb or Arthur or any of the missionaries. \\'CAUSE DREAMS NEVER LAST. *(1)*(2)*: from Quotes for Inception at IMDb / *(3)* : from Andrei Tarkovsky quotes at thinkexist.com / *(4)* : from Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times, July.14.2010\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : The movie is about manipulation of dreams and how it can impact a person\\'s psyche. Caprio, in this movie is a kind of dream terrorist, who as a profession extracts information from people\\'s mind. This is espionage of new times and he has become notoriously popular for this. However, for the last time when he undertakes a job of planting an idea into the mind of an heir to a giant business empire (Cillian Murphy ); things go wrong. I am disappointed by the script. The movie is conceptually flawed. First of all, how can you dream inside a dream, I mean how one transitions into next level of \\'sleepiness\\'. Even if one could, why the machine used to coordinate the dreams also appears the same in the dream and works also. Why one would age in a dream; I thought in a dream the appearance of oneself is the mental projection of the memory of oneself. Same genre has been portrayed by \"Paprika\" beautifully and is much more consistent and meaningful than this version of a dream-control fantasy.First act was a bit interesting, but the plot goes haywire towards the end; lost in an attempt to incorporate useless actions scenes. Ending was as terrible as one would expect after watching the trifling second act. Trying to give an inconclusive end was a bit pathetic after what has been done to original \\'idea\\'. There was no \\'original inspiration\\' in this movie. By the end of it, I was in level 5.Certainly a bad one from Nolan. This not nearly as good as \"Following\" or \"Prestige\". No surreal element; twisting the city was a fleeting attempt though.Watchable once and that too would be worthwhile only on a big screen.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : I like Christopher Nolan. He a good director. His little movie here, Inception, is one of those movies that give you brain burn. Allow me to explain! A rag tag team of handsome thieves invade people\\'s dreams and extract memories. But for some reason implanting ideas in someone\\'s head is super hard? No it\\'s not! Hypnotist do it all the time. Then this Arthur character says \"The dreamer can always remember the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake.\" Also, not true. People get source amnesia all the time. I\\'m sure you\\'ve met someone who claims to have invented a joke or a phrase that they actually heard from someone else. And these thieves are trying to get some wealthy hot-shot to shut down his bidnass? There\\'s an easier way to do that that doesn\\'t involve dream invasion. Wallstreet does it all the time. If some butt-wipe is getting too powerful, just bust him for any number of egregious crimes in which super wealthy billionaires inevitably get themselves involved. Or frame him and arrange some kind of take-over. 10000000000 times easier. Additionally, there are plenty of cheesy Hollywood shootouts where the bad guys can\\'t aim, and cars function perfectly fine after being filled with bullet holes. You could say the cars still work cuz it\\'s a dream, but then why do shot up people get totally screwed? I can overlook these ridiculous elements in a Jean Claude Van Damme movie by simply turning off my brain, but that\\'s exactly where everything goes wrong in this movie. Ya see, if this was a comedy, everything in the story would work. But it isn\\'t a comedy, is it, homies? heck no, son, it\\'s a psychological thriller! So it\\'s meant to stimulate your brain, but all the absurdities mentioned above ask you turn your brain off in order to enjoy it. So the constant turning on and off chafes your brain. Brain burn.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : I felt like I'm wasting my time with this movie, really. All of its plot is based on very simple idea, yet this simple idea fails to convince me that it's somehow possible in real world or necessary for heroes to accomplish or this movie is supposed to teach me something or relay the message. Come on, I was on the edge of my seat when I was watching The Matrix going WOW several times and I was never disappointed and what a simple yet powerful message this was! With Inception I felt like watching The Prison Break series episode 10050. The movie provides absolutely no answers why I should bother to worry if they deliver the thought to the poor sob's head which they drugged on the plane. I simply don't care if they succeed or not. No immersion. In general words, special effects were good, street/bridge bending animations were good, yet I was bored the whole time. 6 out of 10 for this pointless flick which I forget in few weeks.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : As Christopher Nolan\\'s budgets get bigger, his movies get worse. He is an excellent director when he is given a project that isn\\'t overly ambitious. With his more \"epic\", \"blockbuster\" films though, he shows a lot more weaknesses. Nothing illustrates those weaknesses more than Inception. It is a movie that starts off at the same level as Memento, but declines and hits rock bottom on the same level as the recent Transformers movies. I\\'m not exaggerating when I say that the last 45 minutes or so of the movie is that bad. It is nothing but the same loud, poorly shot, poorly choreographed, and boring action that has spread throughout movies nowadays like a disease.For at least the first hour, I could see why this movie got such great reviews. It presents itself initially as a dark and surreal Ocean\\'s Eleven. The first act is spent acquainting us with the rules of dream thievery while the main character, Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), assembles his \"safecracking\" team. In typical caper movie fashion, he finds the specialists that he needs, all of whom have their own talents and personalities. There is the chemist who will whip up the special cocktail needed to sedate everyone for this special job. There the dream actor who can impersonate anyone. There is the financier who hired Cobb and wants to come along to monitor his investment. There is the architect responsible for building the dreamscapes in which the \"safecrackers\" will pull off their caper. The target of this scheme is Robert Fischer (Cilian Murphy), the sole heir to a huge corporate empire. The purpose of this scheme is not to steal anything, but to implant the idea into Fischer\\'s head that he should break up his father\\'s empire. To do that, Cobb and his buddies concoct an incredibly complex scheme that involves a dream within a dream within a dream.For a while, I thought that I was in heaven. But then, in Act II when the caper officially starts, I began to feel doubts. Within minutes, there is a massive car chase and the bullets are flying from all directions. When the dreaming starts, you get a taste of what the rest of the movie is going to be like. Tons and tons of shooting, chases, and action that drags on and on despite having almost no relevance to the plot. It\\'s bad in the dream, it\\'s pretty bad in the dream within a dream, and Holy Jesus, is it ever awful in the dream within a dream within a dream.As the movie progresses, the action becomes more pointless and the action scenes become progressively harder to follow. Dozens of guys who dress like Secret Service agents are gunned down or karate chopped to death. Approximately a half hour is one gigantic non-stop action scene that takes place across all of the dream levels. While the idea of a half hour of non-stop action might sound nice, it drags horribly. Almost no plot development takes place this entire time. There is a shot of a van slowly falling towards the water. Across the long action scene, that van is shown about five or six times. By the time that you are done with this movie, you will be sick to death of seeing that stupid van falling towards the water.Why is it that this movie can\\'t make gunfire and car chases exciting? For starters, the action is very poorly choreographed. You get no sense of location. The challenges that the good guys are facing aren\\'t clearly laid out. Who is where? How many bad guys are there? What you do get is good old shaky-cam, loads of CGI, Matrix-inspired floating, and close-ups of dudes shooting guns. In other words, you get the crap that has virtually destroyed action movies nowadays. Today\\'s directors could learn a lot from action classics like Commando and Die Hard.Speaking of CGI, this movie also has tons of that, and it is technologically impressive, but mostly pointless. The one scene that everybody seems to rave about is the Paris scene where half of the city gets folded in over itself. Eh – whatever. It looks cool, but – who cares? When did this become part of having a great movie? And why is it that the Road Warrior and the original Star Wars still look cooler to me than modern movies with five times the budget?While I enjoyed most of the non-action parts, this also is probably Nolan\\'s most pretentious movie. The movie starts with the line \"What is the most resilient parasite?\" The answer: \"an idea\". What is this twaddle? Ideas aren\\'t like parasites. I\\'m constantly seeing ideas brought up, shot down, and forgotten about. And why do you need to tell me this – to look smart? Inception is constantly throwing new dream rules at you, and by the end they are a confusing mess. It is these kinds of problems that inspire people to criticize Inception as being a dumb movie that tries to position itself as a smart one.To sum it all up, I think that Inception, in 20 years, will not be viewed by Christopher Nolan fans as one of his best. In fact, I believe that it is his worst film. This guy cannot do good action, and when he has a budget to spend, it seems to just make the movie longer and prettier, but not better. From these criticisms, you might get the impression that I hated the movie. I didn\\'t. Even during the most boring scenes, I wanted the whole scheme to work, and I cared about Dom Cobb enough to be hoping that he would triumph in the end. I did enjoy it enough to watch the movie a second time, just to see if I would like it better. I had the same feelings again – falling in love at first, only to be disappointed in the end.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Good points. Well, the visuals were great that's for sure. The way they bent reality and had rooms spin and cities shift and stuff blow up, sure, great action. The soundtrack is good as well but it doesn't have any memorable tunes.Bad points. What the hell was that action all about? Projections of someone's mind were typical people attacking the incerptors. Am I to believe that the ultimate defense a person's mind has is... faceless mooks? Where are the dragons, the supermen, the giant robots? Something that is NOT faceless mooks? If this is the realm of dreams then it should be filled with such stuff, there is no holding back. Not even the most pragmatic mind would be without such stuff. So here I am watching an hour long action scene that is better fit for a James Bond film (minus the rotating rooms) than an adventure in the subconscious mind of troubled men. Makes little sense. Then the dialogues. Although the explanations around how the inception works were great and I did understand the concept, I found that it took a huge chunk of the duration. Half of the dialogues feel like the characters are indirectly explaining the theory to us. Something that they wouldn't since they are supposed to know such stuff and have no need to mention them.Good point. The story is indeed interesting and offers a concept around the blurring of reality that has never been offered exactly like this before.Bad point. The actual plot outside the interesting concept is mostly thrown away at shoot outs and explosions with random mooks that have nothing to do with a person's mind. If I dream something, I am the dream. Everyone is me, everyone acts like me, everything reacts like me. Yet the movie wants us to think our dream is like reality. I was not convinced that a dreamworld is so stiff. It was changing all right but the moment someone knows he is dreaming and doesn't wake up, he doesn't need to run or hide. He can mold everything where he stands and play it God. Thus the movie doesn't literally show how dreams work. It just gives you some nice ideas and wastes the rest in action scenes you can find even in a normal action movie.Acting... no good or bad points here. There are no prevailing characters for all I care. The idea and the action overshadow the actors. Di Caprio and the gang did their parts well but I still find it hard to believe that such an unstable personality that has his murderous wife chasing him in dreams would be allowed to go on in such delicate missions. It's like inviting Freddy Krugger to chop you to pieces while the world hangs at the edge of the cliff. Bad plot element.So is this movie good? In theory, yes. Action lovers and eggheads will love it. Scriptwritters may get some nice ideas from. But as far as I care it is NOT a masterpiece. It has too many convenient events, too much holding back, too much infodump, too much out-of place action.Things that I would change to make this movie better: -No shootings with faceless mooks and blowing stuff just for the heck of it. -More dream morphing scenes in places of fore-mentioned pointless action. -Less infodump. -Less corny dead wife drama. We have Solaris for that.The Cage is a movie doing a rather better portrait of a man's dreamworld. Not so much mambo jumbo around how it works but shows it better. And of course there is Solaris (dead wife thing) and Matrix (cool action) and James Bond (shooting and blowing stuff) to take out most other good parts of the movie. By the end of it, only the idea of inception is what stands out. And it wasn't exploited that much really.\\n\",\n",

The story was weak and I am shocked how many people are giving this 10 stars. 8 people I worked with saw this and only 1 liked it. This is two weird movies in a row made by Leonardo DiCaprio.I feel like Nolan is just revamping parts of Memento, Batman, Dark Knight etc to his movies. The ending credits are the same for every movie. He put in a fortress in the snow like the fortress in the beginning of Batman Returns. And what about that snow? It's like he just wanted to say let's film in the snow! He is actually stealing a lot of this from other movies and getting the credit for this being an original movie.

However, in a few couple of years, these CGI effects will not be that impressive anymore, and then people will (hopefully) see how lacking this movie is for a good story and characters. The average moviegoer will love this movie, but if you like good movies in the sci-fi genre, you kind of expect at least some plot twists. Still, the movie is good, and well made, but not great, It will most probably be forgotten in a couple of yearsIf you enjoy movies with action and CGI and want a movie to watch with friends, go see this movie.

Almost everyone has had that experience of being disappointed by a film that you have been really looking forward to - this was a prime example. First of all the acting - Keanu Reeves and Joseph Gordon-Levitt - separated at birth, and neither can act at all. I liked Ellen Page very much in Juno, but she was sadly miscast in this role. Not that any actress could have made sense out of her character - she was at random times a newbie, who needed the basics explained, and/or an authority on how the whole thing worked. The plot was filled with these messy holes, but it wasn't entirely negative - some of the effects were fun, and DiCaprio is always good, as was most of his supporting cast. On the whole, worth seeing, just don't expect it to be the best film you ever saw.\\n\",\n",

If you want to see how to do dreams in cinema, look elsewhere, for example the dream sequence in Wild Strawberries, the Soldier's dreams in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, the whole of Un Chien Andalou.

This is why I love movies ... why imagination is the greatest human gift ... why I dream to write such creative and intelligent stories ... And still ... I don\\'t know how to feel ... Movies like this should be praised and loved ... I loved it, but I feel something messy now in my mind, and that I can\\'t get out ... I need to watch it again ... this is not a movie to watch once ... definitely ... it\\'s so disturbing it\\'s great, so great it\\'s disturbing ...\" 10/10This is the raw feeling, authentic? sincere? naive? well it was the immediate one, one that couldn\\'t be altered by other viewer\\'s opinions, praises or criticisms. This is how I felt when the movie ended. A second watching transported me from ecstasy in perception to ...REVIEW 2 : Originality in Conception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\"It\\'s a dazzling intelligence-challenging puzzle, but only on an intellectual level, not emotional. Why not? Should all the movies have a \\'heart\\' beating inside ... as long as it makes yours do. Now I understand the film and love it because I decided not to care for the emotion and just try to understand the story. And with this mindset, believe me, \"Inception\" is an incredible experience. The movie is a fantasy and remains realistic in the same time, it\\'s real because we know it\\'s fake, but the fake world feels so real because we can technically live in. It doesn\\'t say anything about dreams and subconsciousness, because it\\'s all about actual and virtual reality, perceptions and intentions. As a script, it\\'s a very impressive work from Christopher Nolan, not to mention the brilliant editing. Yes, I know I\\'m watching a film, but this one I value as an intricate puzzle that challenges my intelligence. \"Inception\" is like a cinematic Rubik\\'s cube.\" 9,5/10I was still loving the film, but in the meantime, starting to concede that the enjoyment was more on a technical level, on the construction of the plot and the intricacy of the script ... I admitted that the whole Mal-Cobb subplot was just plot devices to insert a melodrama, necessary to plunge us in Cobb\\'s subconscious and inject it into Fisher\\'s dreams, combining this way two parallel worlds, two narrative structures. In such action-driven films, \\'forced\\' is \\'flat\\' and melodrama must be handled carefully. The movie was perceived as excellent by my humble mind, but more in a cinematographic, geometric, almost pragmatic way ... which brings me to ...REVIEW 3 : Enthusiasm in Reception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\"It\\'s a great film that should grab the Oscars for Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Visual Effects, Sound Effects, Best Cinematography. If it didn\\'t, there would be no justice!\" 8/10I knew I enjoyed the movie because as I mentioned before, it featured great thrills, action, script, music, editing, visuals ... hence the word \\'sensational\\' I used in the beginning of this review. But as I titled in another review : \"many elements of greatness don\\'t necessarily make a great film\". I started to question myself. It\\'s a film about dreams, about subconscious, right? but did I sense a real escapism in those supposedly dreamy settings? didn\\'t those dreams look a little bit like micro-episodes from formulaic action films? could the fights (or anything for that matter) be more imaginative? did the Mal-Cobb subplot make me feel sympathy for any of them? did I really care for Cobb? or did Leo make me care for his character? did I care for the whole mission? did any of the characters appeal to me? So many interrogation marks leading me to the \"Limbo\" review ...REVIEW 4 : Realism in Deception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\"Wow ... this movie has a really strange power, it leaves me ecstatic when it finishes, and then the more I think about it, the more I realize that the very aspect that made me love the film could\\'ve been handled in a better way and with a deeper characterization: less chase scenes and shootings, more imagination and by that, I mean more beautiful settings and creative plot devices ... This movie is a cinematic experience that makes you scratch your head and hold your breath, but does it deserve all the praise? I wonder how I fell for this one, but I think it\\'s time to retract myself and admit my judgment mistake. Yes, the movie is a cinematic Rubik\\'s cube, but I guess I forgot how I used to get quickly bored by this game. How did I change my mind ? ... I don\\'t know ... thinking, reading, realizing, sharing views, using this mind \"Inception\" tried to twist ... A very creative film, I wish it will win all the Oscars previously mentioned, but beyond the creativity of the concept ... what did I enjoy? I guess only the concept, the rest was just ... all flash and no substance\" 6/10Yep, the rating also fell through 4 \"layers\" ... what a painful awakening, this movie amazed me so much, I couldn\\'t feel anything negative about it ... and one thing for sure, \"Inception\" has the weirdest power of attraction when you watch it for the first time, that\\'s why I understand its popularity. It\\'s like my mind had already accepted the idea that the movie would be a masterpiece just because it relied on a particularly innovative concept.

With Christopher Nolan of \"Memento\" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, \"Inception\" is a bloated failure.The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What\\'s going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that\\'s the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn\\'t nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it\\'s time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination.

But things start to go drastically wrong when Cobb takes on a seemingly impossible job and his dead wife turns up to make trouble.Ingenious but convoluted, Inception may not be to everyone's taste – but it is undoubtedly a Chris Nolan picture; the same man who gave us Memento, The Prestige and of course, The Dark Knight. The problem is that for all the slick visuals and clever narrative structures, we end up with something cold, clinical and frustratingly diffuse.Why Inception falters, and I appreciate that I may be in the minority, is that for such a surreal and imaginative concept to work, it requires an equally surreal and imaginative mind, and Nolan is just too conservative and too technical for the content.

Next day I tried to watch it again and made it trough another have hour. I had payed money for it so I wanted to see it. third time I made it through the movie.the theme about dreaming is interesting enough,but they try to long to explain what was going on. Imho it was kind of self explained.I felt nothing for the characters.the plot doesn't get interesting or I didn't get the plot.there is no humour in the movie, they take themselfes to seriously.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Alright folks, I saw the same movie you saw. My wife and I both went into this with great expectations. Visually, the movie was interesting. Beyond that, it was ho-hum for us. I felt myself fidgeting in the seat several times wondering when they were going to get to the point. The film was about 45 minutes too long. The concept is very interesting, but there are so many loopholes and unanswered questions and illogical contrivances that we both just shook our heads and enjoyed the scenery. I have to wonder where all of the high ratings for this flick are coming from. I am not buying that as many people loved this thing on the same par as Lord of the Rings and Godfather. This movie was so pumped up that I was hoping for something brilliant like The Matrix. I feel like I got something more similar to \"The Happening\".\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Inception makes the average moviegoer feel smart and I would have zero problem with that,unless fans weren\\'t so extremely elitist and condescending. I DO get it...and neither love or hate it. Limited vocabulary but maybe a good read?DiCaprio has reached such super-stardom that can only be compared with Stallone,Schwarzenegger and Will Smith. Meaning:No matter who stars alongside him,he\\'s the only one who sells the film.Just like in Shutter Island,Inceptions trailer only mentions LEONARDO.DICAPRIO.If Watanabe,Cotilliard,Murphy and the rest(Oscarwinners and Oscarnominees,come on) co-star,I might want to know. Studios,respect actors...and ON PAPER,the mix of actors intrigues. Plotwise though,it\\'s all about Mal.Nolan had all the time he wanted to create a caper that was provocative or involved fates of main characters,danger! Morally ambiguous maybe! Yet,planting the seed in a business-mans head that selling his fathers company is his own idea is the result. HOW PG and unpersonal can we get? No room for both a new concept,a bold plot and developed characters...? Nope. Understand it could\\'ve been to get a mail-man to call in sick the next day,heist irrelevant. 80% of Inception evolves around the caper,still it merely becomes window dressing,a distraction from the core,the human heart that occasionally beats,being the relationship between Dom and his bad conscience in the shape of Cotilliards Mal.All scenes involving her are superb,it\\'s a nuanced performance worthy of an Oscarnomination. Mal is dangerous,sad,disturbed, beautiful and Very dead. One scene especially involving a ledge is great,heartbreaking cinema. That the person who\\'s most alive and complex is deceased..Paradox...but a good hint at the misuse of actors.Several actors could just\\'ve switched names,their characters don\\'t have personalities. What did you do here,Christopher? They describe rules for the dreamworld,dream-extraction,describe what\\'s happening at the moment, that\\'s it.When Swick casted Watanabe in The last samurai,he knew the screenplay matched the mans potential. Nolan has with Batman begins and Inception twice wasted his talent...Murphy? Think I rather see him type-casted as sophisticated sociopaths alá Red Eye then see him as a blank page.Inception\\'s the star and while a detailed construction, intentionally confusing and complex,you DO have to pay attention,complex does not equal intelligent. As you take the ride,things move fast and you\\'re not allowed to break and examine. It\\'s only when it\\'s over you realize you were standing still all along. You are cleverly manipulated into believing the story makes you think(Cause you understand what you saw.Not the same..)or that your mind discovers philosophical metaphors. That you are witnessing something deep is shoved down your throat but depth is mostly absent.Sure,the film deserves the Oscars. Things sound great,look great. Buildings become bridges. An orgasm for the eyes. Pfisters camera-work here is great,very colorful,crisp,clean. Imaginative art direction. I dig Zimmers less-is-more score. In general the whole film\\'s eye candy,perfect surface. The inside...?1.Alright,WAY too much shooting and \"violence\" going on here, considering everyone\\'s sound asleep on a plane and thoughts are murdered. Would\\'ve been more intriguing with psychological tension instead of train-crashes and explosions but lack of a REAL physical threat only manages to turn suspense into a dream as well. Sleeping boy vs. thought in zero gravity is so pointless,the impressive CGI just confirms Nolans smug self-awareness of his competent,VISUAL execution and just cements the surface statement. 2. Limbo. Wouldn\\'t a dream-extractors worst nightmare be LIMBO,wouldn\\'t it come up in a conversation between professionals at some point probably? No...not even mentioned until drama occurs. 3.For the 5th time,a womans accidental death consumes a wealthy,white man between 30 and 35 with guilt that will define him and her role is again pivotal. It\\'s getting old and predictable,I hope the issues are worked out by now.4.Last scene. It defines and sums up Inceptions feeling of surface reaching for depth and jaw breaking response,artistic pretensions,strained complexity for the sake of complexity rather then genuinely clever. Nolan in desperation wants to wrap it up so it leaves us scratching our heads... I was banging my head against the seat in front of me when the end credits rolled.He leaves you with two options,no scenarios or reasons that make or should make you come up with an own conclusion. Far from a thinking mans thriller. One of the two is a joke used when referring to funny,lousy twists in B-thrillers. So... No why or how,just IF...IF films were people,Nolans own Memento,The usual suspects or Fight Club would blush,look at 8.8 and put a pistol in their mouth when the words\"Smart,thought-provoking thriller\" puts Inception next door to them. The ending insults us,a cop out. Definition of a writer not knowing neither how to quit while ahead or how a journey is gonna reach a classic destination worthy of the plots seemingly intricate layers and ambitions. Sooo...he passes the ball to you and washes his hands with 15 seconds to go,smart lad. A picture this celebrated for being smart should hold up under a magnifying glass. It burns up without you even turning it towards the sun,man. This is an experiment and Nolans monster looks good,but at times,it comes close to the IQ of Dr.Frankensteins creation. DiCaprio gives a solid and mature performance,Hardy makes the most of what little the script offers and gives Eames mannerisms,charisma and a sense of humor. Cotilliard is amazing like stated.The rest could\\'ve been portrayed by Gary Busey,Eric Roberts and Lindsay Lohan...Nolans 1st failure is a mix of beauty,superficial intelligence and posturing. Caught between a flawed,pretty entertaining film and a bad one. Mediocre becomes bad when it comes to this director....so shallow.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : \"Inception\" might have been a better movie -- and would certainly have been more entertaining -- had writer/director Christopher Nolan not made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire 2:25 running time explaining itself to its audience.Seriously, the exposition Never. Stops. There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character, which of course was a ham-fisted way of explaining it to us. But even with all of that aggressive exposition, the movie never does make a lot of sense. The result is a lot of busyness -- oh, there\\'s always plenty of stuff going on -- that\\'s nevertheless pretty boring because it\\'s never clear what all of the busyness is for.Nolan has done this to us before. Who the hell came out of \"The Prestige\" with any clue what that movie was about? And even his more narratively coherent films (like \"The Dark Knight\") suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises can\\'t support. \"Inception\" is no exception (ha!). The movie is junk trying to disguise itself as something important and significant. How much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be junk.Grade: C-\\n',\n",

The acting is good but the content lacks a truly engaging story line. It lures you in but never manages to hook you. They shouldve explored other characters rather than Cobb. It seems to me as though the film could've been pulled off with a less talented supporting cast. Also it is slightly confusing in some parts. Other parts are way too predictable. This is NOT the MIND BLOWING film people talk it up to be. Those people out there who say this is a GREAT film are mistaken. Although in saying that it stills scores a solid 5/10. Cam\\n\",\n",

I go the movies to be entertained, to be transported into the movie, to be involved and have my emotions stirred. Inception did none of that, it failed because it focused on the creativity but forgot about the audience. Credit must be given to the special effects, the acting and the creative content, but the praise stops there.I have read a lot of the reviews here and I have to say I'm very surprised, I simply don't agree with the high rating this movie has been awarded with. If you would like to watch an interesting, creative and action packed movie, this will not disappoint. For me, there were too many implausible (bordering on ridiculous) twists to enable me to enjoy it. The technical aspects surrounding the connectivity between the participants was just nonsense, there was little explanation, little offered on how it worked and why. Clearly someone thought the audience would just let that part slide and not be too fussed about the technicalities.This is a selfish movie, its been written, produced and directed to be creative, amazing and intelligent.. the problem is someone forgot about the audience. I for one was not engaged, transported nor were my emotions stirred..apart from feeling annoyed and disappointed.I expected so much more from this movie..\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Inception - I saw this a while ago. I only write about it, because South Park was making fun of it last night. I never got the enthusiasm for this flick. It was somewhat entertaining, although, certainly not mind blowing or even that inventive. I\\'ve seen more mind bending things on the Outer Limits from the 60\\'s. It was not memorable. In fact, I had forgotten about it until last night. One of the things I remember was how poorly Ellen Page\\'s character was rounded out. I remember laughing, not at her - but at the part she had to play, Ms. Exposition. Explain everything to her, so the audience knows what is going on. The action was cliché, and left me wanting more. The whole thing about going into someone\\'s dream is so silly, but not funny silly - which leads me to...South Park, on the other hand. Was a lot more fun. Throw in a Sheep Herder, a young Mr. Mackey, a random pizza delivery guy, and even a retired Freddy Kruger and you\\'ve got an entertaining 22 minutes. And, of course, Randy Marsh. Stan is trapped in Mr. Mackey\\'s dream, so Randy goes in to save him. Stan sees his dad in the dream. But his dad has come into the dream as a Butterfly.

       " 'Review of Inception : I cannot believe people have voted this movie 9.0. I never critique a movie just because it does not make sense, I love quite a few extremely stupid b-movies which are far from making any sense. In my opinion, a movie can make no sense all right, provided it is still entertaining. However, this one does happen to make so little sense that it should be classified as fantasy, not sci-fi, as explained in detail in many \"Hated It\" comments here. And as for entertainment, Inception, a movie about dreams, ironically made me so sleepy I barely made it to the end.Basically most \"Loved It\" comments here posit this movie to be pure \"genius\" because it is so \"complex\" and \"multi-layered\". If you don\\'t like it, you must be too stupid to understand all the supposedly mesmerizing, breathtaking and complex \"layers\" or \"levels\". In short, an idea that one can dream within a dream either \"blows your mind\" or you are stupid. Well, okay, maybe it\\'s just me. I happen to have been reading sci-fi since my early childhood, plus virtually all the software code I write actually represent a complex and multi-layered virtual reality, so I\\'m personally not that impressed. Looks like the \"Loved It\" guys were truly \"mesmerized\" by the dream-within-a-dream idea though, must have been quite an intellectual shock for them. I\\'m not saying there is anything wrong with it, only that it\\'s not necessarily a \"genius\" in 2010. I would probably be \"mesmerized\" if I watched Nolan\\'s movie in, say, 1910 (or to be on the safe side, in 1810).The worst was the casting, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page are good actors, but their cute & cuddly faces in a supposedly dark and moody sci-fi movie? No credibility at all, that completely threw me off. That choice would be perfect if Nolan was at least shooting for so-bad-it\\'s-good movie. As a result, Inception is so-average-it-makes-you-sleepy movie.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : No, seriously. It's not as good as people say. It did win four Oscars, but those were all in areas where the film truly does excel: visuals and sound.As for the plot, it's as full of holes as a Swiss cheese and about as smelly. A great cast can do little to make up for that.Don't believe me?http://bit.ly/1mk1xvyhttp://bit.ly/1p5u23wI really can't add much to that.The plot holes and the major inconsistencies, paired with the philosophical depth of a 14-year- old (is really ANYTHING real???) means there's little going for this film beyond the amazing visual effects and sound. Now, that would go a long way, if not for the fact that it's so ridiculously loooong! What we have here is a sensory tour de force dragged down by an atrociously poor story played out by amazing actors trying desperately to bring life to ridiculously shallow and one-dimensional characters.I've tried. I've seen it twice by now. That's five hours of my life I'm not getting back.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : For a film that deals in the world of dreams this film lacks a lot of imagination. I think that in being a Hollywood blockbuster it had to tick a certain amount of boxes that are necessary for the monumental amounts of money that are thrown at it.The first 30 minutes I was interested by the concept and the pacing of the film. The concept of espionage within a dream is an interesting enough concept. I was very open and excited by the idea of going into the world of dreams with the characters. I wish they could have perhaps explored a little more and pushed the boundaries of the dreams. It seemed that time and space flowed a little too seamlessly. Perhaps Kafka's 'The Trial' or a more Cronenberg style would have helped.After the first 30 minutes it sunk into the normal plodding of a Hollywood blockbuster. Are we watching Mission Impossible or a film about dreams? Unfortunately the last two thirds of the film were more Mission Impossible. I couldn't help thinking of the could have beens. All I remember is a van falling for two hours, some irrelevant action scenes in the tundra, and an in-durable no gravity scene which had me yawning.Oh and am I the only one who cannot stand Marion Coutillard?\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : It could possibly be Leonardo DiCaprio. That\\'s a bit harsh – I know he has to eat too – but does he have to always play the same sanctimonious, pedantic, self-righteous know-it-all? And he\\'s been in some bad movies recently. \"Revolutionary Road\" was a potentially good movie, but he always comes off as immature. \"Shutter Island\" was so transparent that I guessed the ending about 10 minutes in. But, this is supposed to be about \"Inception\"...Yes, \"Inception\", a movie so simplistic that I yawned throughout. My (lucky) wife fell asleep claiming that it wasn\\'t of interest to her. What claimed to be a smart, intelligent thriller, turned out to be the usual bag of guns, explosions, chases, etc. The plot, paper-thin and without any real point, is a yawn-fest of borrowed ideas and takes liberally from movies we\\'ve seen before. Is 10 years really soon enough to remake \"The Matrix\" (with Ellen Page as Neo)? Dennis Quaid in \"Dreamscape\" is far more entertaining. \"Videodrome\" is way more complex and intriguing, a movie that makes the viewer work.While the acting is fair enough for an action flick, there isn\\'t much to say about the movie at all. It\\'s pretty 1-dimensional and quite dumb. What really irks me is the fact that I was told repeatedly about how this movie was so complex, complicated, hard to understand, etc. It\\'s really not. It just uses a nonsensical plot device; that of layered dreaming, to try and outwit the audience. While completely ridiculous – isn\\'t a dream within a dream just part of the same dream? – it\\'s also not hard to grasp. Is the bar really that low? What would the audience that this bamboozled make of a movie like \"Primer\" which is one of the most complex movies ever devised. Even \"Mission Impossible\" had more plot twists and turns than this drivel.To be honest it was barely just okay. It was boring like a bus-ride through Nebraska. Your mind is the scene of the crime? I didn\\'t see much of any crime - just some folks trying to get a guy to change his mind. Big deal. Michael Caine is even becoming a Director\\'s Trademark. His two minutes on-screen were gratuitous at best, certainly not a requirement to the story.So, to wrap up: boring, simple-minded, dumb, nonsensical plot with no \\'science\\' and barely any \\'fiction\\', less-than-average acting, annoying constant music while people are talking, convenient \\'get-outs\\' when the logic of the story fails, which is frequently. Wow, I actually think I hate this movie.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : yes, it's brilliant! the cinematic effect was outstanding! but what is the real essence of the story? what is the core idea? simple: stealing ideas or implanting one through the dream state. that's it.i felt so dumb while i'm watching this movie. there are so many questions left in my mind after. a good movie does not do that to audiences. it can be complex, it can be convoluted, but in the end the viewers should have a grip on it. at first, i was astounded by the very idea of the story but as i reflected on it i realized that the only thing the film successfully did is obscure the brilliance of the core idea. a good movie communicates with its audience. inception only blurred the communication lines.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : There were only a handful of moments throughout \"Inception\" where I didn\\'t feel like I was watching actors going through the motions of a plot too complex for them to keep track of during filming. I imagined the directorial staff telling them: \"Hey you, run over here, then turn around that way.....just do it, don\\'t ask why right now!\"I don\\'t think DiCaprio was very well cast. He can be intense, but often comes off like a teenager posing as an adult. This role called for someone more eccentric with a mysterious presence. Likewise, the architect girl seemed like she belonged in high school, though she was nice to look at.The plot had a good premise but it barely got me involved psychologically. After the first hour or so, the layers of complexity got ahead of themselves and erased any real feeling of suspense. You need a decent grasp of what\\'s actually going on to feel suspense. Due to the lack of focus, I found my eyes straying to things like the Joliesque bump on the wife\\'s forehead, etc. A good film doesn\\'t let the mind wander.After a point, this thing became so convoluted that I was trying to figure out how it was made (on a technical level) rather than putting serious effort into following the plot. Yes, I got the gist of the dream layers and the general plan, but the timing of the \"kicks\" became too hard to follow.I spent half my viewing time wondering why dreams, which in real life contain random absurdities, could be so precise, down to the timing of bombs. These dreams never seemed like ones I\\'ve experienced, so the main premise of the movie was \"kicked\" out the door early on. Technology- wise, it seems highly unlikely that people could share dreams except for random electrical pulses.Maybe it played better in a big theater with the crowd adding to the substantial hype that preceded it. I saw it at home on Blu-ray and it just didn\\'t fire me up. I even considered turning it off twice, but the very end was clever enough to make it worth the slog.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : It was a pretty good movie, however, when I am able to predict the twists and turns that are going to be taken - and in the first 15 minutes of watching the movie - the movie automatically gets a lower score with me. I cannot count how many of these movies are being made, and most of them are using the same repetitive path - what you think is reality isn't - the one who's in charge - or 'In the know' is the one who's psycho, schizophrenic, or mentally unstable. I was surprised that after Leo did Shutter Island, that he'd just turn around and do the same kind of movie. (For those who didn't notice - the top kept spinning in the end shot - meaning he was dreaming - not actually awake - which means he was the one all along who was in err). The acting was a bit over the top and not convincing enough. The script wasn't that great, and I already can visualize certain types of people making attempts to practice this sort of thing. Among those 'certain types' you will also find hoards of conversations about 'lucid dreaming' and 'out of body experience', huge attractions to witchcraft, Harry Potter, etc, 'reality' shows, trash TV, RPG's and other games - basically - a lot of fantasy and unreality type of attractions. This movie will be a cult classic to them, maybe even their bible. The good thing about this movie does indeed need to be noted, however. We are living in an unreality & fantasy based society and it's ever growing. This movie shows the dangers of living in in that kind of mode, where a person starts getting more and more confused about what is real and what isn't. I ended up fast forwarding through quite a bit. It's getting a total score of 9??? Up for awards??? Com'on people. There's no logic why this movie is getting these kind of ratings.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : I'm going to keep this short the movie was over hyped, I enjoy Nolans movie Memento, he really took a complex idea and made it work.In this movie the idea fails and seems to mimic and follow the lines of Matrix, although I feel Matrix had a better atmosphere, style, and creativity.Although this is not a bad movie, but in my opinion it is not worth a nomination for best picture, or the great reviews people are giving this movie.I loved the soundtrack, and the CGI was really top notch in this movie, what I didn't enjoy was how the dreams were perceived and were fleshed out they didn't seem like dreams and they couldn't control them like you would your dreams it was more like a computer world, or alternate reality/parallel universe.The story was also over complicated with subplots that took you away from the film. I felt like this movie was stuck in mud and the only way to break it up was to but some intense action sequences, which made it seem to much like the matrix.I will not say I hated this movie, but did not enjoy it the way I thought I would. I love dream/reality movies it my favorite topic it just seems like this movie went to close to the matrix instead of making a thought provoking movie about dreams/reality and what is real what is not...\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Let me begin by saying that Inception is not bad, but it certainly isn't great. Nolan's script fails in multiple areas that harm the film significantly.1. The characterization is mediocre. Most of the members of the team are one-note, shallow and uninteresting. This greatly hampers your emotional attachment to the film and prevents you from caring about the outcome. Compared to the intense and complex characters of The Prestige, Insomnia, and Memento, the cast of Inception appears to be mostly slick suits walking around and doing things.2. The grandiose themes and interesting concepts that existed in The Dark Knight or Batman Begins are nowhere to be found here. Terrorism, corruption, or duty are ignored for love (which is dealt with in some of the most trite dialogue ever).3. The plot is too twisty for it's own good, resulting in you appreciating it less as a film and more as a puzzle. Vaguity does not equal genius, contrary to many critic's beliefs.In conclusion, Inception is a visually stunning film with aspirations at being significant, but it fails. Is it a thoughtful blockbuster? Yes. Is it the worst film Nolan has ever made? Absolutely. Should you watch it? Yes.\\n\",\n",

Because Nolan's History of Film making was what I was confident about. Memento, The Dark Knight are the two Movies which got a 10/10 and 9/10 rating from me respectively. But Inception, It was neither Memento, Nor The Dark Knight. It was more of a screenplay forcing you to believe it and to make it look genuine BUT with flawed ways and formulaic techniques which didn't work for me.Other than that it was fine. Visuals, Performances, Editing were all fine and the Camera Used for the movie was not the perfect choice. Direction as usual was POWERFUL but it was the story that didn't really appealed me.It is a movie with fine content but a forcing (in a wrong way) story. 6/10.

       " \"Review of Inception : This film really let me down.I didn't expect a great film but I expected something that was at least 'OK'. How wrong I was. I honestly can't understand the hype. 'Intelligent' they say?? What sort of intelligent film has to have it's protagonists explain what is happening continuously throughout the film?? Now Memento, that was a good film. And, I suppose, 'intelligent'. But by intelligent, I mean something that pushes boundaries of the viewer's understanding. I don't mean intelligent as in 1) able to do simple arithmetic, 2) develop reading and writing skills and 3) generally being one notch above a dolphin.OK, let's make a start shall we? Firstly, one of the greatest literary and cinematic arts is the use of metaphor. This film has none. One thing the film is full of is too much explanatory dialogue (not to mention pre-teen psychology - the father figure relationship in the subconscious). For example, in the first Matrix film, the viewer understands the profundity of what is being delivered through metaphor (a feature that the subsequent Matrix films sadly missed). In this film here, everything is painstakingly explained. To me, this speaks volumes.Secondly, great actors, yes. BUT ALL miscast and given appalling dialogue in an appalling script. I mean, Ellen Page was great in Juno, but here she comes out with painfully mechanical lines in the same way that Joseph Gordon-Levitt also does. In the same way that every character does. They ALL speak the same way and we are no better understanding one character by the end of the film than we were when they first appeared.Thirdly, logic. Philosophy. Call it what you want. Why was Ariadne chosen to become the architect? What does she actually DO??And Ken Watanabe. Why is he alive after dying on the third or fourth level 'down' in the subconscious after the film so adamantly stresses the dangers of dying in the 'dream'? How can he wake up on the plane?? Why, in fact, is there that scene at the start of the film where he appears old and which features the safe and the confidential papers Leonardo De Caprio finds.Why does Leonardo De Caprio constantly have to furrow his brow? Oh, yes, it's a vain attempt to look mean and manly because the poor man still has, unfortunately for him, such a baby face.Why is Cillian Murphy's character chosen to be their means of helping LDC's character get back to his kids? And isn't it convenient to have a dream sequence in a blockbuster that resembles a James Bond film snow-covered chase scene? Why does the film have to go on for two and a half hours instead of one and a half? And most importantly, if Leonardo De Caprio's character is so severely screwed up about his wife why, o why does he have to be the main character in this film? Couldn't the team work with someone more well-balanced?? Can he in fact be any use to his kids if he eventually finds them???Nonsense nonsense nonsense. Big pile of nonsensical psycho-babble.

While that movie bizarrely assumes that the Cold War still remains of interest to anyone (?), \"Inception\" insists basically that it\\'s interesting to watch other people\\'s dreams. Well, visually it can be - the \"architecture-bending\" style of \"Inception\" would have had great appeal, maybe in a 60-second advert for a credit card or mobile phone company.But visual appeal aside, the \"plot\" of the movie is not so much multi-layered as multi- pointless. The old cliché that \"if you die in dream you wake up\" is hauled out here with monotonous regularity, but it\\'s never applied consistently, and even if it were, who cares? If you MUST fire a machine gun at someone in a dream (and I can\\'t think of any reason why you\\'d really need to), why would you ever run out of bullets? Wouldn\\'t you just dream up some more? If you want to blow up a dream hotel, do you really NEED dream explosives? If the fuse goes out, is it safe to return, or should you always light the dreamy blue touchpaper and stand well back? The movie\\'s makers assume that multi-layering these various dream levels will be endlessly fascinating (as evidenced by the enormous running time), but anyone with an ounce of discernment will simply become less and less connected as the plot becomes \"deeper\".

Simulate as convincingly as you like, but you can\\'t change the laws of physics in the real world, and if you\\'re in a dream, then there\\'s no real need to worry about being stabbed or shot, and neither should the viewer care whether the characters are, or aren\\'t.The urban myth being put about that \"Inception\" includes some sort of interesting or unexpected ending is no more than that.For a witty, snappy meditation on alternative reality, try Cronenberg\\'s \"eXistenZ\", and (despite the fact that, like, when you\\'re dreaming you know, your life goes really slowly and, like, you can live a whole lifetime in the dreamy dream state, man) try to give this bloated waste of time a miss.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : First off, it\\'s clear that these IMDb ratings are no longer valid. This film was just \\'ok\\' by anyone\\'s standards, except maybe the plethora of teenagers that love anything that includes lots of gun fire and \\'splosions. The plot was unnecessarily convoluted and chock full of lazy writing. I have really liked Chris Nolan\\'s work, so this is not a personal attack on him; it\\'s just nowhere near as slick as others have claimed. The biggest symptoms of lazy writing are: constant exposition in the guise of conversation, constant changing of rules set up earlier in the movie and supposedly brilliant people making illogical choices, when the plot demands it. Many have said that those of us who didn\\'t like it were just clueless and didn\\'t \"get it\". What\\'s to get? The plot was not difficult to understand, just difficult to accept as anything that made any sense. A dream with a dream within a dream. Big effing deal! I bought this film on DVD and couldn\\'t wait to see it as so many people had hailed it as the best thing since Citizen Kane. I was left feeling empty and ripped off, then again, there is an entire generation that claims \"Transformers\" and \"Independence Day\" are two of the best films ever made. I fail to understand how this over-blown, over-hyped film could garner such high ratings unless the people doing the rating have never seen a movie over 20 ears old. The concept was high-minded but the execution was pure popcorn-munching tripe. While I\\'ll admit the cinematography was gorgeous and the acting was fairly well done, it was just so empty. As others have pointed out, when it\\'s all just a dream, there\\'s not a lot of tension when faceless people are shooting at you. Just plain silly, I say. (as an aside, South Park did a very funny dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream years ago!)\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : You have this basic idea and the story, they are very good. And boy did the have money. And the CGI is spectacular, yes.Further on this:Inception is constantly VERBALLY explaining what is happening, why it is happening, how it\\'s relating to things explained earlier and so on. The rules, the plot, the inner conflicts. Even at the 2/3rd of the movie, they are still explaining basic rules. I don\\'t see why this was necessary as most of it is repetition. You get the same stuff over and over again, supposed you didn\\'t get it for the first time. And again: VERBALLY. Exactly like in your average, random Venezuelan soap opera.Inception does almost not have any scenes. As far as I\\'m concerned, movies are about scenes. Here, you\\'ll only be able to remember certain sequences, because it\\'s all just one big a montage of sequences. It\\'s the montage of the master-plan from Oceans 11 for 150 minutes and it\\'s exaggerating.The score is non-stop blaring, all the darn time, even when people are just talking to each other, music is building up constantly to give you the perception, that there are serious things going on. It\\'s just annoying, painful for the ears and pointless. Generally important scenes are in no contrast to basic scenes. It\\'s one big video clip.Characters. I don\\'t remember a single name, as there is no kind of character development going on here. It\\'s just some well dressed people. All the dialog is used up, for basic explaining like \"for dummies\", rather then building character, relationships, or just being generally cool dialog. Occasional tries sounds like tag-lines or slogans while being just plain unintelligent. Also, this is leaving the actors no space to - well - act... which is a waste of the great cast.Now all these things are very amateur scriptwriting mistakes, or if you prefer: it\\'s a stupid movie. But no one seems to notice as Nolan does everything to convince you that you are watching something meaningful.The blaring music and the hectic editing, the fact that there are permanently 3 scenes of action cut together into one sequence underlined by an incredibly severe score, it\\'s just there to distract. Because in fact the movie has nothing new to show us. Separate the sequences and you have the most basic and outdated action b-movie there is. Car chase. Fire fight. Explosion. Present it confusing enough so it seems complex. Same goes for the plot. The rules of the dream world are not complicated at all, you are absolutely able to sum it up in two sentences, just try. The Matrix set up it\\'s world with a 10 minute sequence and we all got it where the whole theme is about equally, or more complex. Now Nolan is either deliberately confusing people for effect or simply because he doesn\\'t have the skills as a scriptwriter to set up a movie. Neither of the versions seems too noble, but I guess it\\'s a combination of those.Now the fact, that no one really seems to have noticed ALL THIS this is just a total riddle to me. Even famous film critics praise this movie as ground breaking and brilliant and I just can\\'t see, where I am totally stupid, or why I\\'d construe all these mistakes into the movie, when in reality, they just weren\\'t there.It\\'s just malpractice, as what you have here is basic movie making rules ignored in the most inelegant fashion possible and then compensating for it with - well - money. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s not knowing the rules and then breaking them, it just looks like not knowing the rules. It\\'s what you could expect a first year student at a mediocre film school to do where his teacher then asks him to start all over again, with the first book. And it\\'s just so \"in your face\". For most of the time, there is really nothing more then cutaways, the characters describing what is happening and Hans Zimmer smashing while you see expensive CGI and explosions.But everything just seems so damn serious and exclusive and the music is really dramatic. How could this movie not be good, right? But it\\'s a trick. It\\'s the concept of visceral over-stimulation brought to a new level and I\\'m shocked that it works to the point where after almost a century of film making THIS is regarded as one of the best movies of all time.IMDb TOT 250 #8.

       " \"Review of Inception : Ten years ago, Christopher Nolan wrote and directed the brilliant 'Momento', a stunning thriller that pushed the boundaries of storytelling convention. It was great, but still, one couldn't help wondering, where would Nolan go from here? How could he trump this achievement? In fact, although his subsequent films have been praised, they've been less distinctive, but with 'Inception', he returns to his adventurous roots, producing a story that is even more audacious than 'Momento'; and unfortunately, the result is dreadful. And worse than the fact that it doesn't really work is the fact that while it is distinctive, it is distinctive in a very conventional way. Since his early success, Nolan has taken work from big studios, and 'Inception' is no exception; and the result is a Hollywood movie straining desperately to stand out, instead of something more truly independent. in spirit.To make the point in more detail, 'Inception' features a starry cast (I'm, afraid for me, the casting of Leonardo diCaprio has become a clear sign of a poor film with pretensions); an implausibly attractive geeky female assistant; loads of expository dialogue (at one point, it is explained that someone is the most powerful media baron in the world – i.e. they appear to be so powerful that no-one had heard of them); fast pace and Jason Bourne style camera work; sub-'Matrix' style ideas about the nature of reality, superficially intriguing and certainly confusing, but of little philosophical depth; extraordinary special effects; and above all else, a plot comprising an incoherent sequence of random set-piece scenes that seems constructed to showcase said special effects rather than because it makes sense as a story. It may sound like an intriguing idea to have the cast simultaneously fighting for their lives in seven different nested dream-spaces, but in fact, it isn't; multiplying the threat to the heroes only reduces the dramatic impact of each one.To give Nolan credit, he has made a wholly cinematic film; you certainly couldn't imagine this in book form. Sadly it's very hard to imagine it as a screenplay either, or as any sort of story. And it was story, not special effects, that made 'Momento' great; and while that story was highly unusual, it made internal sense. But less is never more in Hollywood; and sadly, more is often just a mess.\\n\",\n",

Also Wordy, Incomprehensible Insertions about the Teams \"Method\" used here to Infiltrate and Control the Minds of Corporate Clients (now there is a group we can morally support).This is so Unnecessarily Complicated that it causes Viewer Fatigue, and by Proximation Sleepiness, early on and Waking Up or Recovering from that is not a Given.

The idea of being sent into someone's subconscious or dream state is fascinating but when it comes to the point that someone is sent into a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream it just becomes ridiculous and on this occasion it does not work. Christopher Nolan is a fine Director/screen writer with a tremendous back catalogue of movies and will no doubt add to this back catalogue with more gems as his career continues but Inception is not one of them. Not a terrible movie but not a good one either. If you want to waste an hour and forty odd minutes of your time then go ahead and watch it but there are far better movies that exist.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Review of Inception : I'll begin by saying that I have an inbuilt prejudice against films that seem to put cleverness or 'intelligence' ahead of entertainment value. Having read a lot about this film, I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but in fact was very disappointed to end up disliking it as much as I did.For me, the film lacked two essential elements of an entertaining movie - a coherent plot and sympathetic characters. The plot didn't really start to make any sense until about halfway through (far too late) and Leonardo di Caprio as the central character, Cobb, was competent but just didn't have the charisma to carry this kind of story. His wife's death was foreshadowed a lot in the early part of the film and I found I just didn't care how or why she died. None of the other characters came across as real people and their connection to Cobb was generally unclear to me. The impression was of good actors (like Tom Hardy) being basically wasted.I almost switched off the film after the first twenty minutes because its chaotic action seemed designed almost to alienate the viewer. It started to make some sense after that, but was still a long way from what a good film should be. The over-reliance on sudden loud noises (way above the level of the dialogue) in the first half was simply irritating.The film also seemed to have trouble obeying its own internal logic. Several reviewers have mentioned that there was no consistency in what is supposed to happen when a dreamer dies during a dream; I was unimpressed by the 'projections' in the dreams apparently having their own personalities and being capable of independent thought, although the script also had them as nothing more than figments of the dreamer's imagination.Yes, the film's settings and special effects were impressive, but that's really not what an evening out (or in) should be about. If the story and characterisations are lacking, then why bother watching at all?\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : The reality is that my summary basically sums up this movie. It has you questioning reality all the way through; in some ways similar to The Matrix, I suppose, although it's more obvious in this movie that there's questioning about reality to be done. This movie, however, lacks the philosophical/religious elements that The Matrix had, and stands as a pretty formulaic action type movie with the issues about reality thrown in.Essentially, this movie takes place within a dream - or within dreams to be more precise. That's the catch. Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb plays a man who has somehow figured out not only how to get into people's dreams but how to link various people into the same dream, so that the dream becomes reality. Some tragedy has befallen Cobb as a result of this, which is finally revealed, but it does take a while. Cobb and his team are hired by a Japanese businessman who wants them to get inside the dreams of one of his corporate rivals to convince him to break his company up, thus eliminating the rivalry. The move goes from there.It's a confusing movie. There aren't just two layers to it - reality and dream. There are actually multiple layers of various kinds of reality, as characters can enter into dreams within dreams, each successive layer becoming more and more removed from what reality really is - if you get the point. It's imaginative, but it is confusing as you try to sort the layers out. In all honesty, it's not a movie that especially appealed to me. DiCaprio's performance was good but nothing more and there were some really good special effects included in this. Aside from the dream inside a dream inside a dream gimmick, though, this stacks up as an action movie among action movies, and I didn't find it an especially noteworthy addition to the genre. A friend told me it's the sort of movie you have to watch 2 or 3 times to really get your head around it. I think I have a reasonable enough attention span, and if I can't get my head around a movie on the first watching, then it's unlikely I'm going to go back to it again. I will say that this is the sort of movie that's tailor made to produce sequels. The very last scene leaves everything wide open to continue exploring whether or not Cobb is actually back in reality. (Remember, the top was still spinning on the table as the last scene faded out.) The possibilities for sequels are virtually limitless. Everything is based on a dream or dreams. You could have anything from comedy to action to historical epic to outer space adventure and it would all make sense, because it's all a dream or dreams! Still, while I can have some appreciation for the ingenuity of the writers to come up with a story that has the potential to literally go on forever, I didn't find enough here to make me want to look at the inevitable sequels.\\n\",\n",

Had no idea who was doing what and why.I did understand the concept as I was prepared for it after hearing from so many people about the 'complex' script. But to me, it was plain stupid. The producers had money and wanted to use it in action sequence and special effects. Did those fit the plot? Not really. This movie didn't need much action, to be honest.

The bad rating I gave this movie has nothing to do with the actors\\' performances.I gave this a bad rating because the writing was just bad. The CONCEPT of the movie was excellent. When I first saw the trailer, my imagination went wild. The scope of where you could go and what you could do with a concept like inception in people\\'s dreams is almost endless.But, where did they run with it? Guns? Explosions? Grand Theft Auto? Matrix wannabe? These are the words that came to mind when I watched this.And the plot, if that\\'s what you call it, is nothing. It\\'s convoluted minus the imagination, mystery, and intelligence. It\\'s like they made it complicated so it could SEEM intelligent. But trust me, it\\'s not! About 1/2 to 2/3 into the movie, the ending became VERY predictable. Even so, I thought, \"It\\'s about the journey not the ending. Right?\" Except the journey sucked. How come everybody in this movie only dreams about automatic weapons? I know, I know. There are a bunch of explanations in the movie, but the explanations are terrible and not thorough enough to be believable. For example, the characters explain the assault weapons in the dreams by saying the subconscious had been militarized.What kind of stupid explanation is that? Am I supposed to take that seriously? It seems like the movie is just asking for an excuse to become a pseudo-Matrix action flick. Except the Matrix was much better than this.Well... What a waste of a good concept... but mindless action flicks can be fun, even when they continuously, pretentiously claim to be thought-provoking..... But then there\\'s the looooong drawn out mushy ending that breaks up the action and isn\\'t befitting an action flick at all.So, congratulations Hollywood.

The plot had more holes than a string vest.I found the first 20 mins dull at best, and was easily distracted (I actually paused the film and ordered a pizza/had a look at Twitter/read another message board...). I even restarted the film to give it another chance, but to no avail.Then for a whole 20 mins, it managed to keep my attention before leaving me again thinking 'why I am watching this?' for the next hour or so. I finally gave in with 45 mins to go when it turned into a Bond movie with snow skiing chases that appeared from nowhere.I didn't give a toss about the characters who did nothing to make me want to care, the plot didn't fill more than a few minutes of the 145 mins I stayed with it and bar a few nice CGI tricks - I can't say there was anything not done better in other movies many times over and in a great deal less time.Give me Total Recall for dream based plots and action any day of the week.The acting was average, the architect looked 17yrs old yet somehow became an instant expert in dreams/psychology and managed to be smug - was she the token precocious child that all writers include when their stories are dying on the page? Perhaps a cute pet dog would have helped here.It isn't often that I switch a film off because I think its pointless to carry on. Inception didn't even annoy me enough to see what happened at the end - I simply didn't care. How this is getting anything over a 6/10 is beyond me.

The performances were very lackluster and the actors all (except for Tom Hardy) looked like they were performing in their sleep.There was no reason for any of the characters to be involved in this plan from a personal motivation reason, and their behaviours were completely arbitrary. Did they get paid for their time or was there some other reason to what they were doing in this scheme with the main character? I felt no connection or empathy for the main character or his motivation. There was no sense of unreality or mystery one would expect in a dream.

Okay, I exaggerate a little. But... Read the insightful reviews dated 19 July: You Don\\'t Get It. And 20 July: Boring, Too Long, Awful Dialogue. And 21 July: Not Bad But Definitely Not Genius. And 29 July: Dumb, Dumb, Dumb. And finally, for a little fun, 23 July: Blah. Rather than rehash the insights of those helpful reviews, I\\'ll try to add something useful...Inside of 30 minutes I was squirming in my seat, tapping my fingers, and checking my watch. Why? No character development. No sense that a good story had been started. And thus no engagement. As time wore on I found I really didn\\'t care about any of the characters, or their plights, or what they were trying to accomplish, other than thinking Ellen Page was kind of cute.In an EW interview, Nolan says about his film, Memento, that he was \"trying to transcend the tyranny of linear narrative.\" Really? A tyranny? We live in a linear narrative, Chris, but now that I know you feel that way about life, I\\'ll remember not to pay to see your films. In the same interview, Nolan says that he was worried that his audience wouldn\\'t be able to follow his brain-bending movie because of the complex dream-within-a-dream plot... until he lit upon (drum roll) the \"heist-flick model,\" in which the hero-thieves explain their scheme. Yes, Chris, but that\\'s not a very good model. And what\\'s more, it only works if the \"explaining is minimal\" and the director is skilled enough to show and reveal more. It\\'s a moving picture, remember? Yes, the action here is pretty cool, better than the Dark Knight. The camera and stunt work are very good. The music is the same gloomy heavy-handed kind used in Dark Knight (same composer, Hans Zimmer). But the characters are essentially two-dimensional because everything is secondary to the plot, which in spite of its complexity you can understand well enough because it\\'s all explained to you, endlessly. Even Dicaprio wasn\\'t happy with his character and worked with Nolan for two months \"adding layers\" for more emotional depth (see the Rolling Stone interview). But apparently the complexity and ridiculousness of the plot buried that, or Nolan just didn\\'t know how to deliver it (come to think of it, this may be a problem with all of his films). Plot over character. Cool factor over emotion. You think of the great work DiCaprio did in The Aviator. And the brilliant work by Gordon-Levitt in The 500 Days of Summer. I wasn\\'t much of a fan of Juno, but Ellen Page \"made\" that movie. And of course Michael Caine has made many great movies, including the recent Harry Brown. Also, Ken Watanabe in The Last Samurai. And finally, let\\'s not forget Marion Cotillard\\'s stunning Oscar-winning performance in La Vie En Rose. But they\\'re all struggling mightily here with Nolan\\'s tedious script, and their immense talent is wasted.But of course, I\\'m all wrong. The movie is a huge hit. It\\'s sure to rack up $500 million or more in worldwide box office sales. Whew! That\\'s good news. Because then Nolan can go on \"transcending the tyranny.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : *MAJOR SPOILER ALERT* The biggest problem with Inception was that I had no incentive to care about any of the characters or what happened to them. Other then built in pathos (dead wife guilt issues? Check. Daddy issues? Check? Missing your family? Check) there was no real drama or tension to the piece. At the end I really didn\\'t think for more than 2 seconds about whether the totem tipped or not. Because it made no difference one way or the other. I was in no way invested in Leo\\'s character.Another disturbing part of the film for me was the notion that even given the damage caused by Leo\\'s character\\'s first use of inception (on his wife) he was perfectly willing to do it again. I found all of the characters morally repugnant and was rooting for them to fail. Problematic as well is the attempt by the film maker to introduce stakes for actions only to immediately blot them out. At one point someone asks Leo if killing the baddies is damaging the psyche of the subject. A simple \"no\" suffices and it is never brought up again. For what reason was it even brought up then?The film also doesn\\'t bear up to scrutiny. The world of Inception didn\\'t play by its own rules and as a result all the wind came out of the film\\'s sails. During the van chase there was tension, if they crash they will be kicked out of the deeper layers. Then the van DOES crash (with lots of rolling/tipping) and this isn\\'t a kick? It took all the tension out of later scenes. Also when the target gets shot, which up to that point was presented as lights out Leo spouts one line of expository dialogue and everything isn\\'t kaput? We aren\\'t very far from Captain Kirk suggesting a tachyon pulse.The most glaring fault, however, was that despite how it was couched in terms of psychology and mental representation, the producers and director clearly had the Sparknotes on Freud and the publishers blurb on Lacan. Even an action-schlock genre film like Avatar had more psychological content than this \"thriller.\" Inception is a bloated mass of CGI and MacGuffins with nothing to say and nothing for me to care about.\\n',\n",

It's a science fiction film that takes dream analysis to several new levels. In the film, it's Leonardo DiCaprio's job to put his clients to sleep, then enter their dream subconscious and find out information they need. It gets much more complicated, but for the sake of saving your brain, that's the plot in a nutshell.Nolan recruited an all-star supporting cast, including Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in one of his first dramatic roles. While everyone tries very hard to give serious, dramatic performances to thrill and move the audience, it doesn't always come across that way. Marion seems like she's trying to remember how to speak English, Joe seems like he's desperately trying to get the audience to forget he was ever in 3rd Rock from the Sun, and Leo looks like he's out of tears and thinks a wrinkled face will be just as convincing.The special effects of the film absolutely deserved the hype and the Academy Award, as scenes literally bend and crumble into one another as the different dream sequences blend. If you love movies with incredible special effects, this is a must-see.If you even mention the title to anyone who's seen it, it'll no doubt spark an hour long discussion about what the story and ending meant. I watched the film, and with the exception of a couple of little details during the dream-within-a-dream sequences, I understood it perfectly. To me, the ending was not one that needed discussion, so I don't quite understand the reason behind everyone's endless debates.

If you know anything about what they try to make up you will start laughing or continue to watch and hope for the good stuff to start. The action was good and the movie definitely has it\\'s moments but I couldn\\'t \"enjoy\" it until the last hour.Watch it if you can be easily pursued into a poorly presented idea, believe it and be drawn into it. And there seems to be nothing else worth watching right now - unless you check some aspiring independent movies.Don\\'t watch it if you like sci-fi that is believable and passionate. This one is one lame attempt -or just a blown up money grab. As overrated as Batman.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Inception indeed has all the marks of a bad film. This is not just apparent in the film itself, but comments fan make.\"If you don\\'t like this movie, it\\'s because you don\\'t get it!\" \"If you don\\'t like this movie, you lack class!\"These sorts of things are the same things I hear when one of my hipster friends gives me a CD of some band nobody\\'s heard of, and when I press Play, I immediately figure out why. When you like a movie that is identifiably bad, you have to come up with excuses for liking it that aren\\'t tomfoolery, like \"you just don\\'t get it, MAN. It\\'s too ironic for your puritanical tastes!\"In the end, I find that the film itself, fans aside, is not terribly thrilling. The ideas aren\\'t original—it was like a Matrix in the dream world. Except a bad one, because nothing gets explained, really. Watching Inception was like watching the story of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 play out. The question I kept asking myself was \"okay, why is so-and-so doing THAT?\" At the end of the movie, I decided that Christopher Nolan, like George Lucas, is talented, but has gotten too full of himself. Why do I care about Cobb\\'s kids, to whom we are granted no real introduction? Why do I care about dueling energy companies? Why do I care about a bunch of corporate hit men and mob bosses? There\\'s no connection.An emotional connection is something lacking, but more frustratingly is the disappearance of character development about 15 minutes in. Everything gets lost at about that point actually. The logic of the plot, the coherence of the plot, everything. It\\'s baffling to me. I loved The Dark Knight and The Prestige—they hit that sweet spot in between baffling and straightforward. Inception missed the mark horribly.——SPOILERS DO NOT CROSS——By far, the ending is the most ridiculous. It\\'s a contradictory ending. Although we see the top is clearly falling, and Cobb is not wearing his ring, the children look the same as they did.——SPOILERS DO NOT CROSS——\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Before Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to play the lead part in \\'Inception\\', he spent months with Christopher Nolan trying to improve the script. It was at DiCaprio\\'s insistence that the part he was playing, Cobb, the corporate dream extractor, had to have a more beefed up internal arc. Otherwise, Inception would turn out to be another shallow, action adventure thriller. Despite Cobb\\'s triumph over his internal demons (particularly the way in which he expunges his dead wife, who has been haunting him in his subconscious), Inception is much more an exploration of the mechanics of dreaming than a chronicle of emotional catharsis. At the basic level, Inception can be divided into four distinct parts: Intro, Exposition, Journey and Resolution. The Intro consists of the initial scene, a flashback where Cobb must save his employer, a sleazy Japanese businessman, Saito, now far advanced in years, who has been stuck in a limbo-like purgatory for decades, unaware that he was mortally wounded in someone else\\'s dream. It\\'s a nice, little compact scene where we see a near-dead Cobb, washed up on a beach and dragged into Saito\\'s fortress compound. A gun is left on the table in front of Saito and we\\'re trying to figure out whether Saito is going to kill Cobb or himself. Cut to the next scene where Cobb and his associate are involved in a trying to extract information from a much younger Saito inside one of his dreams, as they all sleep on a bullet train somewhere in Japan. Apparently, Saito was expecting the dream extractors and informs them that this is their \\'audition\\'; the extractors\\' \\'architect\\', the guy in charge of designing the dreamworld, somehow lets things get out of control when a mob of men invade the room where they\\'re all staying, and Saito later has his thugs toss the architect off the roof of a heliport. Despite the botched job, Saito is impressed that Cobb and his partner are able to move through different \\'levels\\' in the dreamworld. Cobb\\'s \\'audition\\' could have been compressed into one or two minutes but Nolan insists on illustrating every aspect of his convoluted plot. We finally arrive at the film\\'s inciting incident: Saito\\'s proposal to Cobb that he enter the dream world of his business rival, Fischer, and plant a suggestion in his subconscious, leading to the dissolution of the rival\\'s entire business empire. \\'Inception\\' is the reverse of what Cobb and his team have been trained to do—extracting information and Cobb has doubts about successfully carrying out Saito\\'s proposal. But when Saito promises to pull some strings, enabling Cobb to return to the United States, despite murder charges hanging over his head, Cobb can\\'t resist jumping at the chance to see his two children again.The next part of \\'Inception\\', the \\'exposition\\', takes about an hour. This is where Cobb assembles his new carefully selected \"Mission Impossible\" superstar team who will penetrate Fischer\\'s mind and plant the suggestion to break up his dying father\\'s business empire. Nolan\\'s explanation of the mechanics of the dreamworld is so complicated, that he has Cobb explain it to his new architect, a naive graduate student who manages to acquit herself rather well despite facing major obstacles inside multiple dreamworlds. Nolan manages to violate a major tenet of screen writing technique: Show don\\'t tell. Unfortunately, during these expository sequences, there\\'s a lot more \\'tell\\' than \\'show\\'. Yes, there is a rather neat scene (reminiscent of an M. C. Escher illustration), where one Paris landscape folds on top of another but most of the visuals are much more mundane: for example, a speeding locomotive appears out of nowhere during a car chase on a Paris street.Much has been written about the \\'journey\\' aspect of \\'Inception\\'. Critics seem to be impressed by the three dreamworlds the \\'dream team\\' penetrates, coupled with the way in which they\\'re able to return to reality—the so-called \\'kicks\\', where a huge sound or explosion propels them through the different levels back up to the surface. Nolan, however, serves up some of the dullest and derivative landscapes that our \\'heroes\\' must navigate through—in fact, these so-called dreams don\\'t look like dreams at all. Take Level 1—just a typical shoot em up with faceless bad guys chasing the \\'good guys\\'. As for level 2—I felt I was watching a parody of Space Odyssey, with our dreamers floating through a hotel without the benefit of gravity. Finally, I have heard \\'Level 3\\', compared to \\'Ice Station Zebra\\', the schlocky 60s action film set in the Arctic.Inception\\'s Resolution is as unsatisfying as the earlier parts of the film. What are we to make of Cobb? Just because he has made this deal with Saito and it enables him to see his children, does not mitigate the fact that the whole plan to literally change Fischer\\'s mind, is reprehensible. After all, shouldn\\'t have Cobb walked away when Saito had his men murder the first architect? Cobb, by and large, remains a tainted and unsympathetic character, precisely because he looks the other way when he\\'s quite aware that Saito has committed murder.We\\'re also told (by Saito) that the breakup of Fischer\\'s empire is a good thing but should we take his word for it? He\\'s a thug and Nolan has provided us nothing to go on to evaluate the nature of the Fischer empire. Finally, why does Fischer cry at his father\\'s deathbed? He\\'s just learned that his father put his mother in a mental institution so shouldn\\'t he be angry? Or are those tears of joy so that he can be now \\'his own man\\'?The bulk of \\'Inception\\' is merely a pastiche of mediocre action adventure espionage thrillers dating back to the 60s when the genre was in full bloom. The long-winded \\'B\\' story, Cobb\\'s tortured machinations in trying to literally kick his dead wife out of his subconscious mind, merely serves to distract us from the hollowness of the overall plot.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Unless you call this movie a masterpiece. Then you are.Damn 1,000 word limit. Gotta make this quick.Spoilers.The film is 2.5 hours long, yet feels like 5.2, and there are a few reasons for this. One of which is the fact that a preponderance of the first act is amateurish, conflict-free exposition, which does not bode well for repeat viewings.The \"learning about the dream world\" scene is atrocious. No conflict. Both Leo and Page\\'s characters already knew what was being explained. The similar \"learning about the matrix\" scene in The Matrix did it right by having one character not know anything. Plus, there was conflict. Neo gets his ass kicked and fails to make the building jump. Much more entertaining.There\\'s another problem with the whole section of bending the landscape where Leo explains the negative aspects of altering the dream world. The closest we get to seeing the dream world altered was Leo becoming Mr. Charlie, yet the most that happens then is a bunch of extras turn and look at Leo. That\\'s it. The idea was not exploited. You literally have to go out of your way to miss that opportunity. Hell, that Mr. Charles scene is shorter than the scene that explains why altering the dream world is bad! Let\\'s not forget this whole idea of one corporation one-upping another has absolutely no personal ramifications for anyone on screen or in the audience. It would have greatly amped up the internal conflict if Leo had to struggle with the notion that helping the guy who could help him would endanger someone else close to him, or us, or someone else. ANYTHING could have worked better than an energy contract that means less to me than my neighbor\\'s bath mat. Come on. The totems were handled very poorly. All we need to know is their purpose. We don\\'t need to know anything else, yet the film keeps piling on needless information.If this is a heist film, where is the threat of being caught? A van falls for an endless amount of time. Joseph Gordon-Levitt floats bodies down a hallway for half an hour, real-time. The guy from Bronson does his thing, whatever the hell that was. These are not complex tasks or events, but rather straight-forward in nature. Dragging them out for a solid chunk of the film is what creates the glacial pace and makes a long film seem even longer.Inception has no real villain. You can make a case for Cotillard, but she is an internal enemy. She never takes a \"physical\" presence and never threatens anyone except Leo. Everyone else is dealing with faceless assassins. That makes it feel distant from the rest of the action. It doesn\\'t even have anything to do, emotionally, with Leo\\'s goal of getting home to see his kids. None of this is tied together. Leo didn\\'t even know what the hell was going on with Cillian and never even knew of the outcome until after the fact. He\\'s separated from the physical manifestation of his goal for a majority of the film. I ended up not caring if the plan succeeded. If it was all somehow tied together, the audience would be able to experience that great emotional catharsis that everyone was talking about...but that didn\\'t happen.In fact, Leo is so separated from the actual plot that you can literally put Levitt in his place and not even need the hero in the dream world at all! Hell, you can even put Page there, since all she does after designing the boring and lifeless dream worlds is hang out with the guys and tell Leo he\\'s crazy. I really wish she had something else to do besides play the part of the fifth wheel.Leo\\'s lack of involvement in the main action of the story creates a \\'so what?\\' moment when the problem is solved for him, and I can think of absolutely no reason why the hero should not be the one to conquer the main conflict. Brody kills the shark in Jaws. He doesn\\'t send Hooper and Quint out to do his dirty work while he stays behind to deal with his fear of water. It\\'s integrated. The hero is forced into dealing with the physical, and in turn, but learn to conquer his internal fears before he can conquer his external opponent. This is Screen writing 101, Lesson 1, and Nolan got that wrong. That\\'s why I don\\'t believe the reports that he spent 10 years writing the script since it only took me 148 minutes to figure out exactly what was wrong with it.Not to mention the conceit that to enter someone else\\'s dream and control it means that you would have to control your own subconscious, which they state elsewhere is impossible. Way to go, genius.Pretty much everything this film does wrong, The Matrix does right. Watch that instead.PS: The \\'taking a scene from the middle and putting it at the beginning\\' gag reached its peak effectiveness in 2002 and has absolutely no place in modern films. It\\'s getting as bad as that tired old \\'It\\'s all a dream\\' scenario. Oh, wait...\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Boring movie with no meaning and only a few fancy special effects. Special effects were not even all that good. Just a few slow motion anti-gravity scenes. Even the Matrix would have been boring without some kind of \"meaning of life\" stuff. You need more than star power to make a good movie. I kept thinking the movie would have intriguing thought provoking idea, but it was so predictable. It turned into a real snooze. The premise of the movie is not enough to carry the entire movie. Using dreams to influence behavior is a concept that has been used many times effectively. Such as SG-1 when the Harcesus teaches Daniel that power would corrupt him through a dream. But this movie has no uplifting message.\\n',\n",

I am checking out numerous films people recommend as 'best of 2010' to me.Inception was waaaaay too shallow for me. It's a superficial action film that admittedly looks visually nice, but there's no real drama. It actually bored me.

I was expecting something amazing given the extremely high IMDb rating - couldn't have been more disappointed with this movie.The special effects were good, but apart from that, I think the film didn't work particularly well and it's totally over-rated.The acting was nothing amazing and the story is not as clever as it pretends to be. I agree with some other reviewers on here, that this film passes itself off as being very intelligent and clever but only for people who don't have any intelligence and are easily pleased.I like Nolan's other work - Dark Knight was excellent, however, this movie is nowhere near as good and felt pretty lame.I think a lot of people who don't even understand this movie, just gave it a high rating assuming it was a clever movie when it actually wasn't that good at all.This movie is certainly 'not' a masterpiece or anything even close. It felt like a Matrix wannabe, but I have to say The Matrix blows this movie out of the water by a huge margin.As I write this review, this movie is currently in the top 3 movies of all time?? I've never been more shocked - get real people. It seems the film companies are paying people to vote on here and boost their films - there can be no other explanation. Very disappointing and was expecting so much more from this movie. Don't bother paying to see it in the cinema as you will feel let down.\\n\",\n",

Leonardo has made some great films, but after Shutter Island I became less of a fan. I rate Shutter Island only slightly better, but both are a let down for me. I am sure lots of people will dislike my take on this over hyped film, what kills the story for me, it has all these different layers inside layers, sure the idea is O.K but it is not very well done in this film, just one big mess of special effects, that leaves me just feeling very flat.

       " \"Review of Inception : For the amount of effort that went into this production, I found the result to be ultimately pretty dull. Like nearly 99% of what has come out of Hollywood in the past 15 years or so, this film has loads of technique but little heart. It offers little to care for, and therefore little to remember.Yes, there's some fancy graphics, but that's about it. The internal logic of the nested dreams is routinely disrupted, the action sequences don't make much sense (why all the shooting, really?) and none of the characters are emotionally involving. Di Caprio's character has a nominal story arc at best, and the angst he's supposed to feel is not grounded because we don't know neither his nor his wife's history, or how they got together.Yes, Inception is a fun mind game. But like most mind games, it ultimately doesn't make for a worthwhile experience. And at 2.5 hours this mind game is far too overblown. Its lack of proportion (too much talk, too many levels, too much trivial action, complicated for the sake of complicated) unfortunately makes things worse. The incessant music, typical of Zimmer, is trivially repetitive, as are much of the action sequences. Ultimately these become much more intrusive and annoying as the film progressives.When I compare this film to older ones, like The Woman in the Window, which achieves so much more of a memorable experience and story, yet with so little, one has to wonder if technology and truckloads of cash are getting in the way of memorable storytelling.This film would have fared much better as a comedy, or maybe as round-table discussion about dreams, or maybe as a survey of a Facebook clique of friends sharing dreams. But the film needed to have far more fantasy to really evoke the sensation of dreamscapes. And most importantly, it needed a far more soulful and compelling story with characters we are allowed to learn about and therefore care about.\\n\",\n",

See Shutter Island, for example. And he is better than this. I think this movie was made for adolescent boys. In the screening I saw they made up 2/3 of the audience. And they loved it. But I didn't hear any girls or women praising it. Altogether the cast was very good but they had little to do except go with the narrative. And it's a poor narrative. Boo.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : INCEPTION The dialogue in this film is preoccupied with explaining what is happening, rather than being natural. This is very possibly due to the director feeling the concept of the film was too complicated for mere cinema goers to comprehend and instead of enhancing the film as a good flowing natural dialogue might it in fact has a tendency to spoil the film. It is also very repetitive, continually repeating the rules of inception, the inner workings of the dream construction. It becomes very annoying and I\\'m sure Inception holds the world record for saying the word \\'dream\\' more times than any other.There is a concept in teaching, developed by the Americans which goes like this, tell the people what you are going to teach them, then teach it to them, then tell them what is was you just taught them. It seems the director has adopted this method of explaining to the audience, just in case they are too stupid to get it for themselves, what the film is about and what is happening.Di Caprio who in my opinion is a talented actor that often picks challenging roles was neither commanding nor outstanding. Partly due to the lack of any real structure to the film as the whole thing seemed too fluid and poured out in a tsunami of CGI. Additionally there is no kind of character development, something Di Caprio is generally masterful at, leaving the film feeling hollow and a waste of an otherwise talented cast. Something Hollywood studios will often do when trying to portray highly intelligent criminals (or evil masterminds) is cast British actors, and it is noticeable in Inception that director Christopher Nolan has not broken away from the stereotype.A previous reviewer wrote \"The stupid dialog is there, because Nolan did not know, how to push the plot forward in an integrated way\" and i totally agree.I\\'ve heard a lot about how Inception is the new Matrix and I must confess I have never watched Matrix, I did sit down and try, on three occasions to do so, but all three times i fell asleep out of sheer boredom. That is not sarcasm it is real. I know the Matrix story as it\\'s so well known, whether or not Inception is the new Matrix i cannot say but I can confess it\\'s a fairly redundant mediocre film with an over contrived plot strung together by cliché action scenes. The plot concept is not so difficult to comprehend and seems to be hyped up for what it really is.

But beside dreams, this movie is nothing but a collage of scenes with major capitol cities; crime involves rich person dying; repetitive, half ass architectural and interior designs, and of course, endless people and car chasing plus everlasting fights..this movie is a combo of many movies, you don't need to see this movie if you have seen some of the followings: 80's James Bonds, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Memento, butterfly effect, Ronin, the day after tomorrow (another really lousy movie)..., the worst thing is many scenes in Inception are quite directly replicated from those movies.the art design of the movie is terrible, I can see the art director only knows M.C.

Also I keep wondering about this: considering 5 minutes equal one hour per layer of a dream, do those people feel thirsty or wanting to go to the bathroom in their 50 year long dreams?For people saying that we should have some imagination to appreciate this movie, I truly believe that these people are just finding excuses for this movie and for themselves too. sorry I just can't stare at a pile of crap and imagine that's filet mignon :p\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : \"Inception\" seems to be taking the premises of such films as \"Peter Ibbetson,\" \"Altered States,\" \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" to more elaborate lengths. Throughout this action flick – and that is what it truly is, despite its pretenses – I couldn\\'t help thinking of the most recent James Bond thriller in which I lost track of who was who among the secondary characters because the identities they started with were revealed as false, but then the revelation itself was proved equally false (or at least dubious), to the point where you couldn\\'t believe a word they were saying and ultimately you ceased to care. With \"Inception\" we get a lot of technical jabbering from the mouths of Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page about what everything means or might mean as they \"share\" and \"engineer\" other people\\'s dreams in order to infiltrate their subconscious to achieve their corporate goals. These dream states are filled with the usual action staples of racing and crashing vehicles, explosions and the liberal use of automatic weapons, accompanied here by huge crumbling cityscapes (less effective than the more modest melting away of various smaller environments in \"Eternal Sunshine\"). There is nothing particularly dreamy about writer-director Christopher Nolan\\'s dream world; aside from a few interesting computer-generated images like a whole city appearing to fold over upon itself, none of the effects stick in the mind or affect the viewer\\'s juices. Marion Cotillard contributes her trademark broken heartedness. Page gives the same performance we are familiar with from her telesystems commercials. Cillian Murphy emotes richly as the kidnapped son of an energy industry magnate. The heaving score by Hans Zimmer sounds like hundreds of others.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : Having read a couple of glowing initial critics\\' reviews for this movie, I ventured out to catch Inception on its opening weekend. I wouldn\\'t call myself a regular movie-goer and I usually prefer to wait and get some positive feedback on a movie before I invest my time and money. I felt confident that Inception would be worth both. I was wrong. This movie is so heavy on confusing, superficial action, yet void of any emotional connection, that it\\'s difficult to remain attentive to it. Fortunately, even though the movie is overly long at 2.5 hours, the initial scenes give you an indication pretty early on whether it is your kind of movie or not. If you can grasp the first 15-20 minutes or so, and like what you see, then you may enjoy the movie or at least find it somewhat intriguing; if not, I can assure you it doesn\\'t get any better, and you will feel confused and jilted by the end. I won\\'t go into the plot - that has been delved into and debated in numerous previous reviews; suffice it to say, it\\'s very convoluted, \"layered\" and needs your rapt attention. Nothing really, in my mind, stands out as being its saving grace. The acting is adequate but, again, the characters are not developed to the point where you really have any feelings for their ultimate fates. The special effects, save for the hallway zero gravity fight scene, are nothing out of the ordinary. The movie jumps around a lot, and DeCaprio\\'s reoccurring interaction with his late wife is particularly annoying and confusing (what\\'s a dream and what\\'s reality?). I left the theatre wondering what all the buzz was about, although the majority of attendees at my showing had the same reaction as myself. I came home and checked out this site and, again, wondered what the heck I was missing in this movie that made it so spectacular,a \"masterpiece\" according to some. Now, a couple of weeks later, I see more realistic and accurate reviews and am gratified to know that I am neither insane nor stupid. This movie is obviously geared demographically to a youthful audience and/or those who consider themselves aficionados of this genre. I honestly think some have talked themselves into believing all the hype about this movie. Personally, I\\'m just relieved to know that I am not that far off the mark about this film.

       " 'Review of Inception : I will start by saying that Inception does indeed have a clever premise, or at least one that sounds good on paper: A group of people who steal information from people\\'s dreams are hired to put an idea in someone\\'s head. Cobb\\'s back story and the way he was haunted by his mental image of his ex-wife was genuinely fascinating. However, all of these nice, fresh ideas are lost in a hurricane of absolutely awful and pretentious storytelling. People have often praised this film for having clever writing, but it strikes me that the film is just deliberately trying to be needlessly complicated to appear smarter than it really is. I say \"needlessly\" because, when you get right down to it, the overall plot of Inception is not all that complex, so the film just comes across as pretentious.One of the first problems I had with the film is something I thought was present in Christopher Nolan\\'s Batman films to a lesser extent (but those films had the benefit of having straightforward story lines and memorable characters): We are presented to a concept that could never happen in real life. That\\'s not the problem. The problem is that the film delivers its ludicrous plot in such a straight-faced dead serious manner that it breaks my willing suspension of disbelief. In a film that took itself slightly less seriously, I might not wonder as much about where the technology to travel into someone\\'s dreams came from, but here, it just begs for an explanation. If the film weren\\'t trying to have a realistic atmosphere, I might buy that you can do this by injecting chemicals into your arm, then dream up more chemicals to travel into dreams within dreams, but here, it just comes across as absolute nonsense.None of the characters in the film, with the possible exceptions of Cobb, Mal and Fischer, were interesting or memorable in the least. In fact, most of the characters don\\'t really even feel like people as much as they feel like soulless chess pieces that exist only for the purpose of advancing the plot. As a result of this, I could not have cared less about what was happening in the film, and towards the action sequences at the end, I was on the verge of falling asleep. I\\'m sorry, but watching people with no personalities battling generic gun wielding masses (who, in a stunning lack of originality, are apparently supposed to represent Fischer\\'s subconscious) just isn\\'t entertaining.Bottom line, Inception is a boring, pretentious and rather nonsensical film. It has a nice premise that sounds good on paper, which is why I really expected to like it, but found it a letdown.\\n',\n",

       " \"Review of Inception : This movie is completely overrated. Just because they's going into people's dreams does not make this film intelligent, and it does not compensate for the bad plot and underdeveloped characters. I found myself just wanting it to be over an hour into it. I had no problem understanding the concept, i just thought it was nothing exceptional. Let's not only enter one dream but enter three! It was completely ridiculous. I realize that it was a movie and they don't necessarily have to be realistic but i think the idea to enter three dreams was just a sad attempt to make the movie have more depth and fake complexity. This film easily could have been shortened down if it didn't have the unnecessary dragged out gun fights. When ever a new gun fight came up i would grown knowing i'd have to sit and watch it for another twenty minutes or so. They never developed the characters to make you feel bad for them if they died or got hurt. I even thought while watching how much i wouldn't care if they got stuck in the dream forever and went into limbo or whatever, as long as it ends soon and i can leave! I would never have thought that if they would have made the characters relatable and not so indulgent. The movie itself took itself a little too seriously also. I got a vibe the whole time just with the over dramatic music and over the top effects that the people who made it obviously thought too highly of it which i never find appealing. The only reason i give this movie any stars at all is for the cinematography and acting. Otherwise this movie is just an overrated indulgent film that is just pitiful attempt to call a 9/10 star movie. Pathetic.\\n\",\n",

Yes for some reason I feel personally insulted by this. Is this because I was expecting the world after the great reviews and was truly disappointed? Was it the fact that I believe most feel the movie wasn't that great but are jumping on the bandwagon?

I do not think I have such problems, especially with movies so naive and pretentious such as this total fiasco that instead of passing for masterpiece in film history should find its place in the panorama of biggest failures in film history, together with much more valuable movies that went overlooked.The way Nolan-who must take himself for a genius-heads for the dream world is superfluous, nonpoetic, mechanistic, and incoherent(he jumps from one idea to another leaving them all in suspense and we are supposed to buy that this reflects the nature of the plot).Perhaps his original idea was an interesting one but he needed a scriptwriter to make something of it.He preferred to do it all by himself, filling the story with clichés and dialogues so stupid that they are unbearable to watch and listen to.There is no philosophical background, only a pretentious plot that is supposed to mean something, and most of all it is aiming at impressing the audience, and in that it succeeded perfectly.I consider it a blasphemy to put Inception next to 2001 or Blade runner;instead I would suggest a comparison with David Cronenberg's Existenz;it's not Cronenberg's best film but it gives Nolan a lesson what messing with another reality means.Finally, I understand that these views I expose here are about to be the target of attack by many devoted fans.I can not but accept this position.PS. I am heading for Intersterlar one of these days, I never learn;I already read people are in love with this movie too.I hope I fall in love too, but I have great reservations as I do not trust the director at all!I'll be back, however, with another review, since I've decided to fight for what I consider right these days(and to support great films I still have the pleasure to watch,like- very recently- the Judge and the Drop)\\n\",\n",

Just something to consider as you read this.As for the movie, I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did, however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films, I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special effects.

       " 'Review of Inception : In my opinion the IMDb review by Carl_Tait from New York, NY is about the best summation of the film. A great concept but lost in translation. And to think Mr. Nolan wrote the story for \"Inception\"!!! I include \"Inception\" among the film genre that have come to be known as \"mind**ck\" films. I don\\'t agree with every list of films characterized thus on the web but this is an unmistakable genre. And \"Inception\" definitely belongs there.I suspect there are a lot of viewers out there who see a complex but convoluted film and find it gripping because BAM!! it hits them so hard on the head that they dare not concede they don\\'t understand it because they are afraid someone will find out that they didn\\'t :-) But there are a number of IMDb reviewers who have given \"Inception\" 10/10 or close to that rating. The way these reviewers have articulated their reasoning is definitely more comprehensible and cogent than the film is in my opinion. I wish Mr. Nolan had consulted them before making the film as I am sure they could bring some clarity to the mix.To my mind \"Inception\" has a convoluted and twisted narrative (if there is one) which *seems* multi-layered, but actually throws just about everything it can into the mix, never mind the sink, it throws in even the kitchen itself. I will say that the CGI effects are pretty amazing. But the film is overpopulated with characters and it was hard to figure out why more than half of them were there.And as another reviewer commented, what the heck are the guns and explosions doing in a film based on a shared dream paradigm.\"Inception\" gave me no reason to care for any of the characters, excepting to some degree Ellen Page\\'s character Ariadne. I had no reason to care for Marion Cotillard\\'s character Mal, and found her portrayal somewhat of a female stereotype playing the neurotic unhinged foil.I am sure Mr. Nolan is an excellent film maker who has definitely come into his own as far as the box office is concerned. But so far the only films he has done that I have truly admired are \"Insomnia\" and \"Batman Begins\". Before \"Batman Begins\" I was never a fan of any of the Batman films.While watching \"Inception\" there was many a time that I felt like stopping and watching something else but gave it the benefit of doubt that the film might pick-up. Sorry to say it never did.I do hope Mr.Nolan gives a little more attention to maintaining a narrative and character development in his films rather than just bombarding us with complexity (or more accurately confusion!) and CGI effects.All I can say is that \"Inception\" is exhausting viewing and represents complexity for the sake of complexity or something like that.....\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : While it seems ingenious to invent a cunning conceit such as the one deployed in this film it is like a novel that uses neologisms and errant grammar and punctuation: it\\'s effects tire and it seems less than it wishes it to be.The dramaturgy and logic of Inception is very simple and relies on a \\'reductio\\' argument which is quite clear within 10 minutes,(and is absurd because of the logical impossibility of the argument itself like Wittgenstein\\'s proof against skepticism) but it\\'s true failing is not that: it is in fact the use of change and sudden effects as plot devices because once employed they heighten awe but kill any suspense or connection with the characters in the film. There is no reason or emotion in caring about characters that are chaff in a rather ordinary logician\\'s game.Years ago Thomas Pynchon was considered an important writer, and the author and critic (and sometime film critic) Peter Ackroyd wrote an astute review of his major work, \"Gravity\\'s Rainbow\", in which he ridiculed the ease of such writing; it\\'s deceptive cleverness; it\\'s egoism, and its immaturity because it is so overtly obvious, and like anything childish, of no real lasting interest artistically.

The story is not complex. It is deliberately confusing in order to conceal its stupidity. Nothing that really matters is explained in the movie.And there's so many embarrassing clichés (the recruiting of the team, the episode in Mombassa, the assault of the ice fortress, many of the action sequences)... the average viewer must be disappointed!And the dreams - which serve as the scenario to most of the movie - are populated by the utmost lack of imagination.Finally, there's the score, louder and louder, building a suspense that is never there, for everything is a dream, and we do not quite catch what there is exactly that can go wrong...Well, all in all, the movie is an insult to the average intelligent viewer and, having been directed by Christopher Nolan, an ultimate disappointment.\\n\",\n",

The plot was overly drawn out and repetitive, and there was an over-reliance on action, with massive portions of the plot being taken up by filler scenes of silly shoot-outs and car chases.Christopher Nolan has given this film a superficial sheen of meaningfulness, with the admittedly astounding visuals covering for a plot so full of holes it\\'s almost falling apart. Why are Dom and Mal shown as having grown old and grey together in limbo when they are also shown laying their head on train lines to escape limbo as 30-somethings? Why does the incessant music come to dominate the film, making every scene feel climactic, which is actually detrimental to the final climax? In a similar manner to the way in which the Wachowski brothers took the brilliant writings of Baudrillard and completely mangled them beyond all meaning in The Matrix, Nolan has taken a great idea and turned it into a teenage boy\\'s shoot-em-up action fantasy. People might watch it and think \"Wow, that\\'s really deep\". No, it\\'s not. It has the appearance of being deep and meaningful when in fact it\\'s just a shallow action film.I\\'m sure people will read this review and think \"she just doesn\\'t get it\".

At least in the Matrix Neo could fly.The movie just contradicts all of its own rules.

Also I really like Memento...it was such a cool, original movie..so I was looking forward to this.I went to see this movie last weekend. It was an 11:00pm showing on Sunday night, 3 weeks after opening night and the theatre was packed! We had to sit in the second row...something I don\\'t mind at all.Epic Fail The movie is about corporate (not even government) spies, that enter people\\'s dreams through some unexplained technology. Once in the dream, they trick the victim into giving up his/her secrets. Pretty simple premise, and one that can be taken into many directions (after all we\\'re in dreamland). Well the direction is down the crapper.The whole premise of the movie is so shallow, Saito, a corporate CEO hires Cobb (Leo) to go into another CEO\\'s dream and plant an idea of breaking up his fathers empire (upon his father\\'s death), so that Saito can have a monopoly. How\\'s that for a story?? What a joke.Well the movie starts slow and drags on and on, besides that there are so many plot holes and explaining of everything that happens..like they manipulate the victim by having a dream, within a dream, within a dream. When you are falling in the first dream, the second layer has no gravity, but the third and forth layer has gravity?? WHAAAA??? Also even though you are in a dream, you have no super powers..you use boring guns? How about shooting lighting bolts out your you know what?? BOOORRING.To add to the boredom, Cobb\\'s wife Mal killed herself because she thought she was dreaming. And appears regularly to bore us to death, you get the sense that she\\'s supposed to be evil, but it never pans out.This was interesting on one level only...there was no antagonist. But then again there was no love interest either, and on top of that no danger, cause if you get killed in a dream, all you do is wake up.This movie is amoral tripe with no imagination..eg. you are in a dream world, instead of driving around in a VAN, why not fly? Instead of shooting guns, why not freeze them in their tracks? Also, there are many people (I assume teenagers) who are saying how original this movie is. The Dream within a Dream thing has been done before...it\\'s called \"A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3: Dream Warriors\"..also don\\'t EVER compare this tripe to the \"Matrix\". Matrix was original, it was filled with clever allegory, it was truly awe inspiring, but there was NOTHING clever about Inceptipon.The climax was okay, but just because after 2 hours I couldn\\'t wait to get out of there.Now the anti-climax, is an entirely different animal, like the viewer hasn\\'t been insulted enough...we are left to ponder weather it was \"all a dream\" (again not very original). The answer is yes, it was all a dream, and Cobb is still in a dream..his kids look exactly the same, even wearing the same clothes as his other dreams.Please do yourself a favour and do not pay to see this garbage. So far the best movie this summer has been Predators...how sad. People think this movie is clever and original because they are teenagers..it probably is clever and original to them, but any adult will find this movie dull and boring.

I laughed at the Kubrick tributes. Beyond that, the thing was too simple for words - but dressed up to be a deep and meaningful experience.

Like in \"The Matrix,\" only inside brains instead of a mainframe! Wow. Uh, sure.) but on a moral one. See, the film has NO PROTAGONIST. It has criminals, it has those who facilitate those criminals\\' activities, and it has a victim. That\\'s all.And, yes, I had-- and have-- a real (or is that \"real\"-- see, I\\'m of the camp that thinks the whole sorry mess took place in Cobb\\'s bigger mess of a head) problem with that.Almost no one (I would have opted for a plain, sweeping \"No one,\" no \"almost,\" but I recall one review among dozens and dozens that hit on what I\\'m about to say) seems to see anything wrong with the idea that Cobb and his crew are (ostensibly-- pretermitting for the time being the perpetual argument regarding whether the whole sorry scenario is or isn\\'t a dream) performing an act of mental violation on an innocent man. Why is this? The action isn\\'t that impressive (even the infamous hotel-corridor sequence)-- yes, Nolan does \"loud\" and \"in your face\" very well, but the Bond films have been doing more breathtaking and cleanly shot action work for four decades now. (I actually laughed out loud when Cobb and Arthur, decked out in pimp-fashion leather coats and stocking masks, shouted threats at kidnapped Robert Fischer in a dream-warehouse-- not, of course, to be confused with a warehouse of dreams (that might invoke imagination): what, you couldn\\'t just have your goons strong-arm a kidnappee in the \"real\" world, Nolan? This is as creative as you can get?) We can\\'t just proffer \"Cobb must see his kids again at any cost!\" as an excuse-- or can we? (I would certainly hope not.) Is it because Fischer is a Caucasian businessman, and therefore intrinsically deserving of attack in this economically volatile era? (The argument that Fischer\\'s business rival Saito is somehow bravely trying to prevent Fischer from forming a monopoly is weak at best: that\\'s what anti-monopoly laws are for, and, by agreeing to attack Fischer on Saito\\'s behalf, Cobb is merely enabling Saito to form a monopoly of his own. And, seriously, inception and/or extraction would be ridiculously iffy forms of espionage. Break into the safe inside my skull, Cobb my boy, and enjoy the five hundred verses of \"I\\'m \\'Enry the Eighth, I Am\" I\\'ve got planted there.) Or is it, possibly worst of all, because Cobb and his goons \"kindly\" leave Fischer with happy thoughts of his coldhearted father? (From monopolies to psychiatry, then: if Robert Fischer has daddy issues, that\\'s what analysts are for. Cobb and his stampeding creeps are in Fischer\\'s mind to commit a crime; any \"resolution\" they provide him is a byproduct of that crime, and resoundingly, cruelly false.)We might argue that Cobb and his crew are anti-heroes, but they\\'re not. \"The Dirty Dozen\" are anti-heroes, criminals and psychopaths nonetheless working for the forces of good by fighting an evil greater than themselves (that evil being the nasty Nazis); Dom Cobb is nothing more than a thief (and, despite the ad copy, not a very good one) perpetrating an insidious act of mental rape against an innocent man (and, by extension, all those who rely on that innocent man\\'s business for their livelihoods). Why all the sympathy for this thug and his crew? What\\'s the catch? When children are involved, or when guilt (real or imagined) is in the mix, are we just supposed to chuck morality out the window...? (The last sad thing, I guess: No one on the team, not even newbie Ariadne-- and, granted, she\\'s likely either a figment of Cobb\\'s imagination, like the story as a whole, or a plant-- questions the \"right\" of what they\\'re doing. Not only does this make me deeply uncomfortable, it\\'s incredibly shallow writing. An opportunity for character development, tossed. But that\\'s classic Nolan, isn\\'t it? If he can\\'t cover it with an iconic grunt-- \"She was lovely,\" Arthur deadpans to Ariadne, when Ariadne asks what nasty dream-shade Mal was like when she was alive (heck, Arthur, she\\'s still, technically, \"lovely\"; we were looking for maybe just a touch of explanation here regarding her relationship with Cobb and the team, big boy)-- it doesn\\'t get covered.) Or, in the end, are we just supposed to excuse the immorality of the situation by saying, \"Ha! It\\'s all a dream anyway!\"? Very much bothered by this, especially since this behemoth has gulped down some one billion dollars in box-office take worldwide....... and that\\'s why I\\'m giving it two stars. Cillian Murphy looks very nice in his natty suits, and he cries very prettily before Nolan realizes that-- horrors!-- someone is emoting on screen, and jerk-cuts away. Marion Cotillard does her best to squeeze dimensionality from yet another one-d Nolan-woman part; as Mal, she\\'s a sad, psychotic, lovely mess. One star for each of them.

People don\\'t like to be stupid and having seen that it\\'s written, produced and directed by the same guy who did The Dark Knight they don\\'t think anymore and go to see Inception.So, I will show you that Mr. Nolans movie is the opposition of \"complex and intelligent\": SUPERFICIAL. I have at least 6 arguments:1. The characters are just silhouettes, transparent and shallow. There is no psychological deepness; the protagonists are emotionless objects moved from place to place like chess figures. They don\\'t have any soul. But what marked a movie is his developing of characters. Sure, you try to create something deep with the relationship between DiCaprio and Cotillard but it\\'s just pathetic, amateurish and stereotypic. And then the kids\\' back that we see so often that it gets on the viewer\\'s nerves.2. The music by Hans Zimmer is a torture. It\\'s so loud and indifferent that your head is ringing at the end. 3.

It\\'s so stupid. Almost propaganda for war.4. Then, Nolan will make this movie \"intelligent and complex\". Do you know M. Nolan that intellectual and deep does not mean emotionless and a confusing plot? 5. Nolans idea to enter in the dream of somebody else is not so bad but the idea is not exhausted. Dreams are imagination, there are no rules, and they are bizarre and strange (Have you ever seen a film by David Lynch Mr. Nolan? That is like a dream.). So what all the guys with guns are doing there? Why are there always skyscrapers or a military base? That\\'s stupid. There is NO IMAGINATION, your dreams are copies of real life and they are even WORSE than reality. The only good thing is the sequence with the train.6. To select a well actor like Michael Caine for saying two lines is just embarrassing and disrespectful.

Then on the way to the prom you get a flat and you go and change it and you get oil all over your tux. Then you go to the prom and you think it'll be so cool now that more people are being added to the mix. But it's not, and it sucks because there's now so much sexual tension built at this time the dudes don't wanna dance for fear of boners and the girls don't want to for the same reason... Then you finally leave and get out to the hotel and you think ah well, this whole night was crap but this will redeem it. This will make it all better... Then you realize she's got braces... And her hymen's still intact... And what ensues is 20 minutes of nothing but blood, pain, and screams of agony coming from both parties till eventually you can't even look at her anymore and you wont be able to jerk it for a month now because your scabbed penis needs time to heal.... Yeah thats what inception was like to me....Stick with Momento...esk stuff dude\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : I truly cannot understand why anyone would call this a good film. Fancy special effects, yeah, plenty many lots... but special effects do not make a film. It also needs a storyline that doesn\\'t shoot in every direction, left, right, backwards and forwards throughout the entire film for lack of substance.OK, so the dude wants to plant an idea in someone\\'s brain. Got that after a minute or so of viewing. And then what? It feels too much like a storm in a teacup.Frederic Dard (french novelist) used to describe futuristic gadgets by means of expressions like \"he\\'s pointing a gloombobber with spiral condensing palchromium in my direction\" but, being a talented writer, he had the good taste of limiting such eccentric nonsense to a single sentence per book, whereas Inception is made up of nothing but that from beginning to end. Each time the dream-team runs into a potential nag, there comes a gloombobber out of a hat. Too predictable after a while. \"This can\\'t be done in a three-dimensional space... no problem, we\\'ll do it in seven!\" would be an adequate tag-line for Inception.I couldn\\'t follow the storyline and am not convinced there actually was one. It reminded me of the Brownian movement observed at the surface of a pot of boiling water. It was so confusing that switching actors every two minutes for the part of the main character would have gone unnoticed in this maelstrom of nonsensical garbage.In conclusion I don\\'t see any point in watching Inception unless you\\'re extremely high on speed or a fan of special effects who doesn\\'t give a whoopdeedo about well-constructed stories in the first place.\\n',\n",

I never do this, commenting on a movie I haven\\'t seen in its entirety, but I will make an exception in this case because it reeked of pretentious and \"interesting\" from the very start. Christopher Nolan must be so full of it by now, with the success of the Batman series, that he thinks he can discard some platitude on to the screen, by relying on big stars and some teenage fantasy...and by the way, other than Watanabe,Caine and Berenger, what\\'s with all the teenage looking actors (I have to admit, good ones)? For a second there, I thought they are turning Beverly Hills 90210 into a movie.

Drop the viewer into a complete state of confusion to look good?.....except that this is always a risky strategy, one which a only few films have eloquently pulled off, the nearest comparable being The Matrix, which this most certainly isn't- although it tries so hard to be in terms of style and delivery. Yes the CGI and special effects are at times breathtaking. It's just such a shame that the storyline was utterly ridiculous, disjointed, confusing dispassionate and so very, very boring. Great effects DO NOT make for a great film necessarily. A note on casting. Like the film, this is truly awful....what on earth was Leonardo Di Caprio thinking?!

       " \"Review of Inception : Warning: spoiler alert:After watching Inception I have this question to ask: The movie played with the idea, that we can't always tell the difference between a dream and reality. Sometimes when dreaming, we realize, that we dream and that helps us awake. Other times, we don't realize that we are dreaming and then we are stuck in the dream. The question, which everybody ask themselves is: Did Cobb awake at the end of the movie or did he kept dreaming? I would like to ask this: DOES IT MATTER? Because through the two hours, I didn't get any background of this guy. I don't know who he is, what he likes to do, where are his faults, what are his hopes for the future. I am not even sure if he has a wife- and if he does, if Mal exists, then I don't know anything about her too. Not to mention their supposedly small children. My point is: This movie didn't have any story, didn't have any heart, didn't have any life in it. All characters were just figures, with no background and no emotional structure. So what do I care about Cobb, or his wife, or his mission? Because I don't even know what his mission was- to make the Asian guy even richer? And if you think it is so wonderful, that the movie didn't gets any straight answers, let me tell you this: the movie doesn't even ask a question. It doesn't make you think, because, at the end of it- there is no story behind it. There is no moral dilemma, there is no character development. And I feel really sorry for Leonardo Dicaprio - who started as a very promising actor, but somewhere in the way decided to act important and pretend to be smart. First he made The Blood Diamond- a very good movie. Then he made 11th Hour- a very good environmental movie. And then he went vacationing with Naomi Campbell on an yacht. What better way to prove that you believe in what you preach? Don't make the mistake to believe Inception has anything to offer, but some false sense of self importance.\\n\",\n",

If enough people say something is great a lot of others are likely to be swept along by the idea, frightened to go against popular opinion. Well I'm glad that a lot of people have been honest enough to say that this film is not half as good as the marketing department would have us believe.The latest I heard from the pluggers was the film has to be seen more than once to appreciate it. Ha! Good try guys but I can't imagine anyone being prepared to give this another try.The script made no sense and the characters were unbelievable. Worst of all, I felt no attachment for any of the characters and did not care what happened to them.In my opinion, this is a meaningless, uninspired waste of time. Unoriginal idea, weak script, insipid acting, plot and logic holes galore do not add up to a blockbuster.

I am expected to believe that a group of people smart enough to construct an elaborate plot involving breaking into other people's dreams are not smart enough to reunite a man with his family without getting stopped at customs? That's stupid. Fly to Mexico and walk. Or fly the kids to you. This giant plot hole is unfathomably stupid, as is most of the dialogue in this two and a half hour nightmare. I think my personal favorite line in the movie was when DiCaprio's character told his dream wife that he could not do her justice because he could not remember all of her perfections and all of her imperfections.

That's what maybe causes a feeling of disorientation. And honestly this plot is so empty, that it feels it was written around the idea of creating special effects of this kind.I think people pretend to like this movie because all the eye candy makes it look like there should be more to the plot, and people don't want to admit that they could find anything deeper in it. So they make excuses about the complexities and great visuals and add meaning to unimportant scenes so keep the feeling alive that this is really deep stuff, because everybody else also says it's deep , so nobody wants to be the dumb guy that doesn't get it.

I managed to watch this farce for about half an hour, I desperately wanted to give it a chance, but every passing minute is such an insult to my intelligence that I cannot carry on. Then I tried again to continue, because I thought it's not fair to rate a movie without watching it to the end. But then again, I'm not a masochist.This film is the perfect example of how movie success depends hardly on movie quality, but almost solely on marketing. The same happened with the Matrix a few years back. Farcical setting, totally unrealistic story, but great marketing: Box office success.You probably already know the deal, unfortunately I was unsuspecting before I tried to watch it: Getting into other people's dreams, creating a believable world in the dream where multiple dreamers can interact with each other, and in this way, collect important information from the mark. Of course the dreams also have dreams within, and it's hard to know what is real and when your're dreaming.Whatever. No idea why anyone would WANT to watch this, other than because of the hype. But the hype has very little to do with the quality of the film.This film's whole focus is on the farcical notion of creating dreams for people, and especially, interacting with other characters in the dream who are dreaming the exact same dream. If the film were not so consumed by this outragous technicality, and it had some character and heart, some sort of purpose, I could probably let slip the ridiculousness of the whole theme. I have been known to enjoy the odd sci-fi. But it lacks any heart, all it does is try to look smart.I find it grossly unfair that this junk rates above 9 on IMDb. However, my rating of 2 is not because I want to bring the total down, it is rather what I think the realistic rating is. And that 2 is a very generous score.\\n\",\n",

And why 2 actors as prime characters who look like children? I'm referring to Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I like them both as actors but they are supposed to be a crack team of experts, hard to believe when 2 of them look about 14 years old.

       " 'Review of Inception : Christopher Nolan has done some great work.His ideas and direction singlehandedly gave new life to the beloved superhero Batman.While the film Dark Knight will always be recognized to the new dimensions it added to the classic Batman series of movies and comics, Inception was nothing more than a dull and linear plot, surrounded by and an even duller and more linear plot.The centerpiece of this movie was supposed to be its convoluted storyline which was scattered across multiple levels, in essence puzzle that forces the viewer to think through the movie and decipher the ending.The concept of \"levels\" and or \"interconnected plots\" worked very well for such great films such as the Matrix, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Logan\\'s Run, or Total Recall. Inception not only miserably fails at this but it also lacks in other places as well.-Characters: Great actors, whom have all done great work in many movies spanning decades. However the characters in this movie came off as neutered eunuchs who lacked sense, emotion, and any sort of cohesiveness. (Sir Michael Caine and Tom Berenger\\'s performances were appalling and the \"team\" of dreamers lacked screen dynamics and chemistry.) -Action: For a dream world, the action in this movie is very unimaginative and is well within the typical Hollywood bounds. Car cash scenes where the heroes drive and shoot, building shootouts, and melodramatic bullet wounds (as always one character is wounded critically, the team must save him; however the character can still \"fight\".) -Plot: This movie could have easily been over within 1 hour of rolling. Not only was Inception\\'s \"puzzle ending\" blatantly obvious 40 mins into the film, but the storyline it self lacked any substance or draw. The overly complicated \"puzzle piece\" effect which Nolan was trying to achieve, was nothing more than the main story line being surrounded by excessive fluff and whimsical bullplop.*I will credit the movie with one notable mention. Nolan managed to work a Matrix style fight scene (which have been overdone by Hollywood since the early 2000s) into the small confines of an elevator.In the ending, Inception is not the great rave that many make it out to be. While the movie takes place in a \"dream world\", where bounds are limitless, the movie itself is sterile, cliché, repetitive, and unimaginative. This is even further compounded by one dimensional characters, and a drawn out storyline that pretends to be an enigma.Perhaps Christopher Nolan\\'s true intent was to make a sterile and lack luster movie aimed strictly at making today\\'s self-absorbed and obtuse Facebook-hipster generation feel \"smart\".Inception can be compared to a class presentation where the student is unprepared. To hide this, the student uses convoluted and circular logic to stammer through the presentation and pass the time. It is obvious that the student knows nothing and has wasted several minutes talking about a subject that could have been explained in seconds. Nonetheless, since the student used \"big words\", talked excessively, and is deemed to be in the \"mainstream\" the class gives a standing ovation regardless...\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : I have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film, takes some doing.Here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film. You have great special effects, a sci-fi conundrum, beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It\\'s like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It\\'s an empty shell of a film. There is no tension; you couldn\\'t care less about any of the characters, why were they even motivated to do what they did. Helping a corporation get \"one over\" on another corporation is hardly saving the human race.When you operate in a dream environment, where you can\\'t die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about, who cares what happens. All the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless. By the way, why does Hollywood still keep filming action scene\\'s an inch away from every characters nose? It\\'s impossible to see what\\'s going on, so many films are ruined by this. Watch and learn from the Matrix, take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what\\'s going on.So 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending, is a million miles from being a good film. How anyone in their right mind can give this 10/10, it\\'s boring and pointless. A film has stir the soul, has to grab you, you need to feel for the characters. Can anyone, honestly say, they cared about anyone on show here.By the way, here\\'s an idea, why don\\'t you bring the children (who haven\\'t aged a minutes since you last saw them) to you, if you can\\'t go to the US.I know the end scene was trying to be ambiguous, but the fact his father, who lives in Paris, is bizarrely there in the US to meet him (how did he know) and the children look identical to every dream sequence they appeared in, means there wasn\\'t much doubt.In the end there is nothing at stake for anyone, so a pointless movie. I suspect Nolan will continue to get praise, but I can\\'t really say I\\'ve got excited about any of his movies. They all leave me cold.

       " \"Review of Inception : Alright, so here's the thing; yes, it was cool that there was all that complexity. Yes, it was cool that there were so many layers of thought both on screen and off to what was going on. Yes, it was cool that Chris Nolan managed to make something unique and fairly independent in just one movie that was complex enough to account for a whole trilogy of movies in almost any other genre. But here's the thing; it had some rather alarming logical leaps that I could not get over.1.The Projections; Okay, so the things that inhabit the streets of the person's subconscious are manifestations of the various components of their brain as evidenced by the fact that when the characters need to find something out about the dreamer's perception of someone else they just follow that manifestation in the dream. Makes sense, because that thought does what the dreamer thinks it would do, not what the real person would do. When I saw that I went 'wow, that makes sense! Clever!', but then towards the end of the movie they say 'nevermind, they're just projections; they don't actually mean anything, and parts of their minds aren't being killed.' That was a little too convenient for my liking.2.The Totems; WHY doesn't the top fall over in the dream world? WHY does it keep spinning perpetually? Everything else obeys the laws of basic physics, so why wouldn't that? That was probably the dumbest thing I've seen in a movie this year; there wasn't even an attempt made to explain it. I can honestly say this was just as bad as 'only a prime can kill a prime' in Trasformers 2.3. The Architect/Dreamer Relationship; Why can only the architect choose the world they enter? And why is the only person who 'projects' characters into this world the person that's 'the dreamer'? They are ALL dreaming, every single one of them, so they should ALL be both altering the world they're in and the characters in it. And why can't the projections do anything cooler than be normal guys with guns? If I detected intruders in my mind I'd summon a nuke or Godzilla or Optimus Prime to get them out, not boring henchman who probably wouldn't be able to get the job done anyways.4. The Script, and it's supposed 'surprises' I felt kind of talked down to when they honestly expected it to be a surprise when you discovered that Molly's death was as a result of Cobb's previous inception. If ANYONE made it through that movie without figuring that out they deserve to be jettisoned into the sun for their stupidity. I caught on the moment he mentioned that inception was possible.5. Waking Up/Dying in the Dream When you die in the dream world you come back up a level towards consciousness, as evidenced by the fact that they wake up when they get shot in the face in the first scene. But wait! When they die in the dream you actually go down to limbo as evidenced by that happening to the oriental guy, which sucks because that's where it's just 'pure subconscious' and you wake up a vegetable. But wait! You actually aren't in an endless limbo because Cobb and Molly went there once, but you still wake up a vegetable. But wait! You actually don't wake up a vegetable because Cobb and Molly didn't when they killed themselves on the train tracks. But limbo is still bad.......right? Because you can't get out without becoming mentally handicapped, but if you can kill yourself to get out at any time just like a normal dream then why is limbo even bad? And isn't inertia supposed to wake you up? Technically the van falling off the bridge should have woken them up, or even it rolling, not it hitting the water. If the force of hitting the water is what woke them up, then shouldn't anything like a slap to the face do it? In the end the movie suffered from the EXACT same things The Dark Knight did, and that is Chris Nolan's conflicting desires to make something believable and for sensationalism, and both cancelling out the other. If you wanted to compare it to the other obvious similar franchise,The Matrix actually is believable. Oh, yeah, now that I think of the matrix, how does a tiny needle plugged into their wrist plug them into an alternate reality in Inception? The base of the skull made sense, this is just silly. People keep saying this is the next Matrix, but the difference here is that literally twenty views later everything in the Matrix STILL makes sense, and I punched holes in this latest Leonardo Decrapio movie in one sitting. Pathetic.\\n\",\n",

I'm sure Di Caprio et al had in depth briefings about the narrative and can explain it verbatim but us viewers are left to work it out for ourselves. And it's so full of holes, so full of irrelevant tripe and so full of itself that it isn't easy. It's incredible that its been voted the 3rd best film of all time by IMDb users.

It's such a smug self congratulatory film from the get go and it just gets smugger as time drags on.Now of course I appreciate that you can go too far in explaining every detail to the viewer with unnecessary script mechanics that insult the viewers intelligence. However, although you can go too far in explaining, you can also go too far in NOT explaining and expect the viewer to grasp in a single viewing what is a massively complex concept film - and one that's so badly flawed in so many areas for it to undermine the whole 'intellectual' nature of it. The idea of the film is OK and the film does have its moments but there are so many scenes that don't make sense that it spoils it entirely. I appreciate that 'heist' movies are usually procedural and that Nolan wanted to avoid that but in doing so he's created the most self-indulgent picture ever.I could go on about the snow scene, the thoroughly implausible way these people not only do what they do but 'assemble' as a team, the oh-I'm-Christoper-so-considerably-cleverer-than-you-are-Nolan backstory with Di Caprio's wife but I'm not going to pick apart the scenes because I'd be here for hours and I haven't got the energy left after enduring this nonsense. Besides; everything could be spun that he meant this or that (he isn't as deep as he likes you to think). Inception is all fur coat and no knickers. It explains so little of what is going on that I left feeling angry. And I generally get these films so it's not a case of me being some moronic fool who struggles to follow the weather. And billed as a completely original idea? Nah. There's obvious similarities with The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Flatliners, Vanilla Sky, Pan's Labyrinth, Dream Demon and even one of the Star Trek Next Generation Episodes centred around the holodeck, all of which I've 'gotten' - the good ones, the bad ones, the ones you ponder for days afterwards. The fact is with this abomination I simply can't be bothered to think about it because I really don't care. I don't care about the characters, I don't care about the ending (which was excruciatingly predictable) and I don't care about how clever Nolan thinks he is. You're not mate. You've pulled a massive con with this film by creating a movie where you can call people stupid if they don't get it / like it. You get to sneer and snigger at the stupid little people. You've taken your previous successes to the movie execs and they've foolishly allowed themselves to fund your rampant self indulgence. That's what irritates me the most about this utter piffle. I understood what was understandable about this film and there are of course films where the intention is to purposely let the viewer fill in the gaps with their own imagination (generally a nice touch) but that simply isn't the case here. The story script and indeed most of the awful acting (outside of Di Caprio, Juno girl and Cillian Murphy) neither holds it together nor papers over the cracks of a weak script that's trying to be oh so deep... and badly failing.This is over 120 minutes of my life that I will never ever get back and I simply couldn't wait for the film to end. I had lost all interest in any of the characters, their backstorys or indeed the 'mission' after an hour once I woke up to the fact that he was clearly unable to pull the film together into something coherent and genuinely contemplative. And judging by the rest of the audience and the people I was with, I wasn't the only person who left feeling bitterly cheated. I congratulate Nolan on creating hysteria, mass hypnosis and hype because he's clearly managed to brainwash a lot of the audience into making them think they've seen a clever film. That's the only inception.Go and see this insidious fluff for a visual experience perhaps (even then; visually it's pretty overrated). But don't be surprised if you feel a strange peer group pressure to tell whoever you go to see it with that you understood it all when you probably didn't (or if you did; that you actually care and did so in spite of a dumb script).Nolan is not nor ever will be Kubrick. Kubrick would have done this film justice - after he had rewritten the script, changed half the cast, removed 45 minutes of length and replaced it with sensible content that made the film engaging and cohesive. I fear the next set of people to be duped will be those who vote for this trite idiocy come the Oscars.BTW I wager that Nolan watched Guy Ritchies Revolver and liked it. Congratulations Christopher, you have just descended to his level of filmmaking.Meh.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : I would have honestly given the movie a 7 but the current rating is very undeserving and I had no choice but to make the least contribution I could make to it. The writer/director of Inception thought if maybe they pretended to have a very complex plot and great special effects, the audience would not realize how pointless the whole story is. The audience were like; \"OH! Such a complex plot! A Genius!! A Masterpiece!!\" The first hour and a half all they do is explain the whole inception system without moving the plot forward. I am sure most of the audience didn\\'t get what the movie was about but they pretended so they would not look stupid. And Christopher Nolan is going;\"I don\\'t really think of films in terms of light and dark...blah blah blah! I am a genius! blah blah blah! ...thriller that takes place in the mind...blah blah blah! I am a genius! blah blah blah!\" The intention of the film clearly reflected on itself. The point was not to entertain audience but rather it was a show-off of what artistic capability the director/writer possesses. It tried to point out the fact what a movie genius Christopher Nolan is. I mean I love this guy. The Prestige was great and so was the Dark Knight. But Inception was really showing off. Look at Kick-Ass, Watchmen and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. They were complete honest movies. Their intentions were clean and they reflected in the movie. They were meant for pure entertainment and that\\'s what we got. On the other hand Inception was trying too hard. I could really point the fact on how the intentions of the movie was showing off but I would rather suggest the audience to watch the movie once again. They said the movie was very unpredictable. Suppose there is a man chopping onions in the movie and suddenly the chopped onions turned into a chicken. Now would that be predictable? They might say Cobb\\'s wife living with him till old age in the dream was unpredictable. Are you serious!! How come you haven\\'t seen that one coming!! It was so obvious! It is only the fact the way it was dramatized that made it seem unpredictable and shocking. Top 10 in the IMDb chart!!! Are you kidding me!!\\n',\n",

Now that's hilarious. They might have proved one thing they are saying which is planting an idea in minds.

Dumb! was that enough DUMS! for you to make you feel sure this is the greatest film of the 21st century, Christpher Nolan's multi-layered visionary masterpiece? No? Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! Come ON! Surely that must be enough DUMS! for you to realise that you're witnessing a tour de force from a director at the pinnacle of his genius? It's a film of transcendent majesty! A mind blowing spectacle utterly thrilling to the senses and deeply fulfilling to the intellect! And if you're not convinced of this, I can do what Christopher Nolan does, and just keep going Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! until you are! It's a trick that seems to have worked on most people as they wander out of the cinema like wide eyed happy zombies, eager to write their adoring review on IMDb and give praise to Christopher Nolan who has now basically attained to them the status of God, but it doesn't work on me. I don't know why, but for some reason the idea that this film is a mesmeric piece of shimmering cinematic brilliance hasn't been 'incepted' into my mind.Actually I do know why. It's because it isn't a mesmeric piece of shimmering cinematic brilliance it's two and a half hours of sheer unadulterated boredom. There's no character development. The drama is unengaging. The action sequences are bizarrely devoid of tension. It's uninvolving. The characters waffle on and I don't care what they're saying. The gunfight sequences are tedious. The enemy characters frequently fire bursts of rounds but never manage to hit anyone despite ample opportunities. How many times does Nolan think it's a great idea to show a character floating around in a hotel corridor while fighting 'projections'? And someone please tell him that he can't prove to the world he's made the best film ever by going Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! over and over again. Except apparently he can.The basic idea has the potential to make the stunning film so many people think it is, but Nolan wastes the opportunity with a dull storyline. Getting a business man to split up his company? Is that the most exciting thing he could think of? Couldn't he get a president to decide to launch a nuclear attack or something? Did it have to be something so mundane? And he weighs down the film with an abundance of under developed material and fails to create any sense of danger in the fights.Why does everyone think this film is SO good? People don't seem to be able to tell the difference between a film that tries to be fantastic but fails, and a film that is fantastic.Good things? yes it's had a lot of money spent on it. There are some striking images. Ellen Page is super pretty...erm...\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : I don\\'t get all the positive reviews for this movie. I found it overlong and I could not find a reason to care about any of the characters. Technically speaking, there was no true heroic character, as it was a bunch of technologically-advanced criminals and their victims. At several points during the movie I was pleading \"Go home! Go home!\" It had a decent idea but I have to think that Rod Serling (RIP) probably could have done a much better job with this and he would have done it in a shorter time. I really think the writers and producers could have made a tighter film with better and more interesting characters. Christopher Nolan did terrific, terrific work with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but this film is unworthy of its success.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Inception : Don't get me wrong, Christopher Nolan (writer, producer and director of this movie) is a very, very talented filmmaker. He will undoubtedly make that masterpiece for which he will be remembered. But that's just my point: he hasn't made it yet. The Dark Knight wasn't it and Inception certainly isn't it. Inception is a product of a director who has been given carte blanche. His vision has been put on film without someone ever saying: 'Chris, that's not going to work.' For that matter, Inception should have been Nolan's Heaven's Gate. But Inception will probably make Nolan a even bigger star. He better check his totem\\x85 I felt compelled to write a review when I found out this movie had a 9.2 rating and a 3rd place overall in the top 250. Let me say: that is ridiculous. To balance the scale, I have rated this movie (a ridiculous) 1. I agree with some posts on the message board of IMDb: complex does not mean intellectual or smart. And for that matter, I don't think this film is very complex. It just asks what most movies do: go with it.DiCaprio gives a pretty good performance (with leftovers from his role in Shutter Island) as Dobbs, a person who is able the penetrate someone's dream and see or steal his secrets. Recently Dobbs lost his wife and he has not seen his children in a long time. That is because the authorities think he has something to do with his wife's death. Watanabe gives Dobbs a chance to get his life back. He needs to plant an idea (inception) in the mind of a competitor. Like a seed, it will grow. And the inspiration for the idea will seem real.One of the problems for me with the movie was that the dreamworld felt pretty flat and boring to me. Unlike The Matrix (a inception for this movie), the inhabitants of the other world do not bend the rules of gravity. The laws of physics do apply. That's not a bad decision. But I agree with one reviewer: 'Nolan's dreamworld looks like a mediocre action film from the 90's.' The bad guys walk around like video game characters with an AI set on level Easy. I almost shouted in the theater when Eames went Rambo in the snow scene. I understand the decision. Look at The Cell to see how wrong you can go if you explore the subconscious on film. But still, for me his decision to keep the dreamworld neat and clean is a cop out. Dreams don't look like this. Hopes, fears and experiences mix with (the conception of) the real world and you get a pretty original result sometimes. None of this in Inception. Oh right, the architect is in control. How convenient\\x85 The whole dream within a dream concept was a little far-fetched for me. Have you ever had one? Probably not. So why, when you have a pretty basic dreamworld go with a concept this unreal? The real world does influence the dream the character's have. But they feel it and are conscious that it is the real world. That's a missed opportunity. A dream influenced by factor's unknown to the dreamer could have made it much more enjoyable for the audience.Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. Like Nolan's former projects The Prestige and The Dark Knight: I don't get all the hoopla. Yes, these movies (like Inception) are well made. They are original, have refreshing ideas, are technically good and have decent scripts. But they are not the best of the decade. And this one really is not a 9.2. I'd say a 5.5. Barely...\\n\",\n",

       " \"Review of Inception : UNDERWHELMING, LITERAL AND PRETENTIOUS.. These 3 words pretty much summed up the whole of Inception. Why populate the dream world with the same landscape and tone as the real world? Why the dreamers and their subconscious armed with real-world accessories and firearms? Why must the travel initiated with the actor's pretend sleep? Why does the levels are differentiated with only different decor? (Except the LIMBO realm) WHERE IS THE IMAGINATION? Nolan has the perfect opportunity to execute his wildest imaginations and he messed it up and served us mediocrity. Apparently, he only has the most literal interpretation of dreams. No quirky visual manifestation (mirror-world? top-down switched?), no mystical representation of the subconscious (shadows, shades, animals etc), No difference between dream levels (tones-darker?grayer?more grotesque?), No symbolic representative of weapons ( energy? aura's? light? dark? ). AND OF COURSE, the travel method!NOLAN could've presented a more sophisticated facade. Maybe a dream room with vivid machines powered with mysterious matter. Or for mobility, more visible contraptions for head, neck or body. Then, the transition can be cued with portals, or one's self entering the target's body or....to be more fantastical; the reality bleeds or tears itself into an underworld which is the dream.INSTEAD, what we've got is inferior chase and action set pieces. Save for the gimmicks of collapsing the landscape onto itself, making pathways, the movie's rather bland. It also features too many characters - the forgers, architects, point man, sedative-man, corporate-sponsor man.......you get it. IT SHOULD be anchored by one solid protagonist that's let say have a latent talent for some form of ability (dream-walker but is named with Latin words), his target and the source of his internal conflicts (family, lover, friend).This movie fools layman into thinking that they're smart.IT is basically an inferior imitation of Michael Bay's summer blockbuster disguised as a thinking man's movie. IT'S ABOUT CORPORATE ESPIONAGE - Tell people that and it would be 100% true. CERTAINLY NOT travel between dream worlds....\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Inception : I was on the verge of leaving the Cinema on this completely ridiculously story. I hung in there (also despite the insanely annoying music) though, and am simply shocked that the film has (currently) a top 3 position of movies ever made. Perhaps I have entered a (bad) dream and have not yet woken up...So the backdrop of the story is basically that a bunch of guys drug people and enter a dream world using a plastic box with wires attached to those entering the dream. In this dream they use the same technique (the box and drugs are now just apart of THIS dream..) to enter another dream. This process can be repeated a number of times - and in the movie they go to the fourth dream-layer. If you are killed while dreaming you will wake up - unless you are too heavily sedated (in real-life, or also in one of the dreams?..), which will then put you in a \"limbo\" state - which can potentially last for years. If you want to get out of a dream safely - you need to be \"kicked\" (sharp acceleration) in the dream-layer above the one you are currently in. If you are unsure if you are dreaming or not, you have a \"totem\" (a physical object that for some unspecified reason behaves differently in a dream - why?) that you can examine.I just hate it. Simply hate it...The only good thing I see in this movie is the ending: DiCaprio sees his kids again - but they look exactly as they have done in his dreams - they have not aged at all. This means that he is still dreaming and he is therefore stuck in a new limbo dream world - and will be there for a LONG time. Phew... that means there won\\'t be a sequel until he wakes up again.

       " 'Review of Inception : Inception no more explores dreams and the human mind than Star Wars explores outer space. Inception is a rip-off of the novel Fireflies in the Shadow of the Sun (FSS), published in 2004 but preceded by a web site on dreams (2001-2009), the thrust of which is about how dream experiences are the source of ideas and other changes to waking life, including personality development. The broader point is that like his character Dom Cobb, Nolan himself steals the ideas he needs to create Inception from a novelist and life long dream researcher.Chapter 7 titled \"Journey by Deflection\" occurs entirely in a shared dream in which 2 protagonists ascend / descend through \"levels of dreaming\" in action-oriented sequences and even a \"dream within a dream,\" addressing how intermittent awareness of the dreams affects the dream. But Inception does not (a) intrigue / illuminate as to how these levels are distinct and yet intrinsically related or (b) draw from real dreams and real similarities to waking life. Inception is just an action film set in dream space that neglects the essence of dreaming in dream symbolism. The dream space featured in Inception is fictitious -- a contrivance of both Nolan and of the architect in Nolan\\'s story. Inception would have benefited by emulating FSS in the one way it did not emulate it. In FSS the characters trapped in the shared dream have to solve the dream\\'s logic in order to wake up. This plot is much more conducive to an education of the language of dreams, which FSS author spent an entire lifetime understanding from the time he started a diary of his own dreams at age 13 to his doctoral dissertation at age 27 exploring the relationship between dream experiences, coping strategies, blood chemistry, and symptoms in terminally ill cancer patients. Like FSS however, and this is yet another coincidental similarity between the two works, in Inception the characters are thwarted by a dream that is plugged into their mental efforts to understand it. Also as in FSS, the dreamers have to deal with the denizens of a dream world that react to periodic episodes of lucid awareness of the dream. In FSS, the whole script, including objects and aspects of the environment, respond to the awareness, but in Inception we get the juvenile and scientifically ignorant development that other characters in the dream respond to Dom Cobb and his team like white blood cells to foreign pathogens. The bottom line is that FSS teaches us things about dreams and Inception will impress only the most psychologically unsophisticated among us or those who have never remembered a dream in their life.Also like FSS, Inception makes the point that much of the bizarreness of dreams is attributable to a higher-order thinking. It does this using a statement very similar to one from the former FSS web site, which maintained that while dreaming is a whole brain activity, the conscious person uses only about 3-5% of his or her brain. FSS author remarks that experiencing and trying to make sense of a dream is like trying to fit 100% of something into 3-5% of itself -- there will be distortion!The subject matter notwithstanding, Nolan\\'s storytelling and direction are designed to give artificial weight to the real value of plot twists. In Nolan we have a director who conceals and compensates for second-rate thinking with CGI and high-octane action that detracts from the story without getting the blood flowing. The action in the film was supposed to create a sense of time-sensitive suspense, but came across more like the dull dishwater backing up in my sink than a raging river.There are also inconsistencies in the film. Nolan wants us to invest in the idea that everything that happens in a dream has an effect on the waking life of the dreamer. It works -- until Dom Cobb dismisses out of hand his shooting of all these dream characters like they were throngs of disposable orcs or storm troopers, claiming its OK because they are \"merely projections of the subconscious.\" Suddenly, what happens in dream Vegas stays in dream Vegas. And where did the idea of \"limbo\" come from -- introduced as a patchwork device for a poorly articulated plot.And much of the film\\'s premise is contradicted by real research which shows that the relationship between perceived and actual dream time is roughly 1:1.\\n',\n",

I don\\'t know who planted this idea in their brain that this is directorial tour-de-force by Nolan but one thing is for sure, Ledger saved Nolan\\'s glutes bigtime. His screen writing technique is feeble; creativity doesn\\'t merely consist of just going berserk with visual treat and showing whatever comes in a ten second unchecked, brainstorming session rather creativity requires constraint. And this movie lacked any constraint whatsoever.If it wasn\\'t for the ultracool visual effects and graphics this movie would be nothing but a vacuous thought bubbles of a person. Whereas Nolan\\'s Dark Knight, instilled by Ledger\\'s genius, was entirely character driven, this movie was entirely fueled by graphical eye-candies. A movie resonates over time when you want to watch certain scenes from it over and over and over again in youtube or your blu-ray disc rented from your local Chinese 99c video store. There were no witty dialogs or any memorable scene in the film that will compel me to stay transfixed in the screen and rewind it over and over and over again.Movies like Vanilla Sky had the same concept yet was made more artfully where the director didn\\'t go overboard with visual scenes while having barely substantial plot.People need to seriously have a reality check. But if majority of the viewers are giving positive reviews, and if you are the only one going against the crowd that surely means there is something \"wrong\" in your system? Tsk, tsk, tsk what naysayers won\\'t realize is that it would be more comforting to delude oneself and jump on the bandwagon saying it was great film, than admit that they got \"jipped\" $10.00 for some Sony Vegas type of wizardry.

The movie unmasks itself as a very uninspired convoluted pseudo something when the protagonists have to find an alternative dream-tactic because their target protects himself. What they consider to be a new psychological trick is so plain and unoriginal that becomes clear with a \\'kick\\' that Nolan was absolutely unaware of any scientific profound background by developing the plot. The plot within a plot within a plot is not automatically an \"intellectual\" challenging procedure when one plot is the exact mirror of the other. The challenge for me was to stay awake whilst the plot stumbles from one hole to the next:How do they get connected so that can dream the same dream? Chemically, physically?? How can they transport their conscious plans into their unconscious dreams and execute them there? Etc., Etc.I can\\'t help it, but Nolan is one of the few directors in Hollywood who can direct any script as tedious as you can imagine. There are so many moments in that movie where i thought Wow, that could have been much more suspenseful if, for instance, Cameron or so had directed it.This movie is stupid. You can make a stupid plot \\'intelligent\\' by nesting it multiple times, it just multiplies its stupidity. In this sense the next Nolan movie could be a even greater \"masterpiece\" for meat heads: when it has a dump base plot every fool can follow, but this time the plot is the plot in the plot in the plot in the plot in the.....that\\'s challenging isn\\'t it?\\n',\n",

Each and every character is one-dimensional and shallow, the political setting is such a cliché and ending is easily predictable. There is a lot of stupid and unneeded chasing and shooting, punching and kicking, very much like in cheap Chinese movies. Which is fine in itself if all that you expect is an action movie, but if you expect something more memorable, then just skip it in theatres and rent a DVD in a few months. While watching such movies there is feeling that it's made like a puzzle from predefined pieces. Each piece was seen million of times before and the whole does not add anything on its own. I wholeheartedly agree that shooting a movie is not easy, and nobody can probably generate enough fresh ideas to produce a masterpiece each time.

       " \"Review of Inception : Ten years he did about this story, Christopher Nolan. I hardly understand what is so difficult to understand about this would be intellectual piece of rubbish about a dream within a dream within a dream. This is just what Night M Shyamalan has done in all of his movies. Boring us to death with a boring story for about 9/10th of the movie and then to give us an 'amazing ending', the ending here being that in fact it is not a three layered dream but about a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream so 4 layers, at least that's what my impression is as the spinning thing at the end is the talisman of either the wife or Leonard di Caprio.From the trailer this seemed to be a brilliant movie but I should have been warned by my colleagues from work, one leaving the theater before the ending and all of the others not understanding what the fuss was all about and right they are.Before this year I never believed that Leonardo di Caprio was able to play adult characters (if any at all) after watching Titanic years ago. Now I'm dead sure of it after watching Shutter island and Inception this year.Characters without character so you don't give a damn about them; endless ridiculously action scenes certainly towards the end working to an action climax that is incredibly foreseeable (dream layers ending at the same time); heavy pseudo sophisticated acting that gets on your nerves quickly. In one sentence: the biggest scam since The matrix though the Wachowski brothers are even bigger crooks as they scammed the world three times. What idiots us the public are, are we not? I have no problem with 'amazing ending' movies at least if they would make the effort to give you a story leading up to it. Here there is none.I agree there are really serious bad things to get offended about in the world, but when we feel offended in real life about being conned with situations or a product, we should be too when we are scammed in the movie theater.The 1 point I give for this movie is for the 'street bending' special effect (the other effects being rather tedious and pure special effects for the effect).\\n\",\n",

Nolan seems to have become so caught up with his own brilliance of questioning reality and dreams he's forgotten to come up with anything resembling a plausible plot. Inception is drivel. It pretends it has hidden depths and meaning by using the most convoluted plot I've seen in a film for years. It's banal, intellectually dull, and unimaginative, with not one character worth caring about. Half way through writing the plot Nolan mus have suddenly realised that if it's a dream then no-one is actually in any real danger – hence he comes up with limbo! It's like you can see him scratching his head as he realises no threat = no tension. Thus we have LIMBO!At least when Christopher Smith made the much better film - Triangle - he realised (and openly admitted) that these kind of plots are likely to get out of control BUT he also realised you can still allow people to enjoy the ride if you care about the characters and there is tension and something at stake. But with Inception there is no tension, excitement, there is no-one to care about. For Nolan's sake I hope one of his films bombs soon because that's the only thing that's going to wake him up.

Cobb succeeds, and thereby recovers his own life. No one in the film questions the morality of this; the film doesn't really question the morality of this, or invite the viewer to do so. Apparently, it's just business. Although in a way that is often thin, banal, or hypocritical, usually the sentiments offered to us in movies managed to stay aligned with basic ideas of good and evil.

Colin McGinn covers this in great depth in his book \"The Power of Movies\", in which he discusses the spatio-temporal discontinuity in films: the camera can record a given scene and then leap to another place and time entirely. This is what movies do! Nolan treats this heavy-handed hopping about as if he\\'s discovered something. What he\\'s lost is the mysterious, moody, enigmatic quality of dreams, the tremendous emotional wallop. \"Inception\" is so detailed, so measured, with constant explication, that nothing is left to the imagination. How ironic is that? And to fill a movie about dreams with carefully designed car chases, gun battles, and mayhem of all kind...it\\'s anti-dreaming. I\\'ve never watched a film so awake, so aware of itself, so full of itself. A hundred years from now when cultural historians look at this era of Runaway Bigism - Big Government, Big Corporations, Big Bodies! - they can use over-blown and spiritually empty films like this (and \"Dark Knight\") as good examples of what ruined the country.

       " \"Review of Inception : For me, this has to be one of the greatest films ever made. Christopher Nolan is a master storyteller who really outdoes himself with Inception. A story so complex that you have to watch it several times before you can really get your head around whats happened. Rarely I come across a film that is amazing in every single way. From the superb acting from the likes of Leo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and a memorable break out role for the one and only Tom Hardy. The script allows us to clearly see the personality of each character; allowing us at the same time to create our own opinion on them.All in all a masterpiece that was robbed of so many of the main awards at the Oscars that year. Some say Inception is overrated, they clearly haven't seen it enough times.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Review of Inception : Christopher Nolan, who I believe embodies the neo-noir genre beautifully, departs from his characteristic style in this one-of-a-kind epic. This surreal narrative is incredibly involving, inviting the audience in without them even realizing the complexity of the plot. Nonetheless, after it seems that the film\\'s different \"layers\" pile upon each other, they are perfectly brought to a poignant close, for Cobb and Fischer especially. The audience can only emerge from the cinema questioning reality itself.As far as the acting goes, DiCaprio performs his best role as Cobb, who essentially is in an emotional close-up throughout the film. Overall, the cast could not be better - and they all deserve recognition, but DiCaprio stands out as extraordinarily admirable.The Productions Team deserves the most applause for this production, for so many of the films fantastic effects that bring the subconscious and surreal into existence on screen, and before the camera. I was most impressed to learn that very little of the featured special effects in the film, such as the flooding castle or the exploding café, were generated by computers. Even down to the Free-Fall Hotel and rotating corridor, all of it was constructed, which gives the film a creepily realistic appearance, while creating the impossible - which is what Inception is all about.This, in my opinion, is Nolan\\'s greatest work, in complexity, scale, and overall satisfaction. He cuts no corners, and the whole is many times greater than the sum of its parts could possibly be. Inception will always rank as one of my favorite films.\\n',\n",

It stands out in the monotypic genus of honey badgers, the only one in the subfamily Mellivorinae. Known for ferocity and fearlessness at a very small size.Honey badgers are considered very fearless and even aggressive animals that have almost no natural enemies. Their very thick skin (with the exception of a thin layer on the abdomen) in some cases cannot be pierced even by the teeth of predatory large cat and poisonous snakes. Strong forepaws with long claws and teeth of honey badgers are effective defensive weapons. In addition, they are able, like skunks, to emit a stench if they are attacked. They themselves, if they feel threatened, attack animals whose size is much larger than their own, including cows and buffaloes.

       " 'Review of Inception : In Inception, Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Memento), who directs and writes the film, asks the question, \"Are we living in a dream world or is it real? And which is more desirable?\" The viewer can answer for himself as Inception plunges him into both worlds. The arena of Inception, a system containing the wild creations of its dreamers, grows more vivid, thrilling and tangible as the movie unfolds.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb, an expert extracter, someone who is able to enter the dream state of another in order to steal confidential information from their subconscious. He works mainly corporate espionage, until one of his targets, Saito (Ken Watanbe) hires him to do an inception. Instead of stealing another\\'s ideas, he is to implant one.Cobb knows the power of ideas. In one of the opening scenes, he states that ideas are the most powerful invaders of humankind, impossible to forget and capable of growing. DiCaprio is utterly convincing as the master dreamer and leader, the one who has the power to guide the others through the maze of their dream states and get out safely. This is not an easy sell because Nolan is asking us to suspend our belief about how we comprehend reality.The dangers of inception are clear. There isn\\'t just one level. To implant the idea, his team must go 3 levels down, to a dream within a dream within a dream, comprehending and dodging the obstacles of their target, Fischer, played by Cillian Murphy.Nolan visualizes this world powerfully. It becomes increasingly harder to distinguish the dream world from the waking world. People are in danger. Revolutionaries, security forces and armies hunt them down. Ellen Page as the architect, Ariadne, conjures up an entire cathedral-like structure on top of existing buildings through which she and Cobb roam freely, breaking the laws of physics. It\\'s like an M.C. Escher drawing.Our willing suspension of belief is referred back to during the climactic scenes, where the team tries to guide Fisher through the deepest level of dream state so he can discover the implanted idea himself. Nolan cuts between Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur, Cobb\\'s right hand man and a sober, level headed influence, as he battles Fischer\\'s security forces in zero gravity while the rest of the team squares off on snow-capped mountains dodging an avalanche while battling gun-toting adversaries. In \"real time\" the dreamers are packed in a van plunging off a bridge into slow motion.Cobb is tormented by a secret sorrow. He cannot prevent his wife from entering his dream states and destroying his plans. Ariadne acts as the outsider, the one who questions Cobb\\'s obsession and tries to protect him and the group against it.The cast is uniformly excellent, with Tom Hardy playing Eames, the wise-cracking master of disguise and Dileep Rao as Yusuf, the chemist charged with jolting the team from their self-induced comas and driving the van plunging off the bridge. But Christopher Nolan is the master, creating enrapturing scenes that make you pause as you try to answer the question I posed at the start of this review.\\n',\n",

       " \"Review of Inception : Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equaled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the center of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Review of Batman Begins : To tell the truth, I thought the Batman franchise could never be saved, and I was really let down that I may never see my favorite superhero in a good movie ever again. Then I saw the preview to Batman Begins, I didn\\'t really know what to think. New Batman. New Alfred. New story. New style. I wasn\\'t sure why I wanted it \\'the old way\\', but maybe I wanted to the actors in the Batman films I grew up with, to revive themselves and make a good Batman movie. I wanted Robin and sadly, Batgirl, alongside Batman saving the world from another familiar villain.I heard Batman Begins, and I thought great, this was called \"Batman\" in 1989, selfishly I said, \"I want something new!\".But, of course being a big Batman fan, I went opening night to Begings. 2 and half hours later, like the rest of the audience was completely blown away. It was the only movie I had ever been to (and yes I have been to some great ones) where the crowd claps and the end. This was not just golf claps for a popcorn clip, this was a standing ovation for 10:30 pm show in a crowded theater in Austin, Texas.I never would have thought this would have worked, even with Nolan directing. But I was wrong, so wrong. After seeing the X-Mens and Spidermans, I clearly thought Marvel had the upperhand and DC was just simply trying to keep up, again, so wrong.Nolan gave us a dark, gritty, and pleasantly realistic, view of Batman. Bale gives a tremendous performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine was a fabulous Alfred, and Morgan Freeman almost stole the show as Luscious Fox.Even though X-Men and Spiderman(all of them) are wonderful superhero movies, Batman Begins, is just a good, no, great movie. And I think that is what blew people away, that it wasn\\'t just some superhero, special effect, hero gets girl, good guy wins movie, it was a truly dark and well crafted movie, and it maybe stupid to say, but it didn\\'t even feel like you were watching a superhero movie.I don\\'t even think Burton, and his animated style(which works), could have revived this troubled series, that Schumaker wrecked, because like Fantastic Four and Daredevil, tried over do it and give us the latter part of things.So, here is to you Chris Nolan. You saved a franchise. You made an unforgettable movie, that will be remembered as the best superhero movie of all time, but just an all around great and unforgettable movie classic.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. Enter Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind 2000's 'Momento', widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As director/co- screenwriter, Nolan creates a richly dark, atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit, similar to that of the Burton films, but less cartoony. The film's screenplay, written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff, it's true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson's character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. Nolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne's backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there's little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.Of course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne's skin, it doesn't hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne's public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.And the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It's very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It's not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne's mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne's arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It's wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his 'fear gas' are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra's Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob. Nolan's knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it's environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don't think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan's realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There's even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What's not to love here?(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)Overall, I'd have to label Batman Begins 'The must see movie of the summer' - it's a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale's powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy's sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it's own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.-10/10\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : Christopher Nolan (and cast) have pulled off what I hadn't dared to dream - a Batman every bit as good as Burton/Keaton's vision - and eradicated the camp, feverish memories of Clooney, Kilmer and (cough..) O'Donnell.The story is as good an origin story as you'll find - covering all the major (true-to-the-comic) events, and not wasting ages on them. We see Wayne's all-important training period (previously ignored), and his connection to the Tibetan shadow-ninja clan led by Ra's Al Ghul. We see Bruce come up with ideas for his symbol, his costume, his gadgets, his car, his cave - IT ALL FITS SO PERFECTLY.That's not all - Liam Neeson is perfect (as ever, when Lucas isn't writing his lines), Batman's first mad nemesis (the Scarecrow) is genuinely frightening; with some outstandingly scary 'fear' effects.. Gary Oldman looks just like a young Commissioner Gordon (and doesn't dominate), Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer give solid heavyweight support to the boardroom machinations at Wayne Enterprizes. I love Michael Gough(?) but Michael Caine is great as Alfred. It's only Katie Holmes who didn't ring true for me - not because of her performance, but simply because she looks all of 15 years old (sorry Katie). I am always blown away by Christian Bale, and this is no exception.The fights are great, the Bat-gadgets all there, the car is amazing, the plot is thorough and exciting, Gotham looks great, Batman really is frightening & menacing (and lethal!).. And the scenes with the bats themselves FINALLY get across the idea of how scary they can be.There is some humour, but it's fairly dry. The soundtrack, like all the best original soundtracks, is excellent - you hardly know it's there, but the emotions of the scene are enhanced and boosted. For the most part this is a serious Batman film, with plenty for long-time fans. This NEW Batman is one I'd like to see again. Bravo Mr Nolan, bravo.\\n\",\n",

The franchise went so wrong under Joel Schumacher that I wasn't sure I wanted it resurrected. Not least because Batman was one of the few comics I read and enjoyed as a kid and was always my favourite superhero. I grew up reading the comics, watching reruns of the Adam West TV show and then getting Burton's celluloid vision. I was spoilt for choice as a kid but as an adult now I was concerned revisiting the franchise, especially given Warner's record over the last decade of screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over the place (dare I bring up the Matrix sequels?)However, I am pleased to report I could not have been more wrong about how great Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is. This is better than Burton. Sacrilege, you say?! Well Burton was still cartoony in many elements, he wasn't churning out the bilge of Schumacher but Burton's Batman was still over the top. As a kid this was ideal but Nolan's Batman is real. Everything in this world seems plausible and it is therefore a world that draws you in. Characters' vulnerability is that much more present. Every bruise, every scare, every concern, every emotion seems real.Part of this is that Nolan has assembled an exemplary cast. Again, this concerned me prior to seeing the film. I wasn't sure a cast of big name legends like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman and well known names like Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes wouldn't detract and distract from Batman. I was always sure Christian Bale could be the great moody Batman he's been waiting his career to be but the others I wasn't so sure about.That said Bale is not just good, he's superb. I never thought I'd really be able to envision anyone other than Michael Keaton as the definitive Batman for me but since seeing Batman Begins a couple of days ago Bale has cemented himself in the position. Perhaps Keaton will now be able to escape the spectre of Batman he hasn't truly shaken off for 13 years.The rest of the cast is also pitch perfect. Cillian Murphy is creepy as hell, Liam Neeson is authoritative and imposing, Katie Holmes is strong and sexy (I particularly thought she'd be insipid, she should jettison Tom Cruise and let her talent - which she does have naysayers just watch Pieces Of April - speak for itself) and Michael Caine is an Alfred you've never seen but in fact far more likely as a butler than the aristocratic pomp with which he is usually portrayed. Gary Oldman is also superb in a rare wholly decent character for him as Lieutenant Jim Gordon who gets far more to so here than Gordon has ever had to do before. Only Tom Wilkinson is a little off with a slightly comedic wise-guy American accent that never really convinces.The emotional bond between Bruce Wayne and Alfred is actually a wonderful human heart to the film than Nolan and Goyer have written perfectly.Don't let that make you think the action is not front and centre though. From Wayne's training through the early stages of the film to his early missions as Batman at about the half way point to a thrillingly choreographed chase sequence and an edge of your seat finale this film delivers the cool quotient in bucket loads.Great villains (especially Murphy), great story, great cast, great action... put simply, great film. Probably the best comic-book movie ever made (that's excluding the genius Sin City which I consider a moving comic-book rather than a comic-book movie, that will never be bettered but Batman is a different beast and the best of its kind).\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : A young Bruce Wayne watches in horror, as his parents are killed in front of him, later in life, he vows to remove the criminal element from Gotham City.A word on Christopher Nolan first, I am a huge fan, I think of Inception, Dunkirk and Interstellar, but his magical trio of Batman movies began here, a movie that put the franchise back on top.I'm not always sold on origins movies, there have been several misfires, this is one of, if not the best, it feels very organic, at no point does it try too hard, or overdo it, the balance between story, introduction, action and character, pretty much perfect.The Cinematography is incredible almost twenty years on, the choreography, fight scenes look terrific, made at a time where the purpose of the music was to assist the film and not to drown it out, it is also excellent.Christian Bale was perfect casting, one of the best actors in the business, he is first rate, the balance between Bruce Wayne and Batman is spot on, what a skilled actor he is.An incredible supporting cast, Cillian Murphy is equally as good as Bale, putting in a fiendishly creepy and sinister performance as Crane, Freeman, Caine, Neeson, Oldman, I don't think it could have gotten any better than this.Fantastic, 10/10.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : I got a chance to see \\'Batman Begins\\' just this past Friday evening. I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the \\'Batman\\' film we\\'ve been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, \"This is it! This is the movie!\" I just can\\'t believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan\\'s decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that\\'s so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the film\\'s star. And rightly so. It\\'s amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grown-up. Her performance isn\\'t bad per SE, it\\'s just that you really don\\'t buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn\\'t tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I\\'m definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : This film easily trumps any live-action incarnation we\\'ve scene of the Dark Knight before, borrowing heavily from both the comics and the Dini and Co. animated series. This is a hard, fast, driving, heartfelt epic that draws you into the character of Bruce Wayne and makes you damn well care. Batman doesn\\'t play second-fiddle to the villains here like in the other films. It\\'s his movie and that\\'s the way it should be.Much has been said of the film\\'s \"reality\" quotient, and I\\'m here to say it works. Nolan talks about how Batman\\'s strong because he does push-ups, he gets around because of his gadgets, and by introducing each of them with a plausible explanation, we forget to quibble and go along with it. The technology may be fantastic, but it\\'s believable. And, unlike the \"reality\" of something like Daredevil, Nolan doesn\\'t forget his ideals halfway though and start having Batman wire-jump thirty feet into the air.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : I just came back from a special screening of Batman Begins and I must say this is the best movie I have yet seen this year. All of the blockbuster movies I had seen this year with much expectation have been disappointing. But Batman Begins is not the typical corny action film; it incorporates all aspects of genre: action, fantasy, drama, and even comedy. I was at the edge of my seat from the thrills in some scenes and clapping & laughing from the humorous lines that director Christopher Nolan had written for the characters. I was really amazed by the acting performances from the new generation of actors, assuming that they wouldn\\'t have been able to compete with and compliment the talented, veteran actors such as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson. I mean you couldn\\'t have asked for better actors!! Christian Bale was just perfect for the role: he had the intensity, physique, and charm you\\'d expect a Batman character to encompass. Every actor was casted perfectly for their roles. I even give props to Katie Holmes for playing a district attorney considering her previous roles consisted of \"the young girl\" or \"girlfriend\". I hardly ever see action films nowadays because I don\\'t want to waste my time watching a conventional, corny, over-digitalized,plot less film. To be honest, I gave this film a chance not because it was a Batman movie, but rather because of the talented veteran actors as well as being a fan of Christopher Nolan\\'s previous films. Whether you\\'re a fan of Christopher Nolan or just a Batman fanatic, you\\'ll enjoy every single second of the movie. People of ALL ages will appreciate this film. The violence in this movie is not vulgar, but rather sends out a lot of great messages of loyalty, respect, and humility. Not only is \"Batman Begins\" the best of the Batman series, it is the most unconventional. This recommendation is coming from a person who mostly watches art-house/independent films.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : BATMAN BEGINS lives up to what I heard about it being a \"darker\" version, with much less reliance on flippant one-liners or gags, the result being a more realistic feel for what might have been.From the very start, there is a nice chemistry between Alfred, the butler (superbly played by Michael Caine) and Bruce Wayne (excellent job by Christian Bale). The humor is of the gentle kind, almost subtle in its implications, and it sets the stage for the more realistic flow of events to follow. There\\'s a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard that races along with the film, punctuating it in just the right places, at just the right moments, to give a vigorous punch to the action scenes. And there are plenty of them.But the quieter moments are all extremely well played and given depth by real characterizations--not just cartoonish figures. There is depth in all of the performances with the possible exception of Katie Holmes, an actress who speaks in a voice barely above a whisper and fails to project the belief that she is an assistant district attorney. Miss Holmes needs lessons in projecting her voice.Looming over the landscape is Liam Neeson, a distinguished actor who excels in his carefully concealed villainy. He is a force to be reckoned with and displays all of his versatility here. Equally effective in lesser roles are Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer as the Board Chairman that Bruce Wayne ultimately replaces, and Gary Oldman.The story is forcefully presented with magnificent visuals and eye-popping sets that all have a realistic gleam and are yet stylized enough to give credence to the fact that this is all based on a comic strip character.I can\\'t praise Christian Bale enough as the man who dons that mask. He has all the strength and wily intelligence behind his serious good looks and makes the perfect embodiment of the action hero he is portraying. Firm of jaw, direct of gaze, he makes an excellent hero.Praise too for Cillian Murphy, who makes the most of his Scarecrow role behind a mask of creepy blandness, underplaying his role (as most of the others do) so as not to become a caricature, as so often happens in these Batman enterprises. If it\\'s a series of running gags that you expect--as from previous Batmans--you won\\'t find them here. The thrills come one after another, set pieces that are astounding to watch.Well worth the wait. Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job of handling his subject matter with great skill and flourish. Warning note: Perhaps a little too intense for children, but adults are certainly going to appreciate the fact that the real Batman has arrived.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : I thought this movie was absolutely spectacular, I took me by surprise. I never thought I would see a Batman movie with depth and that showed the true fear that is the character Batman that he brings to his enemies. Christian Bale did a excellent job and I truly look forward to him in another Batman Movie! The story was absolutely amazing and in my humble opinion very original. Raj Al Ghul is an excellent villain and to portray him in the way he was portrayed was top notch, not to mention he was played very well. Many people I talked to complained that the actor who played him was not of Asian decent. However I believe it truly didn't matter at all.Not to mention Alfred was great. Gordon (later Commissioner Gordon) was excellent as well.No other Batman Movie has portrayed Batman truly as the Dark Knight and as I said already I truly look forward to more along these lines.-ND\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : Eight years after the infamous abomination Batman & Robin that killed the Batman franchise, Christopher Nolan stepped in and started a whole new series a darker (even darker than the first two Tim Burton Batman movies) and realistic level. Now at first, I wasn't mad on Batman Begins because at first I thought it was boring and it took a while to get to the part where Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. But after a while, I loved the film. In fact, it turned out to be my favourite Batman movie even though I really like the first two Batman movies by Tim Burton. I really like how we get to see the origins of Batman like the tragic death of his parents and becoming a martial arts expert in somewhere in Asia. Also I think it's clever how they made Batman act like a ninja than a superhero. Christian Bale is really good and intimidating as Batman but I think he's not as good as Michael Keaton's Batman. But also I think the rest of the cast did very well like Katie Holmes, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy. But I can't understand why Katie Holmes was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress. I liked her as Rachel and she was a lot better than Maggie Gyllenhaal; not to mention better-looking. It's too bad The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises weren't as great as Batman Begins. I mean I think The Dark Knight is really overrated. I mean most people seem to be overglorifying it just because of Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker and his death. But The Dark Knight Rises was brilliant and gave a nice ending to the trilogy but I don't think it wasn't as fresh as Batman Begins. By the way, happy birthday to the creator of Batman, the late Bob Kane!\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : All i can say is thank you Chris Nolan,,,I still think you will have to be a magician to beat Tim Burton's Batman film's but Nolan has is well on his way to becoming Houdini. This is a film that describe's Batman as he was in the comics and i think as Bob Kane imagined...So how has Nolan done it..Simple..i've seen the xtras on the Region 2 DVD and it appears that he didn't rush anything and really worked hard on this and recruited the best of the best in the movie making business,it's an extremely hard character to portray and a risky franchise as a director to do a good job as Joel Schumacher found out. He has had some good films like The Lost Boys etc but his take on the Batman was purely a joke and i think he had potentially ruined a huge money making franchise...But however it has been saved with Nolan's amazing take on Gotham and Christian Bale's Dark Knight which truly is an amazing likeness to the comics,,,This film has everything that we wanted and more because it has a beginning a middle and an amazing end which makes batfan's itching for more and a sequel which promises just that,,,it has an all star cast too,Morgan Freeman and doing an amazing job in succeeding the great Michael Gough's Alfred we have Michael Caine..The villain is the Scarecrow but in true Gotham Style there are more corrupt going's on in Gotham than good and who are they gonna call to clean it up..Simple.....THE BATMAN...This film has more gadget's and lifelike special effects than any other Batman Film so it's definitely one to watch..Thanks and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did..\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : For those of you who were disappointed with the last few Batman movies, 'Batman Begins' redeems the caped crusader in a big way. 'Batman Begins' takes us on a journey through Bruce Wayne's tragic past again, giving us a real insight into what drives and fuels his quest against suffering and injustice. We discover how the billionaire came to be trained in the martial arts, develop his alter ego, and acquire his technological arsenal. Christian Bale gives us a riveting performance as not only a very dark hero, but also a tortured soul looking for the means to combat the wrongs of society, a society that we see is also responsible for the death of his beloved parents. Another thing we notice from the beginning is this story does not tie into that of the other movies in the series. This is however not a disappointing feature, in fact it seems to breathe new life into this timeless classic. So for all of us who have followed the Dark Knight's journey's, strap yourself in for a wild and inspiring ride.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : Saw a free screening on Tuesday. I must say, I had my expectations low for this one, as the previous Batman franchises was just cartoony, over the top, and flat out mind dumbing. Why do studios continually think that spending money on \\'bankable stars\\' and special effects will make a ton of money on box office receipts? Granted \"Batman Begins\" has a pretty sizable budget, but they made the right decision with casting actors that can act and hiring a director that shares the same vision of the comic book. You will not see any caricatures of the comic book, but rather be immersed in how Bruce Wayne has that internal conflict of morality as he becomes Batman. Christopher Nolan takes his time developing Bruce Wayne\\'s character in the image that Bob Kane had with his own flair to it. Anyone familiar with Nolan, Christian Bale, and Cillian Murphy\\'s work will not be disappointed with this movie. Make no mistake about it, it is a dark movie, which is what makes it so great. Nolan uses CG effects very sparingly (thank God!).I rarely give movies a 10 out of 10, as I am pretty brutal with ratings, but Nolan resurrects a failed franchise. Personally, this is what Batman should have been all along - The Dark Knight! Anyone who is a Batman, Nolan, Bale, Murphy fan will not be disappointed. I only wish I took that money I spent on \"Star Wars: ... Sith\" went to \"Batman\".\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : This is the Batman I have been waiting for! Tim Burton's Batman (Batman, Batman Returns) movies were good Tim Burton movies, but not great Batman movies. Joel Schumucher's (Batman Forever, Batman and Robin) I'm convinced were made to mock the Dark knight and destroy his good name. But this new one is everything Batman should be and needs to be. And the villains are all played to perfection! Christopher Nolan is my favorite director and this (along with Memento) is his best work. If you see no other movie this year, see Batman Begins.Note: This is not a prequel to Tim Burton's Batman. This is a completely new Batman movie series.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : I can only say what several critics have said before me; at last they capture the essence of the Batman legend on film! What makes this movie so great is how it takes its material so seriously. There is also a main theme that ties the movie together: Fear. It's relentless in its quest to explain why and how a man of Bruce Wayne's wealth and public persona would dress up like a bat and battle crime. This is the core of the movie, and it treats this with confidence and conviction. When a movie believes this much in the story it's telling, it's much easier for the audiences to believe in it as well. This is a big cinematic experience, and it shouldn't be missed. One of the year's best films, and quite possibly the best comic book-hero-movie of all time. If you have seen this movie once, then it gets even better by the second time you see it. And if you haven't seen it yet... well, what the hell took you so long?!\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : This latest Batman film disappointed a lot of people....but not me. I appreciated it because they didn\\'t overdo the violence, didn\\'\\'t have a stupid romance angle to muddy up the real story, and fount it an interesting history of how Batman became Batman. The first hour of this \"prequel\" dealt with his origins. If you\\'re a fan of the comic book stories and the other Batman films, this part in the film should not bore you. It was like a documentary to me, about a topic I was interested in. In fact, on the second viewing I enjoyed this even more.Christian Bale did a fine job as the latest Batman. It\\'s too bad there have been so many actors playing this role, ruining the continuity of this latest series. I hope Bale continues with a few more efforts with this character.It was nice to see Michael Caine in the role of \"Alfred.\" He was excellent and the stabilizing force of the story. Katie Holmes did not have anywhere near as big a role, or romantic one, as I expected, and that was fine with me. I just enjoyed looking at her face, leaving it go at that. Gary Oldman was also interesting as a low-key young detective Gordon who would go on to become Commissioner Gordon in all the other episodes (but, once again, played by another actor.)The film ends with what would be the beginning of the first Batman, featuring \"The Joker.\"After having seen all the Batman films several times, I now think is the best of them all....perhaps an unpopular choice, but that\\'s my opinion. Don\\'t let the naysayers keep you from watching this movie. You might be missing the best of the Batmans!\\n',\n",

       " 'Review of Batman Begins : yup, this film made me cry. it really did. being a hardcore batman fan, i assume i know every little secret, history, background about the dark knight. i\\'ve waited 13 grueling years (discounting batman forever and batman & robin for reasons far too obvious) to see a decent BATMAN film. Not only is Batman Begins decent, it has got to be one of THE BEST FILM EVER! i watched the film on its last screening together with my friends in Alabang. after the movie, the entire theater was deserted and i just sat there, still trying to catch my breath. It is that damn good.Christian Bale plays the perfect Batman/Bruce Wayne. Charming, handsome, and \"rich,\" as Wayne. Terrifying, maniacal, sadistic, and blacker than black as Batman. \"It\\'s not who i am underneath, but what i do that defines me.\" Michael Caine as Alfred, humorous, he is the rock of the Batman family. Almost always, the exchange between Bale and Caine where Christian tells him \"You still haven\\'t given up on me, have you?\" Caine answers \"Nevah.\" Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox. Quite different from the character in the real Batman mythology (which for me is the comic books), but important nonetheless. He\\'s told in the film as the one who supplies Bruce with all of his \"spilunking\" stuff. :) Morgan plays it brilliantly, from his face in the Tumbler while Bruce is driving, to his deadpan humor near the ending of the film. \"Didn\\'t you get the memo?\" That got one of the biggest laughs in the theater.Liam Neeson, Liam Neeson. Awesome! As Henri Ducard and the real Ra\\'s Al Ghul, he was cold, beyond reason. Cold, bad-ass in a great way. Esp. the scenes where he and Bruce were in their ninja suits playing a game of \"hide-and-seek\" with all those ninjas. Some of the best lines came from Neeson\\'s Ducard character. \"Are you ready to begin? Katie Holmes. She\\'s actually the \"weakest\" link as far as all reviewers or critics are concerned, but for a fan, well, she actually is. Not weak, but pretty much, the film could have gone without her. Having her die at the end of the movie would have made an even better way to start the Begins sequel given Batman\\'s occasional experiences with deaths that he feels responsible for. (i.e. the drowned girl in the VENOM series, Jason Todd) But she does put some nice boy meets girl syndrome during the early years of Bruce. (Oh, speaking of history, Bruce Wayne did NOT finish college nor did he finish in Princeton) And, imho, the end scenes where she and Bruce kissed was ABSOLUTELY YUCKY! i dunno, but for me, it was totally unnecessary but seeing as how the protagonist and the girl should kiss even once in a movie scheme held up, well, there ya go. \"You better run!\" Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow actually should have gotten more screen time. He was really scary even in his \"doctor\" mode. the first time we get to see the mask during his talk with Falcone, awesome. We really got to see the extent of how this lean, geeky fellow could actually become one of Batman\\'s worst enemies. Ken Watanabe, very limited screen time. Doggone good nonetheless.and who could forget...Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. \"I have to get me one of those.\" Damn right. \"I think you\\'re trying to help.\" Can\\'t wait for the next Batman sequel just for the fact that i\\'d love to see more of Jim Gordon\\'s interaction with the Batman.Overall, this movie gets a perfect 10 out of 5 stars :) This movie has it all. Great plot, dialogue, action, and an array of Oscar caliber actors, definitely, Batman renaissance has begun. Batman Begins.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : this was one of my favorite movies of the year. and i don't say that lightly. i saw this movie with my friend as a backup to lords of dogtown which was sold out and boy am i glad i did. Christian Bale did an amazing job with the tough role of being batman. i then saw this with my cousin who loved it as well. this is probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen. superman, horrible. batman, OK. spider-man the first one, OK. spider-man 2, boring. and so on. but this, this was amazing. it was well worth the 10 dollars to see it and i cant wait until it comes out on DVD. one of the best movies of the year and it deserves to be in the top 10.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : This is certainly, without question the best Batman film ever made, although that isn't saying much. Christopher Nolan makes this into a very dark and brooding tale that tells more about Bruce Wayne than Batman, something the other movies would never have done. Nolan is a great director and he takes a great leap of faith by showing perhaps the most important screen superhero in such a way that the city of Gotham and its components don't feel like taken from a comic book, but from real life. Batman Begins is based more on graphic novels and the original characters by Bob Kane, so the realism and details are there without all the fluff and showboating Joel Schumacher would have put out. Christian Bale is perfect as the title character and he creates a more interesting Bruce Wayne than Batman only because we see more of Wayne in this installment. All other roles are perfectly cast, especially Liam Neeson as a mysterious yet intelligent and brutal member of the League of Shadows. Katie Holmes is nice and sweet as Wayne's childhood friend, and there will never be another Alfred as long as Michael Caine resides.Simply put, Batman Begins is worth the time and money. It pulls you into a world you would never expect to see in a Batman movie, than transports you to Gothan City, the rotting core of it mostly. When we do get a glimpse of Batman, it really is quite different than other interpretations. The action here is based more on suspense than violence and the plot moves along quite well to make this movie feel shorter than its 140 minute running time. So, if you are going to see The Dark Knight this weekend, be sure to check this out first. Indeed, if it is anything like this one, this franchise is going somewhere truly spectacular.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : Being a fan of Nolan\\'s previous work, I went into this with high expectations, and yet somehow, my expectations were surpassed. My congratulations to the entire cast and crew for making such a phenomenal film.It all begins with the story. Nolan and Goyer didn\\'t just adapt from the comic book, they re- imagined and re-invented Batman and his world while staying true to it. I might even say what they did was in some ways better than the comic book. Things in the comic book that would probably seem preposterous in a live action film are brought to life in an intelligent way, like the reason for the costume, and the reason for the villains and their costumes. I won\\'t go too much into the story, because I think it\\'s best for people to go into this film knowing as little as possible.Christian Bale IS Bruce Wayne, and IS Batman. It will be hard to ever see someone else play the role. The look on his face when Joe Chill walks out of the courtroom... That demonic voice he gives Batman... The way he tries to hide his pain when he\\'s told that \"the apple has fallen far from the tree\"... an incredible performance. The rest of the cast is fantastic too, with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman dishing out some great humor.And the film looks great. Gotham actually looks like a real city (with nods to Blade Runner), the lighting is nice and contrasty, and Batman is believable as a flesh and blood character. Even the flying scenes are handled nicely. It\\'s hard to talk about this film without giving things away. If you haven\\'t seen it, please see do. You won\\'t be disappointed. I\\'d like to thank Warner Brothers for letting an intelligent and talented filmmaker make this film without much interference. Please make more like this one.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : Two Words: Batman Begins.The Batman franchise has been resurrected and it is better than ever. I can't stress enough on how good this movie is. Christopher Nolan directed (and co-wrote) a darker Batman that is portrayed perfectly by Christian Bale. A new youth and energy has been drawn out of the Batman legend and displayed perfectly. All of the performances in this movie are stellar, and each one does not seem out of place or pointless. The music keeps your blood pumping with the action and never lets up. And speaking of the action, you haven't seen anything until you see the Batmobile in motion. This thing is mint. I honestly wish that I could write something a lot better about this movie and go into great lengths of describing each piece of this glorious pie; but in all honesty, I will simply ruin the movies for others. I am not one to keep secrets. So please end my torment and go watch this movie. Then I will have people to talk to about it.\\n\",\n",

This is the best heroic movie ever produced, and it sets the stage to become the most phenomenal production the world will ever see.Additionally, Christian Bale is the best Bruce Wayne, and Batman I have ever seen on film. Although Michael Keaton was good, Bale exceeds his performance, and excels in this film with epic features and excellency in all aspects of heroism.I highly recommend this film to all, as it may be the best movie ever produced, in my opinion. Furthermore, Michael Caine is a wonderful supporting actor, and he makes \"Alfred\" impossibly believable during the film. He provides character to the Wayne family. Lastly, Katie Holmes makes a great appearance in this film, and has a strong character who tries to fight the impossible growing criminal society of Gotham City.\\n',\n",

       " 'Review of Batman Begins : To start off this review I\\'d like to go back to the original batman series. Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clichés, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman & Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze \"You\\'re not sending me to the cooler\", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it\\'s a shame it didn\\'t start off this way as it might not of died on it\\'s rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it\\'s not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne\\'s past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you\\'ve not seen it I don\\'t want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun. D-man.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : British director Christopher Nolan is better known for his lower-profile thrillers such as the excellent MEMENTO and the brilliant INSOMNIA, but his first big-budget Hollywood blockbuster is still in the same league as the other two: a tremendously inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking, which breathes a whole new life into the Batman saga and proves to be the best film of the series (shame it took till number five to get it right, but that's life). Nolan dispenses with any previous cast or story lines, instead taking Batman back to his roots, and the result is a tough, violent, realistic adventure which isn't marred by any of the comic-book campness or flights of fancy which spoiled the others. Batman is just an ordinary guy here, without any superpowers, but instead his Bond-style gadgets allow him to become the caped crusader by night.The casting is extraordinary and the ensemble all give outstanding performances. Bale is terrific, finally getting some of the acclaim he deserves; I've been watching this guy for a few years now and he's been great in everything I've seen. Caine is cast as Alfred the butler, and supplies genuinely warm comedy and wit. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are friendly allies, although their roles are relatively minor. Katie Holmes is the attractive love interest and she, too, is surprisingly good. However, it's the villains which have the best parts; Liam Neeson has his best role in many years and is fantastic in it, whilst THE LAST SAMURAI's Ken Watanabe is creepy as a cult leader. Cillian Murphy (28 DAYS LATER) is truly memorable as weirdo bad guy The Scarecrow, whilst Tom Wilkinson is almost unrecognisable as a hardline gangster. Even Rutger Hauer is in it, and that's gotta be good, seeing as he's been stuck in DTV movie hell for a decade.The film is long – 2 ½ hours to be precise – but the suspense and action keep it moving. There are car chases, fist fights, massive battles and lots of other stuff going on. The plot keeps you guessing all the way through and there are plenty of surprising twists. My only complaint is that the action is cut too fast, and too close, so that it's pretty hard to see what's happening, but the excellent soundtrack helps make up for that. Still, a minor complaint with what is otherwise a flawless film – let's hope they all team up to make some more classics like this.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : My only criticism of this otherwise brilliant movie is that it is a little too long. But it is an extremely good film, that along with the original Batman could very well be the best of the Batman films(thought perhaps just lacking the original film\\'s sophistication). People may find this blasphemy, but I did prefer this over The Dark Knight, but that was still very good. Christopher Nolan\\'s Batman Begins is stylish, dark and gritty, pretty much what Batman should be. I have seen complaints that the film \"contradicts\" the 1989 film. Perhaps so, but what I can say in the film\\'s defence is that Batman Begins is sort of a very loose prequel to the original movies.Visually, Batman Begins looks absolutely incredible! It could very well be the most beautiful visually of the Batman films, with beautiful cinematography and a simply dazzling view of Gotham City itself. Another asset I appreciated was that the music score didn\\'t overpower the action, in fact it gave some atmospheric flavour to it. As much as Danny Elfman\\'s scores were outstanding and definitely memorable, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard do a great job with the score.The script is taut and well-written with lines that really make you think along with some occasional offbeat humour, the plot isn\\'t convoluted or predictable but original, the film moves briskly(the second half was marginally better in terms of pacing to the first half though but that is in no way a flaw) and the action is explosive particularly the climax and the bat-mobile car-chase. Also Christopher Nolan\\'s direction is excellent.The acting, aside from the visuals is what drives the film. Christian Bale is for me the best Batman since Michael Keaton. In the role of Batman he is suitably dark and brooding, like Batman should be, and as Bruce Wayne, he is dashing, handsome and ambitious. Katie Holmes actually surprised me and in a good way. She wasn\\'t bland or annoying, I actually found her sympathetic and surprisingly good. Liam Neeson is also very good, though he has been better, while Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred. Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson and the excellent, underrated Gary Oldman are also solid in their roles, while Morgan Freeman is wonderful as always.Overall, a brilliant film that is visually stunning, gripping and atmospheric. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : I loved Batman and Batman Returns, Tim Burton's direction and Michael Keaton's Batman were really good, and seemed to be the best we were ever going to get.I'm glad to say that i was wrong, Christopher Nolan has taken the character of Batman to the very beginning, fleshing out the characters of both Bruce Wayne and Batman down to the finest details. Nolan's use of realism in the creating the Batman character makes him more believable than ever.Christian Bale quite simply personified the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman and actually puts everyone else's portrayal in the shadows. Bale is supported by a wonderful cast, including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and more, but i found Cillian Murphy's performance as Dr. Jonathon Crane to be one of the finest in the movie.Overall Batman begins is an very honest, detailed and compelling adaptation of the Batman character, that is worthy of the recognition it has received. For Bat fans and movie lovers alike; this is a must see.9/10\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : I've seen all the Batman movies. Most aren't that deeply lodged in my memory. I know that the scene stealers in most of them are the villains. This movie puts it on the strong shoulders of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The movie is about him and his ghosts and his baggage. It is about a man coming to grips with immense guilt. It goes into great detail to explain to us how Batman came to be. It has verisimilitude. The bad guys are, of course, really exaggerated in their evil plans. Everything is neatly plotted. There is fragility in both the character of Wayne and the city he and his family loved. Organized crime abounds and he must face it pretty much alone. I was quite impressed with Inspector Gordon (Gary Oldmann). He was believable and fragile, yet committed to what was right amidst a culture of evil (even on the police force). Like is so often the case, I can't speak for the people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when a movie doesn't follow their dictates; yet, I really was involved in this. This is quite an all star cast with excellent direction with a bleakness that Tim Burton also did well. I think it was one of last year's best films.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : I've never had a thing for Batman films. I watched the cartoons when I was about 8. That was alright. Nothing special though. And not to forget...I was only 8. I always thought batman is just not one of those things for me.This film however has changed my mind. I can't wait until the next one! Christopher Nolan presented an almost believable story in this 2:20 hour blockbuster movie. I especially liked the way Nolan described the fear of bats Wayne develops in his youth and the way his father was a big influence in his life. Casting was very good... Normally I would have given an 8 for this film, but because it was able to totally change my mind about the batman theme i think it really deserves a bit higher. That's why 9/10!!\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : Batman Begins, the much hyped, much publicised 'reboot' of the Batman franchise is finally here and boy what a treat it is! I was a big fan of Tim Burton's take on Batman, his portrayal of the dark knight as a brooding and reluctant bringer of justice, I always felt fit perfectly with the imagery of the comic books and gave a great feel to the whole Batman mythology. The following outings of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, were less than splendid though. Over-blown campy nonsense with two-dimensional characters being upstaged by a campy over the top rouges-gallery of villains.So here is the re-boot. The beginning. Batman begins breaks from the convention of other comic book films. The first act of the film is told through flashbacks and does not follow a linear editing style. It gives a fantastic insight into Bruce Wayne's feelings towards his origins and his motivation for becoming the Dark Knight. It traces his path from young boy, to troubled young man; unable to vent the anger he feels for injustice he has suffered at the hand of the criminal element.Bruce Wayne attempts to confront his demons head on, but soon realises he is just one man in a corrupt and frightening world. The film takes us on the journey Bruce endures in trying to find what it is he needs to do to come to terms with his past and to guide his future. He travels the world and seeks out a means to better himself both mentally and physically. He trains with masters of martial arts, to learn the fighting skills and mental strength he will require to bring justice back to Gotham. This all provides the very convincing back-story of the transition from Bruce Wayne to Batman.Without giving too much of the plot away, Bruce travels back to Gotham and begins his quest for justice. It shows how he equips himself and the conflict he has within when dealing with the criminals of the city. It also shows what other Batman films have failed to show. The trouble of living a double life when you are a billionaire playboy. Bruce has to find balance between his public image as Batman and his public image as a rich, businessman and socialite.The film climaxes with an awesome final act, showcasing immense fight scenes, brilliant use of the new Batmobile, gorgeous sets and intense acting. The final scenes set the film up perfectly for any sequels and all the while maintains the sense of realism and down to earthiness that Nolan promised.Batman Begins is well written, well-shot and combines amazing special effects, set design and acting to form a perfect final package. This is without a shadow of a doubt, the best comic-book movie I have ever seen. Christian Bale puts in a sterling performance as Bruce Wayne, often reminiscent of his role as a businessman in American Psycho. He is also very convincing of a man driven to fight injustice, a man with a troubled past and a man seeking what he must do to come to terms with it. He is also entirely convincing as the all-action hero Batman, disposing of criminals with his expert martial arts training enthusiasm for justice.The supporting cast is perfect. Michael Caine is an inspired choice for Alfred. There is good chemistry between him and Bale and you are left convinced that they have a quasi-father/son relationship and that Alfred genuinely cares for his young master. Gary Oldman plays a brilliant Sgt Gordon, the last honest copy, torn between misguided loyalty to the force and an honest will to protect the innocent. Cillian Murphy plays a reserved, but entirely psychotic proto-super villain and Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson, as always provide strong character roles. Holmes was a fine leading lady, but I couldn't help feeling she didn't really have enough to do in this film, however only a minor criticism.Batman Begins is a dark film, centred on strong themes of fear, over coming demons of your past and the fight for justice in a corrupt world. Unlike many comic book films, this film is not in anyway aimed at children. It is not strictly adult in nature, but follows intelligent character development, adult conflict and complex portrayals of the characters. Most comic book films introduce your hero as good because he wants to save the world and the villain bad because he wants to take over the world. Then the action begins. This is not the case with Batman Begins, it gives insight into each character's motivation and reasons for their actions, it does not expect the audience to blindly accept anything on face value.Well done to Goyer and Nolan for producing such an awesome movie. When I left the cinema, everyone in the audience was grinning at the end of the film, knowing they had just seen the beginning of something rather special. Bring on the sequels!\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : Last night, I went to check out Batman Begins, and I only have one word for the tone of this film: perfect.Absolutey nailed. Blasted out the park. A grand slam.The folks responsible for this adaptation of the Dark Knight simply \"got it.\" 100%.Batman is a persona that was created to inspire fear into the hearts of criminals. A creature of the night that hunts from the shadows, strikes without warning, and vanishes into the darkness like a nightmare. The character is never meant to be seen by the general public, he is merely meant to exist in their whispers, an urban myth that is talked about in hushed tones throughout Gotham City.Batman does not have a \"Bat Credit Card\", and he doesn\\'t attend charity auctions or débutante balls. He doesn\\'t drive around the city streets in the Batmobile in broad daylight, waving to cheering citizens. He doesn\\'t have a \"Bat Phone\" that connects him to the commissioner. He doesn\\'t wear a costume with rubber nipples or operate vehicles with spinning neon turbine engines and open cockpits. He doesn\\'t crack jokes like, \"It\\'s the car, right? Chicks dig the car.\" All of these things are wrong, wrong, WRONG...and this movie understands that. It understands that and washes all of these injustices away until they are nothing more than a faded bad memory. Screenwriter David Goyer and director Christopher Nolan have given us a film that treats the character with respect; a loud, thrilling masterpiece that doesn\\'t insult your intelligence or bombard you with inappropriate campy antics.Christian Bale gives us a Batman that will scare the living crap out of you. His voice is a gravelly, menacing sound, and when he yells at some poor schmuck to get some information, it\\'s downright terrifying. He swoops out of darkened alleys, hitting fast and furious. He\\'s brutal, cold, and calculating. In short, he\\'s everything that anybody who ever put that cape and cowl on is not. Perfection.The villains are also amazing, but a huge part of their contributions to the overall brilliance of the film is their failure to dominate it. The previous Batman movies were plagued by these cackling idiots in ludicrous costumes who pushed Batman to the back burner. In Batman Begins, we finally get to spend some time with the hero, learning who he really is behind the mask.Not to imply that the villains are poorly fleshed out or inconsequential to the story - quite the opposite in fact. Cillian Murphy is a very effective Scarecrow, turning in a subdued, but intensely creepy performance as a warped psychiatrist who uses fear gas on his victims, unleashing horrifying hallucinations. Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) is a shadowy Tibetian criminal warlord named Ra\\'s Al Ghul, who watches over young Bruce Wayne\\'s training with Ducard, played by Liam Neeson. But things are not what they appear with this situation, and a shocking twist comes into play towards the climax. The rest of the cast is solid, especially Gary Oldman, who finally gives us a competent, intelligent James Gordon. Essentially, the movie is about fear. Confronting it, learning from it, using it, and conquering it. It\\'s a dark, serious film that leaves little room for humor, but some sneaks through in the form of some witty exchanges between loyal butler Alfred (a brilliant Michael Caine), and Bruce Wayne.This movie is awesome and a complete triumph for DC, Warner Brothers, Nolan, and everyone else involved.. Run, don\\'t walk, to the theater. Amazing.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : Well, it\\'s official. Batman has gotten his balls back. This film is dark, extremely dark. So dark in fact, there are a great number of scenes filmed, I kid you not, exactly like a horror film. Now, I\\'m a huge fan of the \"real\" Batman movies. You know, \"Batman\" and \"Batman Returns\" which were done by Tim Burton, starred Michael Keaton, and were carried along by Danny Elfman\\'s rousing musical score. Let\\'s not forget, that old Batmobile from those films. This tank-like monstrous new Batmobile may very well be the coolest car I\\'ve personally seen in a movie in ages. Of course, if you\\'re a fan of those rather putrid, embarrassing \"other\" Batman films (Forever & Robin), then you may very well not like this movie. Because it doesn\\'t totally suck like those films did.Basically, this is the story of how Bruce Wayne thought of, created and became Batman. In a nutshell. However, it also tells, in the most personal way, of his struggles with the concepts of justice and vengeance. It shows us how he trained to become the ultimate fighter of evil and corruption. It introduces us to a different villain from the previous four films\\x97and does a mighty good job of it, too. Even as a side note\\x97we\\'re introduced to good old Commissioner Gordon\\x97before he\\'s police commissioner. So then, it also tells a bit of his \"beginnings.\" We see the beginning of the Batcave and find out just how Bruce Wayne was able to, to quote the Joker, \"\\x85get those wonderful toys.\" On top of it all, if you ever thought Michael Keaton was the only person who could adequately, correctly portray Batman on screen, you just may change your mind here\\x97I never imagined Christian Bale would do such a remarkable job.Here\\'s the breakdown:The Good:--The action is fast and brilliantly choreographed.--The dark mood is finally back\\x97the way Batman is supposed to be\\x97it has even less \"camp\" value than Burton\\'s films!--The Batmobile, as I said, is incredible\\x97and has some great sound effects to boot. Supposedly, it was designed by the same person who created Keaton\\'s Batmobile.--Christian Bale is so good, he almost causes you to forget about Kilmer and Clooney\\x97thank god!--Michael Caine\\'s powerful performances\\x97he\\'s the major player keeping Bruce Wayne\\'s humanity in check. More so than Katie Holmes, whose performance, while good, was a tad weaker than Caine\\'s in this respect. She did an interestingly good job as a tough lawyer, however.--Bits of comic relief here and there\\x97that don\\'t ruin the movie!--Brilliant atmosphere.--Excellent acting all around.--Not claustrophobically over-crammed with \"Batman\" villains like the last two films. The only major villain is the Scarecrow, and another character whom I\\'ll leave up to you other movie goers find out.--Excellent tension.--Fantastic cinematography.Didn\\'t Hurt It, Didn\\'t Help:--The music is good, but for those of you out there like me\\x97you may miss Danny Elfman\\'s beautiful score.--Gotham City is not as Gothic as it should be. However, the film has slightly more modern twist that makes it more \"believable\" than the previous films. Especially those last two, which, if you haven\\'t guessed it by now, I hated.--Early on, the story deals a lot with flashback sequences\\x97a couple are a bit confusing as to where they belong chronologically. They may have indeed been chronological, but only seemed like a steady story with flashbacks. Still, it gets the point across.--The film seems to be set-up as either a new Batman series, or a prequel to Tim Burton\\'s original Batman. I guess I\\'d be happy with either\\x97so long as they keep Christian Bale and don\\'t sell out to that campy crap again.The Bad:--Scarecrow seems a bit underused.--We had to endure \"Batman Forever\" before we got to this brilliant piece.The Ugly:--We also had to endure \"Batman & Robin\" before we got to this. \"Har har, ICE to zee youuu!!\" Ugh!Memorable Scene:--Batman and Scarecrow\\x97talking \"face to face.\"Acting: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Character Development: 9/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 (there is none) Violence/Gore: 8/10 (a lot of violence, yum yum) Dialogue: 9/10 Music: 8/10 Direction: 10/10Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 9/10I finally went with a \"9\" over a \"10\" for these reasons alone: Scarecrow, to me, was a little underused; and I missed Danny Elfman\\'s music. If you loved the first two films, you\\'ll love this. If you loved the third and fourth films the most, well then, you sir, belong in Arkham Asylum and apparently hate movies. Everyone else\\x97go see it.(www.ResidentHazard.com)\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : yet again we have been treated to a true tour-De-force powerhouse movie that stands very tall with its head held high!!!!!! the only movies that have really got hold of me and given me a real sense of enjoyment (comic strip adaptations this is) is this and the x-men movies.BATMAN BEGINS the movie....the film starts with a young and innocent Bruce Wayne and its not long until you see why he ended up fearing bats they way he did and as the film progresses you get to see the reason why his parents are murdered and what affect this has on Bruce as he grows up full of hate and unforgivingness, as a result Bruce travels the globe in the hope that he will learn to understand the common criminal and therefore know how to combat them, and this is where he bumps into Liam Neeson who teaches him the ways of the ninja and other ways also in combating \"evil\" and you can guess the rest. the trick to this film is that you don\\'t get to see batman at all for about an hour and the wait is really worth it, you get the lot in this movie... humour, sharp serious dialogue, great action, great actors and acting... but again the only down side to this movie is that pesky camera work in the fight scenes and it really annoyed me and made me feel a little dizzy at times, but when you look at the film as a whole you do tend to forgive this one and only discrepancy!!! he he..................9/10 for the film and would have been 10 but for the camera work.BATMAN/BRUCE WAYNE...where has this man been hiding he he, been a fan of bales for a wee while now and i was looking forward to him playing this, but i didn\\'t realise how effective he would be, as the educated and mega rich teenager/business man he pulls this off with such a grizzly swagger and realistic charm you just have to love the guy...i am so glad that Christian bale was aloud to play the character as dark as he did, with so much conviction and because of this you really feel the hate/confusion that runs very deep through him........awesome! 10/10 for me!ALFRED the butler..... has Michael Caine ever been more suited to a character than Alfred??? i find it very hard to find any that come close, the only other one is probably peachy from \"the man who would be king) with Sean Connery, the humour is bang on and really delivers the dialogue with real exuberance and is a delight to watch, witty, sentimental, and has the look of a real butler you could believe to be......10/10 again.COMISSIONER GORDON.....it is very rare when you get a Gary Oldman performance so perfectly played down as this, if you are a regular at the cinema then you will have no problems identifying him but if you\\'re not you could very easily miss him altogether. Gary plays Gordon as the typical family orientated policeman who is just trying to survive in what is a real crap hole of a city in \"Gotham city\" where most of the cops are corrupt and the quality of people living there a quite unnerving to say the least.....you don\\'t get the usual Gary Oldman here and just occasionally i would like to have seen just a little bit more of the actor i know and though i didn\\'t get it i loved his character all the same......9/10 HENRI DUCARD/RHA\\'S AL GHUL.......Liam Neeson is consistently showing some REAL heavyweight performances in Hollywood at the moment and this is just another feather in that bow, for the first hour of the movie nearly all the best scenes had him in them, and was by far a better villain than any of the other batman villains in previous movies put together....this was a man with real issues and real hatred for corruption and lawlessness and his conviction in this movie made me go WOW on more than 1 occasion he he.....what a towering impression he gives when he is being forceful especially during the sword fighting scenes....awesome....apart from sounding a bit like Qui-Gon Jinn in some spots ( still sounded cool just too familiar if thats the right way of putting it) he was cock-on!! 9/10 MORGAN FREEMAN... though this guy is always Mr reliable he was never allowed to shine as much as you hope for in this, purely because his character isn\\'t that big but what you do get you just know you like... he he.CHRIS NOLAN/ director....well, well ,well! this is excellent directing, the pace of the movie is spot on, the feel he gives you with both the scenery and the dark harsh Gotham city is quite exquisite. you do get lots of shots at like side profile and the use of these angles with shadows over the faces and body positions give you the sense of that you are watching a very dark and gritty movie and right from the get go you know that this is never gonna be like the originals as we know them! the only gripe i have is the use of extreme close up camera work when you get the fights on the go, i know they want you to feel like you\\'re in e the fight but by doing this you lose the beauty of the the action scene and choreography between the actors. because of this i will go 9/10 i hope this is useful to some people and i URGE YOU ALL TO SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE ITS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT......its much better!!\\n',\n",

       " \"Review of Batman Begins : This movie is truly inspiring to us Batman fans out there. It's hard to believe that Christian Bale once weighed 130 lbs for one role and then shot up to 220 lbs, before trimming down to 190 lbs for Batman. This man is truly devoted to his work and it shows. Just look at certain interviews about how he portrays the character Bruce Wayne. It's almost as if Christian Bale does research and takes notes on Batman before he starts acting the part out. He makes all the right moves because he surrounds himself with a great group of actors. We can all relate to Bruce Wayne's character in some way and this is where we can thank Bale. Who else could've done it better? BATMAN IS BACK THANKS TO Christian BALE! I just hope the best is yet to come and he sticks with this role.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : This is the movie The Hulk wanted to be, and failed miserably - the story of the man that turned himself into a legend. While Hulk failed on every conceivable level, though, this \"Batman\" succeeds.Although comparing Burton\\'s Batman to this one is an exercise in tedium (both are great movies, although they satisfy different types of moviegoers), it may be enough to say that, while Keaton portrays Burton\\'s Batman, Christian Bale is the comic book superhero. Keaton has an edge while showing off Bruce Wayne\\'s strange and weird attitude, while Bale is absolutely amazing while depicting Batman as a man, driven by rage and hatred, who is willing to die to find inner peace.The only weakness I could see was Gotham city. Burton\\'s vision of a future / past Metropolis is unsurpassed - his dark, menacing city is oppressive and hopeless. The new city can\\'t approach the old one\\'s power.Strangely enough, I found the actual \"Batman\" scenes not as satisfying as the whole Bruce Wayne transformation sequence. And the new Batmobile looks as if Batman has gone SUV-crazy - not a good thing (at least to me). Who cares - this is the Batman we thought we had lost ever since Keaton abandoned his mask.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : It\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve seen the Tim Burton Batman films, heck, it\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve seen this one when it first came out. But after seeing all three of the Dark Knight incarnations under Christopher Nolan, I\\'d have to say that his vision best defines the comic book character that evolved over the past decade. I never cared for the campy Adam West version of the mid-Sixties TV series, and even looking back at the early comic book stories, the appeal of the character was always geared more toward a kid\\'s eye view of good guys triumphing over bad guys. With \"Batman Begins\" the character enters the adult world as a complex hero/anti-hero with conflicting emotions and a motivation in precarious balance between justice and revenge.Before the film came out I didn\\'t know much about Christian Bale, and upon first viewing he didn\\'t seem right for the Batman role, but watching today I think he fits it rather well. The only thing is, I\\'m put off somewhat by the look of the cowl that covers Batman\\'s face. It\\'s the one thing that hearkens back to a cartoony feel about the character and it\\'s somewhat distracting for me. In fact, the whole idea of a rubberized Batman suit seems antithetical to the the early comic stories where the look of the character appeared more natural. One has to wonder how a real person would be able to move around in something like that.But when it comes to super-heroes, I enjoy origin stories and this one does it right. Beginning with the murder of Bruce Wayne\\'s parents right up through his training under Ra\\'s al Ghul, one gains an appreciation for the dedication and determination required to become a skilled warrior. Not to mention the mental and physical conditioning required to block out pain and exhaustion, an important element in creating the character.In addition to Bale, I found the supporting cast to be quite effective in their roles. Particularly intriguing was Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane. He didn\\'t have as much screen time as some of the other players, but that crazed gleam in his eye made him believable as the founder of Arkham Asylum. Katie Holmes looked a bit young to be portraying the assistant DA of a major city like Gotham, but that could just be me. I liked Michael Caine as Alfred, a worthy collaborator in the Batman mystique and a trusted friend and adviser. All the rest were good too, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, and Rutger Hauer - all exceedingly competent and well cast for their characters.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : After being disillusioned by just about every comic book \"blockbuster\" of recent times, Batman Begins comes as a nice surprise. The film draws a lot of visual inspiration from Blade Runner and looks all the more impressive for it. The storytelling is done at a decent pace, giving each stage just enough time to have an impact before moving on. On the acting front Michael Cane as Alfred steals the show serving as the comic relief. Katie Holmes is a bit disappointing but her role is largely forgettable. Christian Bale does an excellent job of re-imagining Bruce Wayne, even if he doesn\\'t look quite right with the mask on. Just goes to show, with this and Sin City looks like Hollywood can do Comic Books.....\\n',\n",

So i don't want to make this long.I went to the Wizard Wolrd Comic Con on Saturday June 4th and they had a special showing of Batman Begins at the IMAX theater in King Of Prussia. Well.. It was Awesome. I am a huge comic book fan and this made me very happy. It is on par if not better then Batman 1.The movie has a scene here or there that is only so so, but you forget about that by the end. Anything they change in history is easy to forgive too because it works so well and makes a lot of sense.All the actors did a great job. I thought to many big names would be bad.. i commend you ALL... i knew Christian and Gary would be perfect and they WERE.. Katie, Michael and Morgan i was worried about (no offense to them, just for the roles) and they did awesome. Katie Holmes actually really did a great job. I gained a lot of respect for her abilities.Overall.. SEE IT.. i would have been willing to pay so much to see it early and getting a free showing made it that much sweeter. I have to see it again on opening night and then a week later for my brothers last night as a free man.. and i cant wait... GET OUT THERE AND SEE IT.. well.. when it opens :) THANK YOU to all who made this movie happen.. you really gave a great film that will hopefully get the taste of the last two (i know.. new franchise) out of our mouths.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : Christopher Nolan and crew are to be commended for a job well done. If you are moderately interested in Batman, perhaps enjoyed the first film or two but was appalled with Schumacher\\'s take on the series, you will love Batman Begins for its return to the darker, more serious side of Batman. If you are, however, a true Batman fan (by that I mean you have read your share of Bat comics and genuinely appreciate the character), this film will blow your mind.First off, let me say that Goyer and Nolan do take a lot of \"artistic license\" with the origin story; though is such a thing possible with a story that has been retold countless times? Anyway, there are a lot of new ideas thrown into the mix of Bruce Wayne\\'s struggle - and subsequently, a lot of dimension.The mission of Batman Begins is really very simple - to bring a sense of realism and maturity to the Batman tale.When I say realism, I do not mean it is realistic. How could it be? But the film approaches the subject with the question, \"Okay - what if it WERE possible?\" And the suspension of belief works well.But besides all of that, what is really important about this film? Christian Bale. He MAKES Batman work. Never before has any television or film truly captured the intensity, the ferocious growl, the unstoppable passion that Bruce Wayne has.And this is a film about Bruce Wayne, not Batman. Which is why it works so well.I think this film would not have been possible, perhaps, without Spider-man\\'s birth to the screen. Spider-man revolutionized superhero movies, gave some credibility to them. It showed the world that, in order to make a movie about a superhero, you have to instead focus on the alter ego - the real person.But Batman is a little trickier than Spider-man, I think. You see, the twist to this character is that, the Batman IS Bruce Wayne. Wayne the billionaire is the mask. Perhaps this seems a little simple, but the film really takes a hard look at it, and shows us two different Wayne\\'s. This Batman does not require his costume in order to be Batman.There\\'s a wonderful scene that shows an interaction between a little boy and the Batman. Batman attempts to stay hidden as he clings to a building in an alley, spying on a villain attempting to get rid of criminal evidence. The boy emerges from his beaten down apartment, parents yelling at each other in the background. He looks out on his rugged balcony, then catches a glimpse of the Batman - right next to him. Instead of rushing off, Batman just kind of shares a moment with him, silent at first, and the boy says with hope, \"I knew you were real. No one else believes me.\" Bruce watches him a second longer, then hands him a device from his belt and disappears. This wasn\\'t the cheesy, super-hero interacting with adoring fan type scene. It was almost like two kindred spirits, the hero feeling the child\\'s pain and reaching out to him. The thing that is so wonderful about this version of Batman is that, while he appears heartless, he\\'s actually full of compassion. And it isn\\'t just the dorky super-hero type \"calling\". It runs in the family. We learn in the film that Bruce\\'s great grandfather helped slaves escape to the North during the Civil War. We see perhaps one of the deepest renditions of Bruce\\'s father, Thomas, as being a strong, compassionate and loving father, who\\'s saying sticks with Bruce all his life: \"Why do we fall? So we can pick ourselves back up.\" Michael Caine does a riveting job as Alfred, much more masculine (in a gentlemanly way) than past incarnations, a bit more youthful and definitely more agile. His fatherly influence warms the heart and makes us treasure every second with the character (though it might just be because of Caine, who is a phenomenal actor). Think of a \"Second Hand Lions\" type Alfred.Then there\\'s the love interest (if you can call it that), Rachel. Honestly, I understand why they put her in here, but she really has no point to the story. She\\'s not the reason he becomes Batman. She doesn\\'t stop him from being Batman. She\\'s just kind of there, a convenient voice from the past. Really, any of her scenes (aside from the kiss at the end) could have been given to Alfred, and it would have worked better. But being that she\\'s actually such a small part of the film, it doesn\\'t bother me that much.I won\\'t go into the villains, because I can\\'t say much there without giving it away. I will say, though, that they are again, very much based in realism, not in comic color poetry. There are a wide variety of villains in this film, and at the end, the promise of one very special foe in the sequel.This film ends on a definite note of continuation, as even the main titles suggest it (the title \"Batman Begins\" doesn\\'t even flash until the last scene has rolled). But it works, because you knew that was coming anyway, right? Personally, I feel this film is a much more mature comic book film than Spider-man, Superman, Fantastic Four, X-men, etc. will ever be. While not realistic, Batman Begins is BELIEVABLE, and I will definitely be frequenting the theaters quite a bit this summer to see this movie again and again.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : This film is absolutely Outstanding! Its nails the character,the world he inhabits and everything around him Beautifully. I couldn\\'t have hoped for a better and more cinematic experience. To call batman begins the first perfect batman live action movie would be true but a complete understatement. This is still easily one of the greatest comic book films of all time and the most thorough origin story that I have ever witnessed. The film explores everything that previous live action incarnations either never could or never thought to. The first thirty minutes of the film don\\'t feature Batman at all but instead the audience is acquainted with Bruce Wayne as both a child and as young and troubled man. He is portrayed by the amazing Christian Bale. The audience develops a Intimate bond with him the way that we have never seen before. The rest of the cast is absolutely magnificent. Liam Neeson is brilliant as Bruce Wayne\\'s martial Arts master. He inspires Bruce when he is at the most vulnerable point in his life. The training sequences in the snowy mountains are some of the most memorable parts of the movie for me. What impeccable screen writing! Michael Caine was born to play Alfred. The relationship between Alfred and Bruce is beautiful. You can tell that Alfred is the closest thing that Bruce has to a father. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman is beyond excellent as Jim Gordon. Finally the character Gordon has a say so in these movies. Cillian Murphy is Fantastic as the evil Scarecrow/Jonathan Crane. The weakest link in the film is Katie Holmes but she still does a good job for the most part. Her characters relationship with Bruce is very engaging even if she doesn\\'t have much chemistry with Bale. Also she gets to deliver one of the best lines in the film \"Its not you who are underneath but what you do that defines you.\" The film is gripping unlike any Batman story that you have ever imagined. The film is dark and gritty but not merely for the sake of being dark and gritty. This has a meaning story about a young man who uses a fearful symbol to exact vengeance on the criminal underworld. The character grows and matures as the film progress from a victim of fear and tragedy whose world was falling apart to a fully fledge unstoppable hero that makes the criminals fear him. The Hanz simmer score is masterful and in my humble opinion the best ever put in a batman film animated or live action. This movie is a masterpiece and underrated by fans of its slightly superior sequel The Dark Knight.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : I still remember going to this movie and having no Idea what I was about to see. A buddy of mine wanted to see it, and I knew absolutely nothing about this movie. I went with expectations to see something along lines of another Batman movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger making a second appearance.Boy was I surprised. From the start I was hooked. This was like no other Batman I had ever seen before. It was not cheesy jokes, cheesy sets, cheesy cast, nor cheesy costumes. This was done Dark, and Dirty, and real. Well as real as a fiction movie about a super hero can be. You could say it was 100% plausible. This movie was the second best movie of the trilogy with the Dark Knight being first.But this movie was more important. It was the game changer the led the way for the Dark Knight.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : You know the story, you know the outcome, but nothing is lacking here. Thank God, even Rutger Hauer underplays his part - how good is that? The cast is perfection (yes Katie Who? does a fine job) and I won't mind looking forward to the sequel, the remake of the sequel, whatever they will call it. Bring the Joker on. Makes a real case for the fact that the right cast means absolutely everything. This is entertainment and comic book characterization come to life. Christian Bale's Batman makes Ben Affleck's tortured Daredevil character look absolutely ridiculous (sorry, maybe that is really not giving Christian enough praise - he deserves all he gets). Since we are in for a few more years of comic books as movies dominating the scene, I vote for more like this - made for adults, not children, with superb casting, and Hans Zimmer (with the help of Lisa Gerrard, maybe Moby, and the like) scoring the music. I felt that in no way was I cheated here - unlike so many other movies that I see where the corners that are cut are bleeding so profusely that you can't help but notice. See this on the big screen. Worth every moment.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : Well, first off, I must say; Bale, as mentioned before, is perfect as Batman. His acting performance in the movie is just outstanding, therefore my high rating. The movie itself, plot, dialogs and so on, its nothing out of the ordinary, but then you start to think about those 90\\'s Batman movies. This just seem more realistic, more \"Bruce\" than \"Batman\" and with the perfect acting from Bale, it makes all other Batman movies look really dull and daft. They managed to put in a few funny lines as well, Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman gave the movie that extra \"casual\" yet serious, although funny touch to it all. I am impressed, more Bale, more Batman! Continue in style.danrozen,swe\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : This, the first part of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is as much about how and why billionaire Bruce Wayne became Batman as what he does once he has; in fact he doesn't don the bat suit until an hour into the film. In the prologue we see a young Bruce Wayne fall into a well where he is terrified by the bats he disturbed; creating a life long phobia. The first time we see him as an adult he is in a Himalayan prison; he is released and invited to train to become part of an organisation called the crime fighting organisation; League of Shadows. Upon completing his training he learns that the league's methods are radical in the extreme... they intend to destroy Wayne's home city of Gotham and everything in it because they believe the world needs to be cleansed of its corruption. Gotham is indeed a corrupt city but Wayne is determined that it can be saved. He returns home and uses the resources of Wayne Industries to create his Batman persona.This takes almost to the half way point of the film; in the second half we see him start his fight against those corrupting the city; the first person he goes against is local mobster Carmine Falcone; he may be the city's best known mobster but unbeknownst to him he was working for others; the psychiatrist Dr. Crane used Falcone to smuggle psychotropic drugs into the city; he used these to experiment on patients at the Arkham Asylum in preparation for the attack on the city being planned by the League of Shadows. If Batman is to thwart the League's plans he will have to confront his deepest fears and risk losing everything he has. He has few allies; just a policeman, Sgt. Gordon; his butler Alfred; Assistant DA and childhood friend, Rachel Dawes and demoted company researcher, Lucius Fox.Before watching this put any memories of the camp '60s TV show or the '80s films out of your minds; this is a complete reboot that is in no way connected to them and tells the story from the characters beginning. The first half of the film is less action packed as it deals with how Bruce loses his parents, struggles to come to terms with that loss and is trained by the Henri Ducard of the League of Shadows... this doesn't mean this section was any less interesting; in fact I found this to be an essential as it gave us the necessary insight into Batman's motivations rather than just expecting the viewer to accept that Bruce Wayne likes to fights crime dressed as a giant bat. The second half is packed with plenty of exciting action and it is fun to see some of Batman's famous gadgets; especially the new and imaginatively designed bat mobile. The gadgets aren't overdone though; he doesn't always have just the right piece of highly specialised kit!The cast is full of top quality actors including Christopher Bale as Bruce Wayne, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman and Rutger Hauer... but it doesn't feel like an 'all-star cast' film where everybody gets a chance to show off; each of the cast plays their part well without overplaying it. This has a far more realistic feel than previous Batman films; the villains are entirely human without over the top mannerisms or camp costumes and because so much time was spent introducing the Bruce Wayne character he is the real character and Batman is just a costume he wears and even that is given a practical justification. I'd certainly recommend this to fans of intelligent action films; even if you don't usually like superhero films this one is worth checking out.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : Anything I say about this film will sell it short. I was originally skeptical when I saw the Urban Assault Vehicle in the trailer, but my fears were calmed when I saw it in context. Everything about this film is perfect - the acting, the directing, the mood, the plot, and all else. It is rare to see such intricate storytelling mixed with bone-shattering intensity in the action department. And fans of the comic will not be disappointed with this apt translation.I hope Chris Nolan directs all future Bat-movies, because his lighting and architectural canvasing was so perfect, it outdid Tim Burton's interpretation (which I previously thought impossible). As of this review, IMDb has rated the movie #117 of all time, and I agree completely. This film has universal appeal. Christian Bale is perfect as Bruce Wayne, Katie Holmes actually acts for once in her career, Liam Neeson is the quintessential villain. Other stars shine brightly. I can only hope that Crispin Glover becomes the Joker in the sequel. Highest possible recommendation...\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : I was lucky enough to have seen the premiere of the movie on Monday evening and I was very impressed. This is easily the best Batman movie I have ever seen. This movie completely disregards the previous 4 Batman movies and begins its own franchise. The scenes are dark and foreboding, as is Batman himself. This film makes the previous 4 Batman films look as campy as the old TV show. There are no wild costumes or over-the-top freak characters. Scarecrow's costume consists of nothing more than a burlap sack yet it is more effective than the ridiculous outfits worn by Mr. Freeze or The Riddler in the last two terrible Batman movies.The movie is outright action. The fight scenes are realistic in that there are no stupid one-liners being dropped during the fight, nor does the fight pause for one of the characters to crack a cheap joke. Christian Bale is the best Batman I have ever seen. The supporting cast is incredibly strong; with especially solid performances by Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Liam Neeson and even Gary Oldman (who I have been very critical of in the past). I hadn't seen much of Katie Holmes before this film, but her performance was every bit on par as those of the seasoned veteran actors mentioned above. Lastly there is Cillian Murphy, whose performance reminded me of the chilling characters played in the past by Christopher Walken. I can see Murphy becoming a much bigger name in film in the near future.This was not a children's' movie in any way, though the film is not overly violent or gory. I don't recall seeing any blood at any point in the film. I saw many parents bringing children to the premiere, but I believe these people were expecting a movie like the previous 4 that added corny jokes and enemies that bordered on slapstick with their appearance.The movie distances itself immediately from the others by showing the audience a different version of Bruce Wayne's parents being murdered. The origin is told well and gives us a much better insight on the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman. This Batman is realistic. We see how he is trained and hear what his beliefs are. He even bruises and looks athletic without looking TOO big to hide his appearance when not in costume. I applaud Christopher Nolan for breaking out on his own and not submitting to the campy formula of the other movies.I would gladly see this movie again in the theater. It looks to be the best film of the summer and easily the best film I've seen this year. Because there is no sex or gratuitous violence the film is okay to take the kids to, but don't expect them to be as entertained as they were with the previous films. At no point does this film even pretend to be targeted at a younger audience.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : \"Batman Begins\" is the best batman film made so far. While Tim Burton\\'s 1989 movie is already a box office classic, Batman Begins has all of the gritty power that made Batman famous in the first place. Chris Nolan has done what Tim Burton and Joel Shumacher couldn\\'t do, which is make a comic book film true to the actual comic. While Nolan\\'s direction is amazing David s. Goyer\\'s script is great. The film starts with a tortured Bruce Wayne traveling the world, when he meets his soon to be mentor Henri Ducard played by Liam Nesson. his training wins him a spot on Ra\\'s Al Ghul\\'s League of Shadows. Bruce decides to pass on the proposal and heads back to Gotham. Soon we see Bruce transform into a fierce hero bent on cleaning up his city.The film\\'s supporting cast including Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine make Batman Begins far more than just a kids movie. The only mediocre part of the film comes as Katie Holmes\\'s performance as Rachel Dawes. Other than that, this picture is worth watching over and over again.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : Finally, after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader, the Batman franchise is back on track. Having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the Dark Knight, I was especially disappointed by 'Forever' and 'Batman and Robin'. To me, these film lost the essence of what drives Bruce Wayne to do what he does and turned Batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero.Thankfully though, Nolan has gone back to the roots of the character, portraying a confused and angry Bruce Wayne, who ultimately rises to become Gotham's greatest champion. Don't expect to see loads of shots of Batman in this film though. It is the story of Wayne and focuses mainly on his years of training and preparation for becoming Batman. You are almost teased throughout the first half of the movie, waiting to see the excellent Christian Bale in the costume, as it keeps holding back to keep you in anticipation. When Batman does finally turn up on screen, it is well worth the wait. In my opinion, Bale was born for this role and for the first time when watching a Batman film, I enjoyed the scenes of Wayne being Wayne as much as Wayne being Batman.One of the strongest features of the film, is the way that it manges to suck you in believe that a 'Batman' could be a reality one day. The technology is current, with no use of silly OTT weapons and gadgets, again making the film work by today's standards. Plus, we are not allowed to forget that Batman is still just a man under the costume and there are times when he gets a bit of a kicking and shows that he can be vulnerable too, something we sometimes forget when watching a superhero flick. Gone too, are the silly villains!!! Jack Nicholson was the perfect Joker but from there it went downhill. Thankfully, in this movie the bad guys are actually fairly 'normal' and manage to be menacing at the same time.Which finally brings me to the cast. I always had high expectations for this film when the cast was announced. Let's face it, what a line up! Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katy Holmes, Ken Watanabe and Tom Wilkinson are not to be sniffed at. Even an old favourite of mine makes an appearance: Rutger Hauer! Awesome. Actors of this calibre would never have gotten involved in this project if they didn't have faith in Christoper Nolan's talents and thankfully they took the leap...For the comic book fans out there, waiting to see this movie, let me assure you that you won't be upset. Imagine the darkness of the 'A Death In The Family' and the 'Year One' story lines. I have never met a fan of Batman who didn't love these books. Well, this is the kind of Batman you can expect from Bale: Dark, brooding and tortured by his past, yet the hero we have come to love. For those of you who are not comic fans, then just look forward to seeing how Batman should be. This film is a credit to Bob Kane's original vision and a testament to all the talented artists and writers who keep the legend of the Dark Knight alive in the comic books today....Thank you Mr. Nolan and thank you Mr. Bale. In fact thanks to everyone who worked on this film. Batman finally Begins from here....\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : Batman Begins was a massive breath of fresh air when it came out in 2005. Coming 8 years after Warner Brothers jumped the bat, as it were, with Joel Schumacher\\'s childish mess, \"Batman and Robin\", Christopher Nolan\\'s Batman Begins brought a maturity and seriousness to The Caped Crusader that had been absent since Tim Burton left the world of Gotham. While Batman Begins might not boast the visual prowess or rich villains of Burton\\'s two Batman movies, it fleshed out the character of Bruce Wayne in a way no movie has since.Batman Begins is an origin story straight through, detailing Bruce Wayne\\'s (Christian Bale) emergence from tragically scarred child to a symbol of heroism and darkness. After training with Ra\\'s al Ghul and the League of Shadows, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham in perfect mental and physical shape. What Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer do perfectly here, is inject Bruce Wayne with an emotion never before seen in a Batman movie. You can feel the pain and grief Wayne is experiencing and you can see why he decides to become a living symbol of good. The first full origin story for Batman on film, Batman Begins is very much told from Bruce\\'s point of view. Earlier Batman movies often focused more heavily on developing the villains, leaving Bruce Wayne in the shadows. The approach that keeps Batman a dark, mysterious figure is a valiant one, and it makes sense. However, context rarely hurts, and Batman Begins provides the character with heaps of context. You can clearly understand the emotions and motivations of the man behind the mask. The origin is also utterly believable. You can see why Bruce Wayne dresses like a bat, why he needs a cape, how he gets a super-car and super-gadgets, and why he hides in a cave. Does it strip Batman of his mythic status? Yes, a bit. Luckily, unlike Nolan\\'s two follow-ups, Begins doesn\\'t get too carried away with realism, retaining a comic book style that its successor would forget.While it does take a while for Bruce Wayne to fully become the bat, it is worth it. Once Bruce Wayne finally dons the cape and cowl, there are a few jaw-dropping action scenes including a brilliant batmobile chase scene and a thrilling climax on Gotham\\'s elevated trains. The atmosphere and feeling of Gotham City is nearly perfect in it\\'s own way. It does not have the Gothic beauty of Tim Burton\\'s Batman universe, but it\\'s blend of comic book dinginess and contemporary sleekness makes Gotham a terrifically realized cityscape. The city feels like what a comic book world would be like if it actually existed. Batman himself is a dark, brooding, wonderfully realized character in his own right and he shares the screen with an ensemble of great actors. Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon are standouts in an ensemble cast that is playing the comic book material straight as an arrow. Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow is an excellent but criminally underused baddie, but on the whole, the supporting cast elevates the material.Batman Begins is still as fresh today as it was more than a decade ago. The origin of Batman is engaging, engrossing, and emotional. The story provides a context to the Bruce Wayne character that elevates the movie beyond its fun comic book plot. The origin is a satisfying and believable one, and once Batman finally enters the scene, the action is unmatched. Batman Begins is a strong, confident summer superhero blockbuster with more maturity and emotional truth than most dramas. I hesitate to call it the definitive interpretation of Batman (Batman 1989 takes that title), but Batman Begins is the best of Christopher Nolan\\'s Batman movies, a film that balances gritty realism, human drama, and thrilling comic book fun.85/100\\n',\n",

       " \"Review of Batman Begins : I've just come back from a preview screening of Batman Begins. I went in with low expectations, despite the excellence of Christopher Nolan's previous efforts. Talk about having your expectations confounded! This film grips like wet rope from the start. I won't give away any of the story; suffice to say it mixes and matches its sources freely, tossing in a dash of Frank Miller, a bit of Alan Moore and a pinch of Bob Kane to great effect. What's impressive is that despite the weight of the franchise, Nolan has managed to work so many of his trademarks into a mainstream movie. The story does not progress in linear fashion for the first half, and there are some truly spectacular hallucination scenes. Parents thinking of taking their young kids along, think twice. When we left, a terrified 8-year-old boy was being comforted by his parents. Some of what's up there on screen really is the stuff of nightmares.Of the cast of Brits chosen to bring this American tale to the masses, Christian Bale convinces in his dual role, while Michael Caine as Alfred comes up with the humour just when the film is in danger of taking itself too seriously. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson provide able support, as does Morgan Freeman. Most refreshing of all is the way that Nolan and co have come up with a way of bringing comics to the screen that does justice to the often adult source material in a way that, say, Daredevil, tried and failed to do (although the director's cut is better). If the Dark Knight doesn't return after this, there's no justice.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : Director Christopher Nolan is rebooting the Dark Knight with a ever darker style. It is faux realism. He starts off with the death of Bruces' parents. After not able to kill their killer, Bruce is in a Chinese prison where he meets the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul. It is the anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi. His message is a dark perversion of Justice. When he returns to Gotham, he invents Batman.There are two things that keep this from an even more impressive start of Nolan's Batman Trilogy. The first is Katie Holmes. She is not up to the task. She is still playing that little girl character from Dawson's Creek. She doesn't have the seriousness or gravitas to play this gutsy lawyer character. It's a big character, and not just another girlfriend.The second is that Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) isn't a big enough villain. The evil plan has too much of a silly Bond feeling. It is too unrealistic in a Batman movie that is suppose to be realistic. It leaves a bad taste for the climatic ending. Other than those two, this is still a great start to the trilogy. It sets the tone for the final two.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : Forget all that colorful, candy coated, over-the-top, comic book style trash that poisoned the last two Batman movies. Joel Schumacher should be embarrassed for creating Batman Forever and Batman & Robin which became the ultimate low for the character since his creation in 1939. This new film thankfully has nothing in common with those embarrassments. Batman Begins is a prequel to everything we have seen before. It takes us back to young Bruce Wayne as a boy. The film has a very dark, gritty feel to it. In fact, I found it hearkening back to Tim Burton's unique style found in the original Batman movie with The Joker and Batman Returns with The Penguin and Catwoman. If you liked those then you will love this new one. I think it is even better.Without ruining it for those who haven't seen it the new Batman Begins shows the transformation that took place from young Bruce Wayne to Batman. It truly recaptures what the original story about Batman was meant to be. You witness the initial training, the beginning of the bat-cave, the early gadgets, and of course crime fighting at its finest. All of this is carefully executed to keep your attention and entertain you without overloading you with special effects and other Hollywood tricks. I dare say it may be the best Batman film ever made. Sequels are on the way of course.\\n\",\n",

Christian Bale is absolutely brilliant in this he owns Batman in this film he shows how Bruce Wayne became Batman and shows the emotions behind his crusade. He makes Bruce Wayne the main character not Batman. This realism is what makes the film so revolutionary it is by far the most realistic superhero film I have ever seen. Batman doesn't defy the laws of physics, Gotham isn't an over blown fantasy it looks as it could really exist in the states and the villains aren't fake people there real criminals. The cast is brilliant and its not dominated by American's with the exception of Holmes and Freeman. The main cast, the major characters are all British/Irish brilliant actors none the less. The writing in this tale is also masterful as it is heavily influenced by Frank Miller and other Batman comics. This is a film you need to see however you can.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : What we see in this movie is the \"dark & gritty\" (TM) Batman, which was introduced by Frank Miller in 1986 in the comics mini-series Dark Knight Returns, which was an alternate future version of Batman. But Miller also gave the \"real\" comics Batman the dark & gritty treatment in the seminal Batman: Year One story, which is perhaps the greatest Batman story ever created (also because of the effective artwork of the excellent David Mazzuchelli), and which chronicles, among other things, Bruce Wayne\\'s initial (pre-Batman) martial arts training in a remote mountain region. In the comics, a creative force as strong as Frank Miller was bound to yield massive imitation by less original comics creators - and so the early 1990s saw the Batman character getting consistently and increasingly dark & gritty, to the extent that the entire Batman universe was based on that darkness and grit.So the question is, does this work in a movie? Well, in my opinion it didn\\'t even work in the comics, so, no, for this and other reasons I don\\'t think it works in the movie, either. I always preferred the pre-Miller Batman, whose comics were driven by the stories and not simply by mood and style.Batman Begins is not a bad movie. It has many good things. The story has lots of great ideas. Most of the changes to the Bat-mythos were thoughtful and effective. I even loved how the Batmobile had to jump over a moat every time it left and entered the Bat-Cave.Unfortunately, the movie is atrociously directed. Everything is much, MUCH too dark, and considering how bad-looking the terribly cut fight scenes are, the fast-moving action and scatter-shot dialog are particularly grating. Most characters beside Bale\\'s and Neeson\\'s don\\'t have enough to do, or get no significant characterization. Oldman\\'s Gordon is wildly underplayed, and I could never separate Michael Caine from Michael Caine, which I needed to do if I were to find him convincing as Alfred. I think the structure and editing of the movie was terrible, and the decision to make a comic-book movie so dark that you could hardly see what was going on, was a monumentally bad one. It was a decision made, no doubt, to emphasize the medium of the movie over that of the comic, and it made the director attempt to create some kind of art movie - and apparently many people feel he succeeded. I didn\\'t.And I thought the special effects were another big problem. There were too many of them. Why did the plot need a hallucinogenic drug, so faces could twist and horses could breathe fire? Because, I\\'m certain, the movie-makers felt they had to deliver the special effects spectacular that they thought superhero movie audiences have come to expect. A commercial decision, thus, to blow some dough on unnecessary SPX, just because the audience probably would think it was a cheap and unimportant movie if it didn\\'t have any. So, no, I was not impressed at all; rather the opposite.And unfortunately I have to make one more serious complaint. Ra\\'s Al Ghul was very cool and very well played and everything, but his scheme was ridiculous in the extreme. Through centuries and even millennia his \"league of shadows\" (the actual size of which is never shown) would destroy civilizations (oh, or just cities) at the height of their decadence, like God striking down Sodom and Gomorrah. And now they\\'d decided that Gotham City should be destroyed? I\\'m sorry, but I find it ridiculous on at least three levels. First, wouldn\\'t they target more than a single city? What use will it be to destroy one city? But, of course, this would depend on their man-power, which we are never made privy to. Maybe they\\'re just, like, twelve guys. It certainly looks that way. Second, Ra\\'s had been planning to destroy Gotham for, like, twenty years or more?! So, basically, he\\'s been focusing all his resources on just Gotham for at least two or three decades, while events in the rest of the world has had no bearing on the situation? That\\'s preposterous. And third, where\\'s the sense in going in to help exacerbate the decadence and crime and corruption before delivering the death-stroke? They are totally becoming the very thing they would destroy. And sure, they\\'re the bad guys and all, but shouldn\\'t their scheme have SOME modicum of logical coherence? Apparently not. So anyway, not a great, successful movie as far as I\\'m concerned, but the typical commercial fluff with a hurried narrative and a holey rusted plot, Batman.6 out of 10.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : I never thought Christian Bale could displace Michael Keaton as the best batman, but, sorry Michael, the deed is done.Batman fans should find no surprise in the darkness of this tale depicting the early life of Bruce Wayne, his transformation into The Batman, and one of his most harrowing adventures. I avoided reading reviews before seeing this. As a lifelong comics fan, I felt this film deserved an open mind from me. After seeing one of the trailers, I became convinced that this film was going to be based on Frank Miller's The Dark Knight, a legendary take on the 1930s Batman origin story inked in the 80s by the man who later gave us Sin City. But no, this is a fresh and original Batman film, including the significant elements of the original, but adding its own very carefully thought out embellishments. While it has all of the darkness of The Dark Knight, it has all of the plot elements of the original, and more.The familiar Batman story is told early in the film, but by the time we are allowed to focus on Wayne, he has grown into a young man. Wayne is depicted as a troubled drifter whose traumatic early life has left him seeking understanding in all of the wrong places. Bayle plays the character to the hilt - with his detachment, repressed anger and heavily depressive tendencies sustained throughout the entire film. Susceptible to any guidance that might provide him with a chance to right the wrongs he has seen, he falls under the spell of Ra's Al Ghul high in the Bhutanese Himalayas and becomes an apprentice in the League of Shadows - a secret society of ninjas who purge the world of corruption in a merciless manner. Wayne's martial arts training is where the major story arc begins.This is easily the most serious, intelligent, and adult of the batman films. It is well filmed, relentlessly fast-paced and intelligently scripted. Batman Begins also sports a phenomenal cast. I am aware that a few people felt that Katie Holmes was miscast as Rachel Dawes, but I couldn't agree less. She did a good job as, basically, the only woman in the film. The rest of the cast did not miss a beat either. The very likable Michael Caine makes a great Alfred, though I have to admit I was concerned when I first saw him on screen (having never gotten over some of his weaker efforts).With Sin City and Batman Begins coming out in the same year, it is easy to imagine that - after decades of struggle - the comic media has finally successfully broken into serious commercial films. Let's hope it's here to stay!\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : This is probably the best Batman movie to date, because it wasn't flashy like Joel Schumacer made in the last two. Also it wasn't extremely dark like Tim Burton made the first two. The cast lived up to my expectation which were very high, like they all for all movies. Now George Clooney sucked as Batman, so did Val Kilmer, Michael Keaton was good, but Christian Bale rocked. He had the charm of Bruce Wanye, and the badassness of Batman. Michael Caine as Alfred was just so genius, and putting Morgan Freeman in the movie was just amazing. He (Morgan Freeman) was just so great.So all in all I highly recommend fans and non-fans to see this movie, you will be amazed at the depth of the story and just the pure greatness of the way it was crafted.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : First of all, I have to say that I enjoyed the previous Batman series, directed by Tim Burton for several and then by Joel Schumacher. As good as that series was, this start of a new series would fall flat if all it does was copy the last one.But this series (and it will be a series it seems) certainly has its differences. It was less fantasy based and more realistic. To be sure, Batman still does some pretty amazing things. But this time, at least some of it seems more believable. At the start, Batman even loses a few fights - at least as Bruce Wayne. And he even seems to have a few fears. And Gotham City, almost appears to be similar to a real city. This Batman is more realistic, somewhat similar to the Spiderman series that is also going on. In both cases, the audience knows that the hero is still human and actually has a chance of losing and is concerned about that.This realistic approach works, and works well. Not only did our group greatly enjoy the movie, but we are very much looking forward to the next ones in the series. The acting, casting and direction were well done. And of course the action was both creative and fun - as one might expect.The premiere that I went to see was not as crowded as one might expect. However, those people that were there stood up and applauded at the end of the movie. One seldom sees that.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : I don\\'t worry and obsess too much about \\'superhero\\' flicks. I just expect them to suck and take what enjoyment I can from them. So the relatively high quality and watch-ability of \"Spider-Man\" and \"X-Men\" was a great surprise to me, since I had fully expected them both to be lame, camp, and stupid. But instead, both flicks were well made films with warmth, dignity and humor, as well as being pleasant tributes to the memories of decades of entertaining stories and the comic book creators who made them.\"Batman Begins\" continues this great tradition. It manages to include almost everything the fans love about the character and his alter ego - the cape, the gadgets, the Bat-Mobile (more of a Bat-Tank, but still), the urban backdrop, the disturbed and disturbing villains. And it does all this while still being a crackerjack movie - the quality of the production, the acting, the soundtrack and the cinematography are Sky high.What\\'s really wonderful about this version of Batman is that there are some major Hollywood actors involved in this, but every one of them treats the material with gravitas and respect. But at the same time, no one chews the scenery or over-does the drama. Neeson and Caine are especially great in this respect. No one can instill dignity and humanity into a potentially silly or goofy scene like Neeson.(Hell, he almost saved \\'Episode One\\' all by himself.) Here, he just punches the humanity and also \\'larger than life\\' quality of the proceedings into the next level. And Micheal Caine is, well, Micheal Caine. He\\'s effortlessly wonderful as Alfred, as good in his way as Micheal Gough was in the previous versions of the franchise.I think it is obvious that while Tim Burton is a wonderful, whacked out visionary (and God Bless him for it), Nolan is in fact a better director for this more naturalistic material.I was very pleased to learn that Christian Bale would be the new \"Batman\" - after watching him in \"American Psycho\" and in \"Equilibrium\", I was pretty sure that he would have just the right qualities for the part - he\\'s built like a brick, and he\\'s got the 1000-yard stare and the \\'lights are on, but nobody\\'s home\\' qualities that the character demands. And man, he is good in this. Micheal Keaton is a wonderful actor, but Bale seems to have been BORN to play Batman.I can\\'t give this a perfect \\'10\\', because it\\'s a superhero flick, for crying out loud. I save \\'10\\' for stuff like \\'Bambi\\' and \\'Deliverance\\'. But this is really, really, really good.\\n',\n",

Michael Caine gave a great performance as always as the Butler. He really brings energy to a movie.Morgan Freeman too is good as always but his part needed to be bigger. He is one of my favorite actors and I thought he was good in this movie too.Kate Holmes. She is another cute and sweet actress that I personally love to see in films.

Everything you like about movies is in here. Great acting, amazing effects, a rich plot, and having a cute Defense Attorny helps too. I don't care what people say, Katie Holmes getting engaged to Tom Cruise didn't have anything to do with the success of this movie. She's just a good actress. Christian Bale is THE Bruce Wayne and always will be (except for Adam West of course). Michael Caine is a great Alfred too. The Scarecrow is the greatest psychological bad guy since Norman Bates.

       " 'Review of Batman Begins : The movie focuses on Bruce\\'s childhood where he gets his haunting memories from. It shows how he was to become the prince of Gotham, but things do not turn that way. How he wastes some years of his life and then suddenly how he understands the aim in life. The movie certainly satisfies the viewers that how he actually becomes a batman, and from where he acquires his skills and the stuff which is required. Well if this is a beginning of a \"james bond like series\" then it really is a very good start, otherwise, well it certainly does not cover the whole part of the story. I can say that in comparison to the other \"such movies\", the movie starts a little slow, but for fans like me, who think the more explanation the better, I can say that is this movie is much better off. Well, to be critical some of the objects in the movie do not conform to the actual comic book story, but for a part like that, I suppose they cannot have a thing like that in real. Other than that, a few details are also messed up, but then depends on how well you have read those comic books. On the whole, I can say for fans who just cannot get enough in just 2 hours out of good movies, this movie (and its sequels) are just extravagant.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : The action sequences are tedious, overlong and boring. The whole nonsense with the ninja gang in Asia is a jumbled ridiculous mess. Best part is the assembly of the batman stuff, but the car is also a very uncool contraption. The long car chase scene with is pointless. Katie seems lost. The first 40 minutes or so goes by rather slowly and is of little interest. The fight scenes are not well done, difficult to see what is happening, and of little interest.This is a potentially good indicator movie for me, and I really need one, with the high percentage of loser movies coming out nowadays. If a critic loves this I can chalk that up to poor judgment.While Mr. & Mrs. Smith is totally mindless it is actually a lot of fun, is exciting for most of it.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : A well made action film, especially of its sort, it constantly tackles below surface ideas, such as justice, fighting crime, fears and corruption, while at the same time the film offers exciting action on the surface. The visual effects are very effective, and the overall visual style suits the project very well. Cillian Murphy is worth noting for an intriguing performance, even if the rest of the cast members only act adequately. The film is somewhat slow to build up, focusing on some of the story elements for too long, but once the film gets going, it is superb. There are certain imperfections that one generally accepts in these types of movie blockbusters. Yes, the on screen romance is dull, but at least here it is not a useless subplot. Yes, some of the characters are inserted just for laughs, and not to add anything to the story. Yes, even some of the necessary characters have pointless moments of comic relief. Yes, the special effects tend to go over-the-top here and there. However, do all these points really matter? If you are expecting a flawless masterpiece then they do, and you will not find such a film here. But, if you just want to see an action film that is a cut above the rest, this is a great example: a film that is engaging both below as well as above the surface.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : I enjoyed the movie, and I thinks it is worth of the good rating in IMDb. The plot was good enough and I even liked the first half of the movie. But here and there there were things that just felt wrong, here is a short list from the top of my mind (and from the worst to the least):1. Close combat scenes. It was very hard to understand what was going on, wobbly camera, darkness and fast multi angle cuts adding to the confusion. Almost as bad as in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Only reason I can think is that Christian Bale didn't wan't to learn to act hand to hand combat. But in most of the battles he is wearing the bat-mask (and fighting masked enemies) so they could have used a stunt double to do the dirty work. Go figure, maybe it's just a close-combat directing fad.2. Microwave-machine that can vaporise water many yards away... ... but vaporises nothing water based (blood, anyone?).3. Undestructible Bat-tank Running through 20 inch concrete wall that is designed to stop vehicles from running through it (being in between of the lanes...). No way something that flimsy could do that, no matter how high-tech it is. Can't say for sure but I think it even went wheels-first to the walls. Some wheels there. And it wasn't even made to break walls, but to jump over rivers.4. Tricycle-Bat-tank There is a reason wheels are usually located in the sides and near the corners of a vehicle, it's called stability. And if it was meant for for rough terrain bridge building, no wonder army was not interested. That thing would topple over at the first sight of a slope.5. Gun in a courthouse Bruce was able to smuggle a gun in to a courthouse in a crime-infested town? I can understand the assassin (bribing and all) but Bruce? Maybe he did some heavy bribing off-screen.6. Grapple-gun Okay, just a minor rant here, it is one of his trademark toys so no way to exclude it from movie no matter how ridiculous it is. Rest of the Bat-suit and accessory was well portrayed (maybe excluding the bat-throwing-stars), even the armor was told not to be bullet proof.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : It seemed the past few years many things began ... again. Yes Superman returned, but it was a beginning too. Batman begins is one of the best efforts of this latest craze that emerged. And the director is playing a key part in this.Christopher Nolan is of course not the only man to \"blame\" on the success of this reinvention and of course re-birth of Batman (after part 3 and 4 you could be excused, if you thought it was over for Batman)! Where the new Bond (21st installment) was about to throw away the complete history of Bond as you knew it, Batman \"just\" reinvented the style of the two first movies. Yes I liked the first two Batmans, but I do also think that Nolan\\'s Batman is better. Beginning by the costume (completely dark, instead of having something yellow on his chest, that would be like an easy target to shoot at) and goes on, with the man behind the mask. Beautifully played by Bale, who is supported by a great cast! A great drama with action in it ... what do you want more?\\n',\n",

Of course, Tim Burton is not behind that one, so it\\'s definitely not an \"artistic\" movie like Batman I & II, but the cast was great and I thought that the plot was really good. Christian Bale is definitely convincing, and with Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy (oh my god, so gorgeous!) and Gary Oldman (funny, I didn\\'t recognize him...) in the same movie, I don\\'t really know who else we could ask for, they\\'re all simply brilliant! The movie is pretty long but time passed really quickly, and I liked the alteration of action, jokes and deeper stuff, like the introspection that is bound to happen. I only rated it as an 8 and not more because there\\'s a point where you have to compare that one to Batman I and II, which were both 10 in my opinion, and this one just misses that artistic touch that only Burton masters... I don\\'t want to say more because every batman fan (I & II at least) should see this one, and I really hope they like it as much as I did!\\n',\n",

       " \"Review of Batman Begins : Christopher Nolan undertook the difficult task of bringing back Gotham's savior and managed to pull it off in style. Nolan's tribute to the 'Caped Crusader' is a clean break from the twentieth century franchise that included Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney donning the mask of the great DC comic detective. The chiseled Christian Bale takes on the mantle of the 'Dark Knight' as Nolan delivers a gritty, edgy and, dare I say it, more realistic Batman than his predecessors, who inadvertently ended up making a parody of the superhero and his exploits. Bale delivers a troubled and dark Bruce Wayne who in is complexity is more credible then the Bruces of the past. As Batman, he fits the mold although his delivery could use some work.Cillian Murphy is far too pretty to play an arch villain like 'The Scare Crow' who, surprisingly, didn't pose much of a threat and would be laughed at if considered a true nemesis. On the other side of the tracks is the world's favourite girl next door, Ms. Holmes, who still looks like she belongs at the creek. Though their efforts are both apparent and commendable, they still come across as children caught up in a game for grownups.Michael Caine brings emotion, humor and charm to the character of Alfred the Butler as is Gary Oldman believable as the helpless but good, Sergeant Gordon. The original Hitchhiker is back too, with Rutger Hauer's convincing portrayal of the ever so sinister Earle who runs Wayne Enterprises until Bruce comes of age.Liam Neeson's performance is the big surprise in this movie of all stars, which also includes Oscar winner Morgan Freeman and Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe from 'The Last Samurai.' The audience can always expect a great performance from Neeson but in this flick he really hits the mark especially with the physical demands of his character. Not to be out done by the other heavy weights, Tom Wilkinson, also an Oscar nominee for 'In the Bedroom, is up to par in his performance as the immoral underworld boss, Carmine Falcone.The action scenes are shadowed by darkness, literally. The audience doesn't get the opportunity to fully appreciate the fights mainly because they take place under limited lighting. On a brighter note, it's enjoyable to see how Bruce Wayne actually transforms into 'The Batman' albeit is at an accelerated pace. With the combination of a worthy Batman, a great cast, a plot that's not totally predictable and a more REAL and gritty feel, 'Batman Begins' is an enjoyable feature that leaves you waiting anxiously for the next installment.\\n\",\n",

Batman's super powers are not so super, and the treatment of the mental and spiritual nature is more in depth. I liked the tie between the childhood fears and the batman character. It was refreshing that there was no 007-style comic relief. Top performances by Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. The art direction was solid, but not as great as the Tim Burton films. The movie gets 8 stars because it is a great movie only in its own universe of super hero movies. It does not really tell a universal story--only a story about how a guy becomes a superhero, which of course is make-believe.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : Set in the fictional city of Gotham, Batman Begins tells the story of how Bruce Wayne became what he was destined to be. Jumping between Bruce\\'s child-hood to his adult life, then to present time, this movie shows what influences and experiences affected his decision to become the Dark Knight of Gotham, a story which a lot of people don\\'t know. This movie is for anybody who\\'s ever wondered \"Hey, how did this bat guy get to be so good at man to man combat? Or, where did he get all those gadgets and that bat mobile? Or, why did this guy just decide to dress up and fight crime? Or even, why choose a bat?\"Now, not being a huge fan of the Batman franchise (especially in the last 10 years) and even knowing that Christopher Nolan was directing, I didn\\'t expect much from this movie. I was thinking to myself \"Oh brilliant! Another Batman movie, another weak idea for a comic book movie, another excuse to make a high budget movie jammed with loads of CGI and explosions. How could anybody possible think they would be able to milk anything new and unique out of a franchise that has been squeezed dry by almost every star of Hollywood and still hasn\\'t had any real success?\" Very open minded I know, but how could you not be skeptical? However, I was most pleasantly surprised. Unlike your typical comic book movie, Batman Begins avoids the temptation to include those cheesy awkward moments and one liners that make you nauseous. But, this movie was anything but typical; it was the most original and down to earth comic book adaptation in years. The storyline actually made sense and was believable, unlike the other movies, it never leaves you thinking \"But why was he\\x85 or But how can he\\x85\" The acting was convincing, Christian Bale had just the right persona to give the effect of a man with a lot on his mind and a lot bottled up inside him. Morgan Freeman was his calm, cool, collected (and very smooth) self. Michael Caine did a good job in his type-cast role as Alfred the butler, and Katie Holmes\\' performance was better than expected. However, the most refreshing and skilled new actor in this movie, in my opinion, was Cillian Murphy in his role of Dr. Jonathan Crane, who seemed to be the wild card of the cast as he was the only actor who has previously only had cameo roles in films \\x96 but he did an astounding job of his role. I am positive we will be seeing much more of him in the future. The directing was superb; the use of lighting and camera angles really gave Gotham that gloomy and dark feel about it. The moral of the film: We fall down so we can pick ourselves up again seemed completely valid in any context and was completely relevant in the film. But the best part was\\x85 No nipples on the bat suit! Unlike previous installments in the Batman franchise, this is not a kid\\'s movie. It is darker, deeper and more down to earth than all the rest. But it is welcomed by me and I\\'m sure the majority of the people in this large, movie loving world.Overall I would give this movie 8 out of 10 stars, because at the end of the day, a superhero movie can only be so good. But it is great cinema and it is wished that skeptics (as I was), may give this film a chance.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : As the title hints, \"Batman Begins\" is not a sequel to the three (the latest previous attempt doesn\\'t count) recent installments featuring the Caped Crusader, but rather a new dawn that unabashedly ignores any established precedents. The end result is as intended, breathing brilliant new life into a series that had unfortunately become a laughingstock.The script\\'s blueprint invigorates the film. Because of the audience\\'s general familiarity with the title character, \"Batman Begins\" is able to concentrate on his origin and motivations rather than the crime fighting itself. Like \"Superman\", the best superhero movie ever, the film spends a significant portion of its running length on the how and why instead of the what. We observe the fears and struggles that Bruce Wayne faces, which simultaneously humanizes him and heightens his mythic status.This course of action is primarily executed over the first ninety minutes, during which a depth beyond the typical perfunctory introduction of motives is established. Batman\\'s fearsome aura, the source of his power in both the fictional world of Gotham and the real world of moviegoers, is detailed, resulting in a movie more fascinating psychological thriller than standard adventure flick, although the action scenes still shine, one Batmobile-charged chase in particular. Eventually of course the inevitable protagonist-antagonist showdown evolves, and then the movie deteriorates slightly, but by that point \"Batman Begins\" has reached such heights that neither the slight come-down nor occasional cinematic conveniences and niceties (why the kid?) derail the picture.Aiding in the climb to excellence is the best supporting cast of any Batman film, filled with respected and recognizable faces who nail roles as they suitably show more restraint than many in the prior versions. Cillian Murphy is extra creepy as the the shady psychologist Dr. Crane; Liam Neeson authoritative as Ducard, Bruce Wayne\\'s mentor; Gary Oldman, even though you half-expect him to go psycho at any moment, evokes an excellent world-weariness as Detective Gordon; Michael Caine adds strength to the butler Alfred; and Morgan Freeman as Batman\\'s pseudo-Q is...well, has Freeman ever been anything less than superb? Other talented actors like Tom Wilkinson (crime boss Carmine Falcone), Ken Watanabe (the enigmatic Ra\\'s Al Ghul), and Rutger Hauer (the business head of Wayne Enterprises) round out the predominantly male cast interestingly loaded with Brits. As the mandatory female love interest, Mrs. Tom Cruise...er...Katie Holmes, is fully adequate and attractive, although her part could have been played by numerous actresses.All that talent matters little if the man behind the cape and cowl falters. But Christian Bale never wavers in either portion of his role. I\\'ll say it...Bale is better than Keaton, Kilmer, or Clooney, combining the best of the two former actors. As Bruce Wayne, he surpasses Keaton\\'s charming playfulness and Kilmer\\'s suave businessman with a twinkle befitting the younger man. As Batman, Bale possesses a masked intensity that blows away all of them, embodying the tortured soul through menacing facial expressions and a daunting physical presence that none of his predecessors maintained consistently.Beyond an omnipresent score (from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard) that is unrelenting but still mostly unobtrusive, a solid script and high production value lay the foundation from which the aforementioned excellent work is built. With the feel of a ridiculously polished (as it should be for $135 million) independent film, the Chicago-based Gotham City is edgier and darker than \"Batman Forever\", but grittier than Tim Burton\\'s noir-ish films. Those were bleak by design, while Batman Begins seems to draw its bleakness from beyond mere physicality, from a hope-starved story that matches its dismal yet chimerical backdrop. Instead of the fact-based world of Spider-man and his New York City, Batman and his Gotham sport a fantasy-laced makeover that better allows for distinctions between good and evil. While moral murkiness fits some films (\"Mystic River\"), superhero flicks work best with clear-cut distinctions. By creating a city with a sense of elevated reality, director Christopher Nolan and company imbue \"Batman Begins\" with a stronger soul that thrives on the film\\'s dominant theme of fear, compounding the movie\\'s allure.All aspects collectively tap into the mysterious and powerful Batman myths better than any other movie in the franchise. We now know not just who and what Batman is, but how and why he exists.Bottom Line: \"Batman Begins\" is the best on-screen incarnation of the Dark Knight yet. A high 8 of 10.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : Batman redone. It gives us a new origin of Batman (Christian Bale) and how he got his powers and such. He still plays playboy Bruce Wayne while fighting evil as Batman. His first two villains are the Scarecrow (Cillain Murphy) who produces intense fear in his victim with a gas and Ra\\'s Al Ghul--who trained Batman and knows ALL his weaknesses.OK--it\\'s MUCH better then Tim Burton\\'s dreadful movies but I still wasn\\'t too impressed. I didn\\'t like the new origin at all and it\\'s a full hour before Batman even shows up! It does have good parts--Bale is dead on perfect as Bruce Wayne AND Batman. He also pumped up for the role (we have at least two shirtless scenes). It LOOKS great (if very dark) and it has elaborate special effects left and right (with tons of explosions thrown in too). But I was mostly bored. The training sequence at the beginning just went on endlessly--it was more like The Shadow\\'s origin than Batmans. Also this movie was WAY too heavy on darkness and atmosphere. At one point it was raining and I noticed nobody in Gotham pulled in their clothes from their lines. This isn\\'t nit picking but obviously it was all out there to add an \"atmosphere\" to the scene. Also when you find yourself worrying about little things like that the movie just isn\\'t doing its job (i.e. entertaining you). However Batman\\'s costume, the Batcave and the Batmobile are all explained pretty logically.Acting varies--Bale was just great. Michael Caine (as Alfred) matched him. Even Katie Holmes (a limited actress) was good--too bad she won\\'t be in the sequel (this inexplicable romance/marriage with Tom Cruise is destroying her career). Laim Neeson was very dull as a teacher--he appeared to be drugged out. Gary Olman was (suprisingly) terrible as Jim Gordon--he seems VERY unsure of how to play the role. But Rutger Hauer, Linus Roache (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Bale) and Morgan Freeman were all great.To be totally honest I looked at my watch more than once. I couldn\\'t wait for this thing to get over. All the praise this is getting is beyond me. I give it a 7--and that\\'s mostly for the acting.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : I attended the 6:35 pm showing Wednesday (opening) night at a suburban multiplex in Minneapolis. It was a very sparse audience of mostly 50 to 60-year old men, some of whom had dates of equal vintage, which seemed like a very odd audience for this type of film. Perhaps it was the day and hour, but it certainly wasn\\'t the audience I expected. Though better than the most recent \"Batmans,\" this visually impressive actioner fell a little short. In this prequel we learn how Batman came to be, starting with a nightmare. Stuck in an Asian prison at the base of a glacier encrusted peak, Batman-to-be Bruce Wayne awakes from a flashback of his childhood, where he fell down a well and was terrified by swarms of bats. Orphaned when a common thief kills both his parents, Bruce embarks on a personal journey for seven years. Inter-cut with his former cosseted life as the only child of a doctor mogul, is the quest of this current young man, living among criminals in order to understand how their minds work so that he may someday vanquish evil. Now imprisoned for some criminal act, he rather quickly frees himself, lured to the aerie of Ra\\'s al Ghul. There he undergoes ninja training by Ducard (Liam Neeson) who spews aphorisms more akin to Steven Segal than the Dalai Lama. Much mumbo jumbo later, Bruce Wayne evolves into a skilled killing machine, only to reject the role of executioner of bad guys, and membership in the elite League of Shadows, the position for which he was groomed. He burns down al Ghuls house and returns to Gotham to fight evil on his own. Constructing his Batman persona and superstructure with the aid of his wise and loyal butler, Alfred (charmingly played by Michael Caine), Bruce Wayne becomes Bat-man because it symbolizes a fear he has conquered. As he reacquaints himself with Gotham he eventually finds that his father\\'s company, its legacy chairman, most of the Gotham police, and Ra\\'s al Ghul are all tied into the dirty workings of Gotham\\'s king of corruption, Carmine Falcone. When Falcone has the man who murdered Wayne\\'s parents killed to prevent him from testifying against Falcone, Bruce confronts him for fostering corruption. It is then Bruce quickly learns that insulting Falcone only puts those he loves, Alfred and his childhood girlfriend, Rachel, at risk. The conflicts between all parties are satisfactorily entangled in a heinous plot to destroy Gotham, and is then skillfully unraveled by Batman with truly impressive action sequences. But it only gets fun after a long 55 minutes into the film when Bruce finally gets a handle on himself. Until then the film is a bit tedious. But when the super toys roll out the basement of the Wayne corporate office building, the thrills are non-stop. Morgan Freeman plays a wonderful cameo as purveyor of cool technical gadgets, including one helluva Batmobile. Unfortunately, many of the bons mots of the film are lost to poor enunciation on Bale\\'s part. While Caine, Neeson, Oldman, Freeman, Holmes and just about everyone else in the film speaks clearly, Bale lets the words sort of fall out of his mostly open mouth. Only after he dons the slick iconic body armor of Batman does Bale close his mouth and enunciate. Hard to believe the oral transformation was part of the movie\\'s dramatization, but one can only hope. While most of the dialogue is workman-like, spare, and to the point, it becomes almost ludicrous when the characters presume to say something \"deep.\" Most notable are when Neeson, early on, delivers his melodramatic utterances, and, toward the end when Holmes proffers the truly incomprehensible gibberish about the Batman person who she loved and might someday see again. On a more positive note, Holmes put in a genuinely adult dramatic performance, which suggests a successful transition from TV darling to serious big screen actress.\\n',\n",

       " \"Review of Batman Begins : The movie is pretty great. Is quite brilliant how it explains the way Bruce wayne learned to fight and all the abilities Batman has, where and how learned the escaping techniques and all that stuffs. Its nice to see how he is becoming Batman, and acquires all the weapons the instruments and the bat suit. The bat mobile is quite impressive!! it is not a car, is a tank.....amazing. One of the other thing that really stand out are the characters. All of it has a very well defined paper, and the performance is spectacular. Michael Caine doing Alfred is really good. Christian Bale rolling Bruce Wayne is really good too, but what is most spectacular is that he gives Batman back that darkness he has lost in the last two horrible movies, Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Because that's what Batman is; is a Dark Hero. The only thing that didn't like me was that the person who killed the parents of Bruce wasn't the Jocker, so ins that way they didn't respect the original story.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : Tim Burton made Batman look a bit childish in Michael Keaton's figure, and were always beaten by his great villains in both Batman (1989) and the fabulous sequel. But then suddenly Joel Schumacher decided to trash and destroy everything that was cool, stylish and fascinating about the knight of night. So he made Val Kilmer do Batman and topped it all in 1997 by making the horrifyingly bad Batman & Robin that included a terrible Arnie as the main bad-guy.Christopher Nolan, the man behind MEMENTO and INSOMNIA decided making a whole new start to the famous story of one of the most beloved superheroes of all time. BATMAN BEGINS offers a totally new and inspiring gem into the whole Gotham setting. And Nolan ends of his trilogy of psychological settings here; were MEMENTO were lead by memory loss, INSOMNIA followed up with a sleepless Pacino and here he tops it with phobia and fear. And casting Christian Bale as Batman was surely a good move, the former Patrick Bateman looks as his on the edge of breaking all the time, making him intense and pretty scary in his look and atmosphere.We meet down-and-out billionaire Bruce Wayne that's being held in a prison in China. Being a pretty aggressive person he joins the League Of Shadows up in a Himalaya monastery were he's thought totally new skills, but he refuses their methods and returns to his home town Gotham. After his troubled childhood he still suffers from phobia, returning to get rid of the criminality that killed his parents, he dresses in black as Batman and teams up with the only fair people in the city...And Gotham looks better than ever. Not being that peculiar and interesting as Burton's Germanish inspired dark-goth, and not as pathetic and cyber as Schumacher's new wave punk - it looks fashionable but under the surface it suffers from crime and gangsters, violence and cheating. The underworld AND over-world worth remarking, is lead by corrupt cops and laws, mafia bosses that doesn't press charges but shoots you (Tom Wilkinson) and a creepy Scarecrow doing the dirty jobs as a pleasure. In here Batman takes his loop as the dark knight he is and gets allied with off course his best friend, butler Alfred ( played wonderfully by old-English Michael Caine), the policeman (Gary Oldman), Wayne Enterprises R&D man (Morgan Freeman, perfect choice!) and uses his childhood sweetheart (Katie Holmes) just as much as an informant on the law-side as a love interest.And Batman looks better than ever; his dark voice and aggressive attacks leaves old man Keaton and Schumacher's choices as pathetic baby bats. So, flying like a bat and stinging like a bee, Batman's back for business. Filled with great actor performances, amazing action, great CGI, fine dialog and absolutely great settings; Batman Begins is the best Batman movie so far. And one more thing; the Batmobile rocks! Or is it a car or a tanks?\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : I hated \"Daredevil\". I didn\\'t like either \"Spider-Man\". The \"X-Men\" movies were mediocre. I can\\'t say that I remember the \"Superman\" movies fondly. The 1989 \"Batman\" was dull. I hated all the \"Batman\" sequels. \"Catwoman\" was abysmal.In fact, by my definition, a superhero movie usually equates to a moronic, silly and childish piece of crap designed specifically to make tons of money with merchandising and Burger King tie-ins.I hate them. I hate them. I hate them.In fact, I resent the genre for angling the entire medium of film toward a younger demographic. Every major release in this day and age seems to appeal at least somewhat to kids in order to capture the massive dollar amount that they generate. I say... \"Fuck the kids\"! This is an adult world. They can have it later. That\\'s why I almost always appreciate a film that ignores the 13-25 year-old demographic and delivers a literate and intellectual story about adults and for adults.Okay, that rant is over for now...In fact, the only superhero film I even remotely liked was \"The Hulk\". Not surprisingly, it was the one superhero film that didn\\'t do too well with the younger demographic. It was arguably the least financially successful superhero film in the last 20 years. (Not counting the joke that was \"Catwoman\").So, I finally arrive at \"Batman Begins\", a film I presumed would follow the trend of silliness evident in all the other movies of this ilk.I actually liked it?????? What the hell??????With movies like this, so popular and so familiar, I usually dispense with the plot summary. So I will delve right into the opinions...I loved the look of this film. It maintained the slightly somber feel that accompanies the Batman saga, but it wasn\\'t afraid to venture into daylight from time to time. Heck the first third of the film takes place in the snowy mountains of somewhere or another... I wasn\\'t paying attention.My biggest gripe with comic book films is the lunacy of the plots. I usually cannot suspend my disbelief at all. However, \"Batman Begins\" had me from the get -go. I was buying the story... it didn\\'t seem ridiculous to me. SHOCKING!!!Another thing that surprised me was that the villains weren\\'t absolutely ludicrous. Comic book villains are usually so dumb and over-the-top that I lose all sense of belief. Here, they are relatively subdued... I liked that a lot.The only problem I had with the film was the insanely stupid \\'Batman Voice\\' that Bale chose to use. What the hell was that all about? Very silly indeed!The acting was rather impressive all around... Especially from the supporting cast. Only Katie Holmes left me wanting for more. She was rather dull. I liked the turns by Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman... they brought some added weight to the film. Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy were both solid as the bad guys. And apart from Bale\\'s silly voice, he was a very good Batman... his face carries the emotional weight of the character and doesn\\'t let the character venture too far into camp territory.I will say this though... Superhero movies by their very nature are not capable of a grade in the A-range. It would have to be tremendous just to merit a B+ from me. The silliness of a man bouncing around in a spandex suit with pointy ears just will not allow me to go any higher. But \"Batman Begins\" was about as good as I could have imagined from a film in this genre. I teetered between a B and a B+... but because of the pleasant surprise, I am going to reward it with a B+. \"Batman Begins\" is the best in it\\'s genre because it isn\\'t too silly It isn\\'t too campy. It isn\\'t too childish. It doesn\\'t take itself too seriously. It strikes the right balance. It is geared to a slightly older audience than your typical popcorn flick. I had a really good time with this one!\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : To start... I am not a comic book reader and thus will not be making any comment on the history or development of Batman based on the comics. I am purely a fan of the character based off the Tim Burton Films and the old Adam West series that I enjoyed as a child, and the animated series.As the title suggests this is only the beginning. As I am sure Warner Bros. is expecting this to be a hit the movie, it establishes the back-story of the Dark Knight in great detail. I enjoyed the film immensely. If I had to find fault with the movie it would be that I felt the editing was a bit muddled during some of the action sequences, thus making it harder for the viewer to follow the events. I thought the casting was well done and that each of actors talents and personalities fit the character each was portraying.Perfect popcorn eating summer flick.....\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : I wasn't extremely thrilled with Return of the Sith, and so I went to see this film hoping to get a little more for my dollar since the trailer made it look pretty decent. I've got to say, it was pretty slick. Gone is the ridiculous plot and corny humor of the past installments. This movie has a more serious storyline than its predecessors, explaining the origin and training of the Dark Knight to-be and then delivering butt-kicking goodness. High points are the nearly believable explanations of Wayne's acquisition of technology (suit, gear, ride), the edgy cinematography with abrupt, mid-conversation scene changes, and excellent supporting acting by Neeson, Cain, Oldman, and Murphy. I'd say the low points are the rushed nature of Batman's coming of age, but I guess that's understandable given the necessity for Batman vs. Gotham time the already long duration of over 2 hours. And sorry, but I'm not going to say anything nice for Ms. Holmes because I never was a big fan of hers and I'm already sick of the media fiasco over her and Tom Cruise. Anyway, if you want a Batman movie that isn't as over the top as the last ones and is as believable as possible, this is the movie for you. I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being the top critically acclaimed action flick of the year.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : Director Christopher Nolan pulls out all the stops as he embarks on solidifying Batman lore with his retelling of how one Bruce Wayne became the capped crusader Batman. Nolan dazzles in many scenes and is always rock solid, never resorting to cheap humor or unnecessary special effects. This Batman is a dark tale that explains why Batman is the person he is, why he became the person he was to be, and what lies ahead. Christian Bales does a credible job in the lead. He is surrounded by first-rate performers lending their experience and acting savvy: Michael Caine as Alfred(very, very good), Morgan Freeman as Luscious(very, very good), Gary Oldman as policeman Gordon(very good) and villains Liam Neeson(very good), the ever impressive Tom Wilkinson(excellent), and Cillian Murphy(very good). Rutger Hauer is also along as is Katie Holmes(big deal huh?) I really enjoyed this film and was impressed with its cohesiveness and strong script. The script, the direction, the acting, the sets, and the special effects all blend together and make a fine film and probably the definitive Batman film to date. I know many people will compare this to the two Burton films - both good films in their own way. But this Batman is not that Batman. There are no one-liners here and there mixed in with an occasional over-blown scene. This film is a very serious take on a very serious man that has devoted his life to stopping crime in Gotham.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : And so the story begins. Well, according to 'Batman Begins' anyway. This is a very long film, but if offers a detailed account of Bruce Wayne's life, and for the first time in the franchise we really get to know the character. We know where he comes from, what motivates him, and understand why he becomes Batman. Bruce becoming Batman is shown in detail, and I enjoyed that.Despite being fantasy, the clever storytelling makes it feel realistic. I liked the idea that Bruce failed on numerous accounts. This showed that - behind the mask and cape - he was still just human, and not an actual superhero with powers. He is vulnerable, he hurts, he falls, and picks himself up again. None of the other Batman films so effectively illustrated the character as a human being. Bruce overcoming his fear is also well done.'Batman Begins' is visually stunning, with a great production design, and incredible action sequences. As with all the other Batman movies, there are more than one antagonist. The first antagonist is crime lord Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). He is then dethroned by antagonist Crane (Cillian Murphy), who - in my opinion - is the film's main antagonist. Then we also have Ducard (Liam Neeson), and even Earle (Rutger Hauer) turns out to be a villain. Too many antagonists for one film? Surprisingly, here, it works well.Batman must stop Crane, who dumps toxins into Gotham City's water supply, and Ducard, who wants to destroy Gotham City. The result is an action-packed thriller that delivers! The film also features a great score by Hans Zimmer.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : I walked into the Theatre B showing of Batman Begins hoping for an entertaining show to keep me occupied for the evening. What I received was a superb action/thriller with a good deal of depth and fascinating characters. Unlike most previous movies, Batman Begins avoided odd fight scenes in which the Bat armor restricted movement and instead went with stealth and ambush tactics. This technique was true to the batman character and also more exciting than the old fashioned back to back brawling style. The movie's second villain, Scare Crow/Dr. Crane effectively frightened the audience with his intimidating intelligence and freakishly terrifying illusions. Overall, the cast made a commendable performance and Christian Bale's batman surpasses even Keaton's. Cillian Murphy was perfectly casted for his part as the eerily beautiful doctor who dons the horrifying potato sack mask to literally scare his victims into insanity. Also, learning of the Wane legacy for the first time was very interesting. The only part in which the movie lacks is the films evil mastermind character. The mythology behind him was interesting, but his ultimate death sequence lacked the theatrical elements that had become a trademark of the Batman series since the Tim Burton movies.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : Batman Begins isn't another superhero movie in the line of Spider- Man, the X- Men or the Hulk. In fact, even if you don't care for Batman or any of his costumed colleagues, you can still enjoy this film as a good action- thriller. It doesn't thrive on special effects and big action scenes but offers a decent story with lots of attention to character development. The movie is fairly low tech and because it doesn't rely on computer technology in the way other recent superhero movies do, it has an old school feel to it, kind of like an early 80s fantastic film or even Superman: The Movie. Of course, Batman Begins is much darker than Richard Donner's beauty, but the evolution of both main characters from youths, coming to terms with who they are, to caped crusaders is depicted in a similar way. As far as the actual crime fighting goes, this movie puts right everything that was done wrong in Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Our hero's weapons are not covered with blinking lights, but sober and practical: no computer controlled Batarangs, but ninja stars shaped as a bat. No design costume, but military armor, decorated with a cape and mask. The Batmobile is no skyscraper climbing super car, but a rejected army vehicle put to new use that befits the general atmosphere of this movie. Batman doesn't fight villains in shiny outfits who fly around on supersonic gliders or have tentacles as arms. The bad guys in this film are real people: gangsters, a corrupt warden of a psychiatric ward, a martial arts specialist and lots of crooked cops. If you take into consideration that Batman Begins is based on the Year One comics, written by Sin City's Frank Miller, one cannot help noticing the similarity between Robert Rodriguez' newly created world and the one depicted in this movie. In fact, Sin City could just as well be Gotham City without Batman. So forget Joel Schumacher's monstrosities. In fact, Christopher Nolan has even gone one better than Tim Burton and created a credible movie with a good story, realistic characters and the filthiest setting the world's Darkest Knight has ever called home.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : I enjoyed the film BATMAN from Tim Burton, though I'll be the first to admit that it was very, very dark and disturbing. I'd also agree that the Batman role in this and subsequent films was a bit one-dimensional--with a much greater emphasis on the villains and amazing cartoon-like scenes. However, despite enjoying the first film, the subsequent films were a disappointment to me as they just seemed overloaded with special effects and were a bit light on character development.In light of this, I really appreciated how the Batman character was hashed out and given much greater depth in BATMAN BEGINS--especially because it explains the long evolution of Bruce Wayne to caped crusader. Christian Bale was very good in the leading role and the story was very unusual but enjoyable to a point--though the plot did get awfully convoluted towards the end. In fact, I would say that the least interesting part of the film was the final conflict at the end, as this seemed a lot like previous Batman films--full of special effects but that's about all.Now my quibbles with BATMAN BEGINS are quite minor and I can't fault the movie too much because it doesn't pretend to be Shakespeare or a contender for a Sundance award! It is just old fashioned entertainment. Not especially deep, but entertaining.By the way, when I saw this film I was amazed at the high-priced talent organized for this film--Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman. In particular, Freeman and Caine were terrific in the film.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : Now, I'm no Batman expert, but I do know that the tale of him is supposed to be dark and serious. And if I'm correct, this movie certainly succeeded at emulating that feel. Sure, it isn't Star Wars Episode III, and the first Batman movies were certainly more fun (Batman Returns is still my favorite), although this movie probably was the first to accurately translate Batman to the big screen. Living up to my expectations from the trailers, I certainly recommend it to Batman fans.All in all, I give it a B. The movie ain't no Spider-man, but it was certainly no Hulk either (half exciting, half boring as hell). Christian Bale is definitely the Batman.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : At first, when i heard that there is going to be a new Batman film, i thought it would just be another cheap attempt to make some $$$. And so the days past, and i started to be more interested in the story(especially with Chris Nolan as the director). One by one, great actors started to sign on for the film(Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Micheal Cane, Gary Oldmen, Morgan Freeman) and i was all over it. My friends thought it would be really bad and even the great cast and promising trailer didn\\'t really interest them. And then finally i saw the film..... and i was amazed! Chris Nolan has created something other than the Tim Burton Batman we saw in the 80\\'s(and i\\'m not even going to mention Schumacher\\'s \"2 flops in a row\" Batman). He has made Batman the way he is, dark, anti-social and filled with revenge. Batman Forever and Batman & Robin were flops because the films were too much concentrated on the villains. Batman Begins, however, was centered on Bruce Wayne becoming Batman and defeating his fears. This film is truly the best Batman film ever made, and possibly the best film of this year.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : The most well made and mature of all the Batman capers. Probably the first time a comic hero has not been presented like a seemingly inane and kiddish character. Christian is arguably the best \"Batman\" on screen, way ahead of his contemporaries like Michael Keaton or George Clooney. It came as a pleasant surprise to see this six footer enacting the role of this superhero with stupendous control and grace and did not let his fans down in any way whatsoever.Batman has always been a rather mature superhero adored by kids and adults alike and this one time his gray character was brought to the forefront as well.\\n',\n",
       " 'Review of Batman Begins : This movie lot of fun. You should definitely see it if you don\\'t mind canon changes (again, after all, this is DC we\\'re talking about), and/or if you like Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman or Morgan Freeman. All fabulous in this.--spoilers past this point-- I love Gary Oldman. He made this movie worth watching for me. Every time he was on screen, I squeed. And you could tell he was having fun, too. Particularly when he got to use the Batmobile. ;D And they showed his family! I wanna see Babs! (But I\\'m more than willing to wait.) Things that worked: the training sequences, particularly the final training fight between Christian and Liam, which was excellently choreographed. The idea that Wayne Enterprises was being run by a board, because his father was a doctor in canon, so it was a nice nod to why there was a corporation. Where the bat-toys came from! OMG, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. And he was excellent. \"Mister Wayne...Don\\'t think of me as an idiot.\" :D The slow development of Bruce Wayne, depressed and guilty millionaire\\'s son to Batman was just about perfect. Also, Ra\\'s Al Ghul\\'s part in the story was perfect. I had my doubts when I saw that the person playing him wasn\\'t well-known, but trust me...he\\'s PERFECT. Also, I loved that they used Crane/Scarecrow in this very first story. And that for once, the did multiple villains *right*. It ends up setting up everything to come. The final scene with Gordon and Batman on the rooftop (another great line... \"I couldn\\'t find a mob boss\"), and his clue for this Arkham criminal Batman\\'s going to have to capture (no, I won\\'t say which. It\\'s obvious when you see the clue, but it\\'s a biggie.) were excellent. Gives me hope for good movies in the future.The bad: I felt rather beat over the head with the \"Fear\" mallet, specifically at the beginning. And they didn\\'t follow through on it nearly enough. They were obviously having too much fun with the car-chases, blowing things up, and other action scenes. Oh, and I don\\'t hate Katie Holmes, but does she have any other acting style? I swear she was just being Joey from Dawson\\'s Creek. Not what I wanted to see. I would much have preferred to see Talia (Ra\\'s daughter) as a love interest. Seeing as how she really didn\\'t do much for the plot, and their \"romance\" was nonexistent. Michael Cane was nice, but felt mostly unused. I would have liked something more for him to do than snark sweetly at still-evolving Bruce.What I would like from the next one? More thought, less action, more plot. One villain (Joker or Two-face would be nice, but not necessary). And a true love interest...who doesn\\'t find out/figure out who Batman is, or even get taken to his cave, k?\\n',\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : Hit director, Christopher Nolan, brings us another action packed picture filled with special effects. Amazing actors enhance the action within the frames as feelings never felt before are released as you are pulled into the action. All the film needs now is an audience to surround with wonder.The Storyline twists and confuses but also captures and enchants as you follow the life of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and how the tragic death of his parents, affects his opinion on Gotham City. He realises though his experiences how he can make this town a better place. Until his only friend becomes his only enemy, and he feels like the whole world is against him.Gotham City is like no other; with crime ridden streets and dark alleyways, (put there with an intention) it's the perfect setting for Batman's home town. Underground caves surround the grounds of Wayne Towers (Bruce's Fathers business) so secret plans can be laid down to save the city. In these chamber-like rooms with miles a space scientific projects have been stored- never to see the light of day again. Or will they? Michael Cane plays a naturally calm and convincing Alfred. The butler, who serves the Wayne family, adds humour with witty one-liners and a down to earth character, which brings the whole picture into reality. His soft nature is what keeps Bruce from doing what he shouldn't.Christian Bale is extremely talented actor with the skill to comfortably present his character to the audience. Watch his change in character when he is in different situations. This is how the secret of his identity is kept.Heart pacing music creates an astonishing atmosphere to match the high detail and quick moving scenes. Blink and you're bound to miss something! Emotions run riot as you follow with your ears, the intense mood changes and roller coaster story. The clever changes in music tell you what's going to happen before you see it. There is a surprise round every street corner, so be careful you go.Using crystal clear camera tricks and long fast shots, Batman begins is shown in all its glory. Nolan has cleverly followed all the flight, agility and sweeping actions the creature's movement and has captured it on a screen. Quick cuts emphasis the speed of the film and how the story happens in such a small section of history.Overall the techniques used in the film bring it to life and generates a feeling that you are really there, in the one and only Gotham City. Actors' maximise the other features to bring the feature up to and outstanding quality. So much is packed into 134 minutes; every second is worth the attention. You'll be crazy to miss the film of year and probably the film of the decade!\\n\",\n",
       " \"Review of Batman Begins : I would say I did like the movie in general, enjoyed it. What really impressed me thought, was actually the script. I though the script was really well written. Nolan keeps me interested and focused on the movie. Christian Bale was good, but he was too angry and cold, I believe he is a better actor than that. I absolutely loved Morgan Freeman, I think that man never fails.The idea of how justice is subjective, was very intriguing. For some reason I was drawn to the idea of destroying a place that was so overwhelmed with corruption to rebuild it. Even though its too dramatic it felt too real to me as well. It reminded me with Emperor Nero's burning of Rome to rebuild the city.I loved how the movie wasn't just about some action moves, but had many life teaching lessons, especially the first part, before he heads back to Gotham City. The first part of the movie was probably my favorite part. There were lots of good scenes and even more good quotes.I loved that little hint of the joker at the end, though I miss him through out the movie.I was chatting with a friend who said, for some reason he doesn't remember the movie that much, maybe the editing wasn't that good. I think it was OK not very impressive. Visual effects were really good though part of why the movie was quite interesting.Unfortunately Nolan always bore me right before the end of the movie, at some point the action is just taking way too much time and I wan to get to the end of things. Also the soundtracks were good, served the movie well, but didn't feel memorable to me. For me the best one was the movie beginning one, Vespertilio by Hans Zimmer (all soundtracks were of his composition)Overall it is an enjoyable movie, not one of the best I have seen though. Not very sure if it should be on the top250 list.its-lalas-land.blogspot.com\\n\",\n",
