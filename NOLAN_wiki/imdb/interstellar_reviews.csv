Review
"The debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured, if limited, stab at the con game and obsession.  Filmed for zero money, Nolan couldn't have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of London to ply his trade, given the lack of funds.  This short (67 min) is at its best in playing with the audience's and protagonist's expectations about who is scamming whom, though the initial set-up does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept. The muddy cinematography (he often used natural lighting due to budget) can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization, though the limitations do show at times.One can easily see Nolan's style developing in this fledgling effort; many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in MEMENTO and INSOMNIA.  Not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and Nolan fans."
"Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal' way, once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this doozy of a film noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story intertwine), and once with the director's commentary running. Quite amazing. A bare-bones tale, told with more flair, energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today. I think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent Memento, which turned me on to Nolan in the first place. Can't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget (and bigger box-office stars) in his next film, Insomnia."
"Vital and inventive British film about a man who becomes obsessed with randomly picking people out in the street and following themBill becomes obsessed with picking people out in the street at random and following them. He is drawn into the criminal underworld when he chooses to follow a burglar, Cobb, who catches him in the act and encourages him to take things further... This is a rare and inventive British film, one not concerned with being flavour of the month in the style mags. Its low budget is displayed like a badge of pride, which is refreshing rather than annoying. It runs out of steam before the end, but Nolan hints at something very special here."
"I just finished watching Following and I thought it was great. I rated it 8 out of 10. I plan on watching it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order.I rented this movie because of my fascination of Christopher Nolan's more recent movie Memento. Following has some similarities; this movie was probably the blueprint for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar.Shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. The story and dialogue is really good. The performance of the actors is believable.Christopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget. I look forward to his next release Insomnia, a big budget movie with my favourite actor Al Pacino."
"Following 9-29-08Every narrative film needs that hook...that undefinable something that will keep your butt in the seat till the credits roll. Its the one thing any remotely ""good"" film has to do. Following's non-linear structure interestingly enough had me hooked nearly immediately. The film begins with a clean cut looking fella dressed nicely then flashes back and we see the same character now looking rather bohemian....another jump involves our hero lying on the ground having been beaten with a rubber glove shoved in his mouth. These sorts of jumps in the narrative arc of the character occur frequently throughout the film. Begging one to ask how did these future events occur and why? Following's structural approach gives us a narrative that is much greater than the sum of its parts."
"At 70 minutes long, ""Following"" is Christopher Nolan's shortest feature though it certainly isn't his best. But you've got to hand it to him just for coming up with the fantastic story idea. ""Following"" juggles quite a lot of ideas in its runtime of 70 minutes, but somehow the puzzle still remains incomplete by the end of it.A young writer (Jeremy Theobald) follows people around London to find inspiration for the characters for his first novel. He follows specific people and never the same person again, just to see where they go and what they do but decides never to obsess about or get curious as to why they do what they do. Those are the rules he abides by. One day, he decides to follow a clean cut, smart-looking fellow who goes by the name Cobb (Alex Haw). Cobb quickly figures out that he is being followed and confronts the young writer. Cobb introduces himself as a thief, who burgles the houses of people he finds interesting and asks the young writer to accompany him on his burglaries. The young writer becomes infatuated with a young woman (Lucy Russell) whose house he burgles along with Cobb and then things start to go wrong for him.With a budget so low, a film with a story as gutsy as this deserves high praise. To be honest, ""Following"" starts off spectacularly, skimming the streets of London with inspiring cleverness that makes the city look as tempting as it makes it look dangerous, and Nolan slowly builds the tension the narrative requires. The writing in the first few sequences is outstanding, and Nolan delves into the story as soon as the film begins. The two lead characters, the young man and Cobb, are meticulously written so that the viewer gets a useful insight into their minds, what they are thinking. And that's one very important aspect of the film: You need to guess what the characters are thinking even though they don't voice it out loud. And those are pretty much all the positives I have to say about the film.Somewhere in the midst of the second-half, the film cripples. And that's very unfortunate because Nolan's got some great ideas up his sleeve, and he makes a big flaw of letting one on too soon. After that, the film turns into a drama instead of a mystery for the plot continues to unfold in a frustratingly predictable manner. What's left to enjoy is some kind of twist that unfurls in the last sequence, managing a graceful conclusion to a decent feature. But the plot does not attempt to avert what's about to happen and the conclusion does not differ much from the one you might've guessed sometime during the film.Of the performances, Theobald and Haw are convincing. Haw, who plays the cunning Cobb, certainly looks the part and delivers well. The same goes for Theobald. Russell, on the other hand, lacks the urgency that her character was required to throw up in a traumatic situation. Playing the role of a seductress, she comes off as wooden instead of charming, thus remains totally unconvincing in her performance. ""Following"" has wit and diabolical cleverness stashed up somewhere in its stupendously structured plot. It is a film that won't disappoint you, though when the plot concerns a mystery, I expect it to keep me guessing till the very end. Sadly, ""Following"" fails there."
"I saw this movie after I saw Memento.  I was very impressed with Memento so when I saw this at the local video store, I decided to check it out.  I was equally impressed with this little film.  I like black and white films so that was bonus, especially for a noir film.  I thought the acting was very good by actors I have never noticed in other films.  It is short and makes you think, which you can't state about many films.  I loved to guess where a film is going and 90% of the time I know the general outline of the film and where it is going in the first 10 minutes.  Nolan's films are never that easy to decipher at first glance.  I won't spoil the film other than to state the protagonist of the film is not talking to his shrink after he has taken his stalking too far at the beginning of the film as I originally surmised.  This movie is basically a rough draft for some of the ideas and themes Nolan would later explore and exploit in Memento. It works on its own and if Nolan had never done anything afterwards would still be a major talent."
"Christopher Nolan is a sick man.  I say this with all due respect, after witnessing his almost-legendary first feature, ""Following"".  This is not a normal film.  Even if its narrative were presented in strict chronological order it would still not be normal.  Its stark monochrome cinematography, weird music, bizarre performances (which range from the subtle to the wooden, often in the same sentence) and disturbingly warped plot all serve to instill a deep sense of unease in the hapless viewer.  Why do we watch films like this?  Certainly, part of the pleasure comes from seeing characters with whom we can identify and empathise, carrying out acts most of us will never do: burgling, beating, safe-cracking, you know the sort of thing.  Oh, and breaking people's fingers with hammers.  This is not a ""nice"" film.  I would recommend it to anyone, with the warning that they may not enjoy it, but they should definitely see it.  It's seedier than ""Memento"" (Nolan's recent cult classic) and cuts up the narrative for no real reason other than because it can.  This has the mind-bending effect of, for example, showing someone's beaten-up face long before we find out who provided the beating.  Why does Nolan do this?  Because he can.  Because it's cool.  Because it all adds to the menace and unease and perverse pleasure of this strange, strange movie. The follower becomes the followed.  Victim becomes assailant.  Telling the truth lands you in prison.  Lover becomes victim.  Movie audience becomes deeply impressed. Christopher Nolan, you are a sick man, and I applaud you and wait with baited breath for your next excursion into mind-f*ck cinema."
"The best film done by Christopher Nolan. It is totally overlooked by his latest films but if u watch Following u will be stunned by the details that are very carefully put together. The thing that makes this film so extremely great is the dialogues in which nolan has no equal in my humble opinion. It has very dark and melancholic feeling when u are watching the film. Christopher is known for his unusual ways of filming and if u want to see how it looked before he became the brilliant cinematographer, it is his debut film so good eye will spot the mistakes and despite that u will be hooked from the first second :) ! Very underrated and beautiful film."
"Christopher Nolan had his goals set on Following in a very narrow direction, and in that direction he pulled off something that reminded me of the kind of great little 'poverty-row' movies the likes of Ullmer directed back in the 40s. Only this time, he's able to implement touches of homage- things like black and white photography (a given due to the shoe-string budget but also essential to the dark crevices these characters inhabit) and casting of the actors (the John Doe lead, the slick male counterpart, and the beautiful-in-a-gritty way femme fatale)- while keeping it in the realm of the 90s underground indie where for several thousand dollars and specific choices in locations and music and such anything could be possible. That, and as well in the film-noir mood Nolan also puts together a cunning web of a plot, maybe even more so than Memento. Where the latter was a work of a psychology unfolding by way of a plot enriched by looking to the past inch by inch, here the non-linear structure serves the purpose of showing how far someone like Bill can go through as dark a path as Cobb, only in an environment where keeping on your toes is not for someone who's not really twisted and into the deeper mind games Cobb is.Of course, the whole act of following someone becomes the main thrust of the story, and going into it I wasn't even sure where it would lead, if it might be some kind of stream of consciousness ala Slacker where Nolan would lead his character along to one urban British person to another. But the establishment of the ties of Bill to Cobb are done in a quick and excellent way, as we see right when Cobb approaches Bill at the café to ask what he's doing following him tells almost all we need to know about both- that, and the first robbery he brings him along for. What seems to soon be a good score on the horizon is really all one big set-up by Cobb and his lady (just called 'The Blonde', maybe a too-obvious homage to noir, but why carp). But this is revealed in a way that actually truly had me guessing, as the manipulation of the narrative worked all the more to arouse questions not so much of why but of how. The density is brought out all the greater due to the actors understanding of their essential points as characters, with Alex Haw being brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely mask his 'deep' ideas about what it is to really take pleasure in a burglary, and Theobald with that demeanor of someone who can never be as smart as he is in what he really does, but is more intelligent in that naive way that stands no chance in the dank environment such as this; Russell almost makes it too easy, even with a face that would send Ana Savage shaking her head.Meanwhile, Nolan is also on the ball with his style as a cameraman, keeping nothing in that doesn't add to ambiance and suspense, with the fade-in/fade-outs not too quick to leave a lasting impression, but enough to add to the 'this-could-lead-anywhere' logic of the script. He follows it in hand-held form as if he knows where his limitations lie, and yet is fantastic at keeping the essentials: close-ups when need be (one I loved is Russell's face in a small mirror), and a fairly simple techno track that never detracts. Sometimes, as mentioned, the line between seeing something in 'present-day' and seeing something that is as everlasting as a solid pulp story of low-level criminals with mind-games and moral ambiguity is always never totally clear, which for me is practically irresistible in its dark way. Simply put, this is one of the great calling cards I've seen from a filmmaker in recent years, and should hopefully be something that future fans of Nolan's other work can look forward to to discovering. Or even to those who think that noir has gone to the rapid-editing and big-gun-firing dogs of the mainstream (even in independent films) it's a bright little 71 minutes."
"Been a fan of Christopher Nolan's and decided to check out some of his older work. My impression of this film was that it was pretty average and even though it is relatively short, some parts seem to drag on and/or be repetitive. Despite this, the film had an interesting story and was well written, the acting was also quite solid as was the movie as a whole. The ending was also quite good but by now I've come to expect that from Nolan. Several times during the film i caught myself thinking that certain parts were a little cheesy. Not something I would watch again and i do not strongly recommend it but it may be worth your time to see it once."
"As a starting point it's a decent neo-noir flick.
Nolan had to start somewhere and it was quite a unique start indeed."
"Not for me at allI rate it so low because this type of movie is absolutely not geared toward me, I found it boring and I simply wasn't interested, within that, there are some positives that I want to highlight.There are some really good scenes of Dialogue, the apparent 6k budget is beyond impressive to make a movie of this quality. The story is good but not enough for me, seems a bit all over the place it's about a young writer who follows people for inspiration that is found by a thief who takes him under his wing.Yea not for me unfortunately and it's bottom of the Nolan barrel, a good directorial debut to say the least just not my cup of tea, 5/10."
"Christopher Nolan wrote and directed this small, black and white film which came out just two years before his acclaimed ""Memento."" I found it interesting to compare the two, as they both use a non-linear story-telling method. Memento famously started at the end and the film tells the story backwards. ""Following"" isn't quite like that, but uses some of the same editing techniques.For example, after we are introduced to the main characters and the basic premise of the story, we see a scene where the main protagonist looks different, has bruises, is on the ground, and a latex glove is partially out of his mouth. This shot is a jolt because nothing we had seen to that point would lead to that. But then later scenes build up to it an we have our explanation. It is actually a very useful editing technique, it works very well.The man in this story is an aspiring author but in reality an unemployed young man living in a seedy apartment and with lots of time on his hands. He is a curious sort of guy and one day decides to follow someone, chosen relatively randomly, just to see where they go, what they do, just a glimpse into their lives. He sets up his own rules, and one of them is never to follow the same person more than once.But he breaks his own rule and therein generates the drama of the story. He follows a man who sits next to him at a café and calls him on it. The man takes him into his confidence and soon they are robbing residences together, ostensibly for sport.But all is not as it seems and the man eventually gets the very short end of the stick, so to speak. A somewhat interesting movie.SPOILERS: The man he follows and meets weaves an elaborate plan, involving a woman, to set him up, have him steal some money, then have him exposed to the police. He gets blamed for the theft and a murder, and the man he followed disappears."
"A solid and compelling story throughout with its fair share of twists and turns. The acting is passable, however, some scenes were quite amateurish. The characters sufficed, although one of the main character's intentions and motives were left rather unknown. Even though multiple perspectives are given, some only features the protagonist's recollection, thus making the other characters too unknown to find the conclusion fulfilling. Hence, why there might be even more questions unanswered after the movie ends."
"After all the overblown, overlong films I have seen recently thank goodness to find a real gem.  Gritty, twisted and intelligent.  Watch Hollywood grab Christopher Nolan and give him large budgets. Lucy Russell looks just as if she could walk into Philip Marlowe's office and kick start Bogart."
"Proof that a micro-budget is no limitation to the production of a good film - all you need is ideas and verve, a truism that more tyros might heed. Even those elements here that might be considered flawed by 'budgetary limitations' - the sometimes uncertain camerawork, the limited locations, the lack of extras etc. - on the contrary add to this thriller, give it a dream feel where the lead character has no control over his actions, keeps returning to the same places, trapped in someone  design, both literally, in space, and in terms of fiendishly conceived plot.Heavily influenced by THE USUAL SUSPECTS, the first signal of breach is the voiceover, which begins with the usual, voice-of-god, this-is-what-really-happened, honest-guv authority, but is broken by a second voice, which questions it, undermines it.  Already, the lead character's voice is undermined, and, as everything we see proceeds from his voice, so is the narrative.  The plot therefore works on three levels - on the level of the story as the Young Man tells it; on the more Proustian level, where chronological order is not observed, like you would tell a story to friend, leaping all over the shop; the 'real' level, where the master puppeteer finally reveals his strings.Before the thriller proper starts, there is a welcome prologue that places FOLLOWING in a different mode altogether, , one more indebted to Hitchcock, Powell, Poe, Benjamin, Baudelaire, Marker, Keiller.  The Young Man, ostensibly a writer gathering material, or 'between jobs' as Cobb notes with cruel accuracy, takes to following random people, not for sexual kicks, just to see what they do, where they live.  This opens up a fascinating series of questions about alienation, voyeurism, urban solitude, decentring, the attempt to connect.  The invading of people's lives, the assuming of identities, all of which are ingeniously put into practice in the crime narrative.  There is a Benjaminian concern with dead urban spaces, those places, apartments, abandoned restaurants etc., that dot London (and presumably other large cities), uninhabited , transitory stopovers for flaneurs, malevolent ghosts.Because in one way this is a ghost story, about people inhabiting other people's spaces, identities, minds, leaving unfathomable marks, traces. There is an obsession with objects, trinkets, rememberances, as if all this will somehow make substantial the transitory.  This extends to the Young Man, who inhabits a plot that doesn't exist, and absorbs traces of Cobb, his personality, his look, even his girlfriend, until he literally ceases to be himself, an empty receptacle waiting to be used, someone outside society about to be hung for someone else's traces.One shouldn't forget that the film is brilliantly plotted as a thriller, and the chronological leaps are hilarious (in that what 'follows' clears up what went before, though technically after, not always as we'd expect, but also undermining characters' sense of agency, and creating a sense of menace, of not being grounded, not being in control that extends to the audience as well as the Young Man.  The idea of a master 'author' writing the fiction, juggling his unwitting characters, brings to mind Welles, and there is the extraordinary central set-piece, blackly comic, where the Young Man goes to get the photographs; this is troublingly Wellesian, as he enters a realm with objects which seem to dissolve before him into an engulfing heart of darkness.  In one way, the film is an anti-detective film, full of clues, 'following' and incidents to interpret, but rather than solving the crime or conspiracy, the detective becomes fatally enmeshed.As I suggested, the film is liberated, rather than constrained, by budget. So if it has flaws, than they are a result of conception.  The first isn't really serious - the likeable actors become increasingly monotonous - when characters who aren't really expressive, but try to be, it can get a bit tiresome - surely Bressonian passivity is more appropriate.  There is perhaps a misogyny in the character of the Blonde, in keeping with the old film noir triangle structure, although the deliberate framing and lighting of her as a 40s siren with an arch London accent suggests parody.  More serious is the resolution, which ultimately backs away from the ambiguity of THE USUAL SUSPECTS, providing a clear-cut, if clever, denouement, having worked so hard at enigma.  Never mind, this is still a remarkable debut, showing there's life in the old genre yet."
"Christopher Nolan is a film director whose talent was so quickly recognised that his second feature Memento was given a budget of four-and-a-half million dollars. His debut, 1998's Following is a different matter: made on a shoe-strung budget and shot on 16 mm black-and-white film, and starred a cast of non-professional actors who had to film around their day jobs. The fact that it is, in spite of this, remarkably impressive, makes it easy to understand why Nolan subsequently had no difficulty getting funds thrown at him.The plot of Following concerns a man credited simply as The Young Man who follows strangers around London in order to provide inspiration for a novel he intends to write. One day he follows professional burglar Cobb, who spots him, takes him under his wing and teaches him how to break into and burgle houses. As The Young Man becomes ever more embroiled in his newfound criminal lifestyle, he soon finds himself increasingly out of his depth as he is drawn into the orbit of gangers The Bald Man and the Bald Man's ex-girlfriend, The Blonde.In many ways, Following feels like a dry run for Memento, with a non-linear narrative, an unreliable narrator, and several twists. It's both dark and witty: Nolan also wrote the screenplay and as well as boasting a complex plot, it also benefits from impressive characterisation, with every character proving believable despite their lack of real names; for example Cobb, an eloquent burglar who can deduce a vast amount about his victims from their belongings, is fascinating character and his philosophical approach to his chosen ""profession"" is brilliantly, blackly comic. The framing sequence sees The Young Man recounting how he came to be in his current position to a Policeman; even as his tale unfolds, additional material is expertly woven into the narrative making it eventually apparent that he is sadly deluded about the truth of his situation until it is far, far too late.Nolan's flair for direction is immediately obvious. The grainy 16 mm monochrome film stock might have been a budgetary choice, but it significantly contributes to the film noir aesthetic that inspired the director, with the result that a film made on the cheap never actually looks cheap. Every shot is perfectly framed and perfectly lit. Nolan also edited the film, expertly assembling individual scenes jigsaw-like into a picture that only becomes clear at the end. The finishing touch is a simple but effective soundtrack from David Julyan, who would reap the rewards of his association with Nolan by scoring his next few - increasingly big budget - films and thus launch his own career.With the exception of Nolan's uncle John Nolan, who plays the Policeman to whom The Young Man tells his story, there are no professional actors in Following, although Lucy Russell (The Blonde) subsequently became one. Nevertheless, Nolan coaxes convincing and naturalistic performances out of all of them, especially Jeremy Theobald as the film's protagonist and Alex Haw as the charismatic and ultimately ruthless Cobb.Debut films of well-known and critically acclaimed film directors are sometimes mere curiosities, and sometimes demonstrate early promise but don't live up to later works: watching Following, it is apparent that Nolan's only limitation at this early point in his career was money and even with very little he managed to deliver a movie that is more interesting, more intelligent and more stylish than many Hollywood blockbusters."
"A noir-esque tale with abrupt leaps in chronology. In other words, a warm-up for MEMENTO. The later film succeeds both because of and despite its gimmick. The earlier film (Nolan's first feature) ultimately feels nothing but gimmick. The theme of invading other people's lives is shrugged off after a few weak Tyler Durden-isms and never explored in depth. The performances are mediocre. The photography and other technical aspects show promise, but it's not especially impressive craftsmanship. It all just seems to revolve around the cleverness of the script, and I found the gotcha twists a bit tedious. Not bad as a first effort, but not a very fulfilling or even entertaining experience."
"Inception, The Dark Knight, The Prestige, Batman Begins, Insomnia, Memento, these are the list of Christopher Nolan directing movies, and ""following"" is the debut and logical as a debut, but absolutely not even close to the other of his great career! This film presents some really interesting ideas and interesting story, but I didn't find it to be particularly well-ended. It was black and white, it was short and low budget, but from the middle of this movie I felt it is going to shakeup! and it did. The acting doesn't match the audacity of the script. The script doesn't stand up in a court of logic. The promise fails to fulfill the idea."
"FOLLOWING is Director Christopher Nolan's brilliant, extremely low-budget film. It's filmed in black and white in a stark, noir style. The characters are mysterious and the plot is downright diabolical.The idea of following total strangers around is creepy and potentially hazardous. Nolan uses this to draw us into the character's world, as well as his rather uncomfortable habit of shadowing people. We're a part of what he does, and we become fascinated, even while being made to squirm a bit. What happens to the main character is fitting and astonishing. The twists and turns are exhilarating.If you like puzzles with bite, then you'll probably love this..."
"The very first full-length movie from Nolan already contains many of the director's trademarks: a heavy timeline-based edition, somewhat intriguing plot and a few (maybe more than necessary) twists.In this case, the B&W filming gives a noir mood, and helped to hide the bad acting in many moments. I recommend watching it if you want to know a early Nolan in all his essence, and to notice how some signature moves could turn a director in a cliche of himself."
"Even with only 6,000 bucks and a cast of part-time actors, Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is in my opinion, the next great and our first taste of Nolan doesn't contradict that.None of the problems that constantly plaque and discredit the low budget independent picture haunt Nolan and crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver and engage us in this story. In all honesty I think Following is Nolan's best screenplay because it is the one he had the most control over. It's a beautifully imagined film. It takes us into a world where we don't feel limited by the constraints of budget. The dialogue and atmosphere is bold and intelligent.Nolan's trademark method of telling the story out of continuity is applied for the first time here and here it is done in a way that throws the story full out at you. With Memento and The Prestige you have to think a bit to truly get a complete grasp on the genius but Nolan doesn't try to confuse people with his prototype film. We can distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist. This method of telling a story is both creative and engaging. I am Glad that Nolan has had so much success with it because his films become more than what they could be with this method. The pay offs in the Prestige and Memento would not have been thrilling at all if the movie was told in a conventional format. This idea has been done with moderate success before but Nolan has truly made it his own.The script here is Nolan's finest. I had some doubts about his writing abilities, I all ways imagined that his brother Jonathon was the writing talent but he proves me wrong with Following. It is a thought provoking story which makes interesting observations of people and how they function. Cobb's assessments about burglarizing and how it can lead you to discover what makes people tick actually sounds plausible.My only real complaint is the camera work gets shaky at times but it doesn't take away anything from the story or the acting.Following is the first film of the man who will personify 21st century film-making at it's finest."
"Following was a nicely paced, sparse movie.  There weren't any superfluous scenes.  It told an engaging story with a minimum of fuss.  I enjoyed it. If you want to watch a good film-noirish type movie you can't go wrong with this one.  Well worth the time."
"Christopher Nolan's micro-budget feature debut is a taught noir thriller that wisely relies on an excellent screenplay rather than expensive spectacle and, as such, proves that you don't need a budget to tell a good story. 'Following (1998)' really is phenomenal considering the money, and schedule, it was made on. It is a suspenseful and engaging tale that shows all the signs of what a great director Nolan would go on to become. A fantastic debut and a better film than many a director's second, third even fifteenth outing. 7/10"
"I`m in two minds about FOLLOWING , the film debut of Christopher Nolan . Part of me admires it for costing 6,000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house . In many ways it reminds me of the cult movie PI , a film I disliked , and I can`t get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around . Wouldn`t it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? Oh well I guess FOLLOWING gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing $6,000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it , but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn`t made by the director of MEMENTO ?"
"Spoilers herein.`Memento' struck me as intelligent and clever.It folded time in a way that supported the narrative self-reference. The device of the text on skin spoke to the vigorous selfexamination of what it means to act. Seeing this predecessor disappoints, as does reading the comments that think these films are in any way similar.Oh, this has some time shuffling. But it has nothing whatever to do with the story, which is a relatively standard triplecross surprise. Here, it is an aid to the storytelling. But `Memento' spoke to deep issues of narrative and representation: the story was a throwaway -- just an excuse."
"I have to say for a directorial debut this film is very good. The plot is good, acting is good for a low budget film, writing is great, the plot comes together better than Tenet his most recent film. Overall a quite good film.Considering it's his first film, it's 10x than pretty much every other directors debut. It is a genuinely good film, and it's a film I'd recommend to anyone to show how to make a really good film on an extremely low budget. It's so interesting about how the budget of this film is £6,000, but doesn't feel like it. Nolan is a master director and writer.9/10"
"It is Christopher Nolan's first feature film (budget around £3,000 and shot it on weekends), depicting an unemployed young writer who trails strangers through London in order to get inspiration for his first novel, but ends up being drawn into criminal activities and suspicious acquaintances... All main characters (nicely played by still little known British actors) are odd and enigmatic, with inclination to reasoning and justifications. The scenes run smoothly, although it is difficult to follow-up at times and some characters provide no value to the course of events. Mystics is stressed by black-and-white frames and lack of light, but ending scenes give viewers sophisticated explanation how and why all this web was woven... The 80 minutes pass in a catchy manner and if you like Nolan's later mind-twisting works (e.g. Memento and Insomnia), you will like this as well."
"An excellent debut movie for the the director of Batman Begins, comes the Following, a movie about a man who follows other people for inspiration of characters in stories he writes. One man he follows, he decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he bargained for.Using a cast of non-actors and his uncle, writing directing producing and otherwise completely making this movie entirely on his own with almost no budget and produced independently, this movie is much more than you'd expect.For anyone who likes Memento and complex twists, turns, shocks, and messing around with time, this is definitely a movie for you."
Asusal nolan rocks...i had watched only one time soo i dont deserve to rating or review this movie...miles to go away to review this movie...
"Exciting thriller based on film noire with which Christopher Nolan makes his debut. In some thriller elements a bit too exaggerated and the character drawings are repeated in some places, but a good film that was properly implemented with limited resources.7,0"
"One can see the idea developing, but it isn't fully fleshed out in this film.  The play with time, the memory and identity confusions, the manipulations -- they are all very interesting in their own rights, but don't meld into a watchable movie in this case.  The story drags, and in scene after scene I found myself thinking, ""I get the point, so what happens next?"" See Memento, rather."
"Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is a memorable one. The film was very well received and help land contracts for making 'Memento' and quite rightfully so. Following is an exquisite example of how films should be made. No fancy effects or blood-dripping gore...just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writing. The actors, all unknowns to me and I suppose most people, did a good job bringing the characters to live. They were all believable and that's all they need to be. The film is confusing because it plays with chronology a lot but it's very rewarding in the end. The film's a little short to be a full-length feature but any additional length would've ruined the style of the movie and the brilliance of the writing would've been diminished. Though short, the film has every aspect that makes a film attractive (IMO): an intriguing beginning, an exciting middle and a surprising end. I dare say Following is almost as good as Memento, his best film by far. The scrambled chronology is equally masterful used in both films, the amazing plot twists are present and the acting is very good.This film was made with a mere $6000 but the quality is much higher than most( almost all) million dollar box-office hits. The use of b&w may be a hard pill to swallow for the big audience, following is primarily Nolan showing off his skills to the studio bosses :-). And what skills they are...rarely have I enjoyed writing so much as in 'Following'. Even Pi doesn't even come close IMO, though it's also very good.This is a film surely not to be missed by any self-respecting movie-lover. If you liked Memento, 'Following' is definitely for you."
Too bad this 70 min. film didn't see a very broad release--too short for the standard commercial outlets.  It has an entertaining twisty script and fine performances from a cast I was not familiar with.  Very well done black & white cinematography.  I especially enjoyed the musing on what our most trivial possessions say about us to strangers.
"The plot was written such that the movie could have several reveals, and some scenes appear out of order chronologically. I guess the viewer is supposed to think ""aha! so that's what was going on!"" several times as the movie progresses, and feel clever and satisfied each time, but I found it to be tedious.Also, just because a plot is difficult to figure out doesn't mean that it's smart or good. If the story were instead told from Cobb's point of view, and in chronological order, it would seem very silly indeed.Otherwise I liked everything about the movie--the setting, the characters, the acting, the dialogue, the individual situations, etc. If the movie had a plot that was interesting and believable and told it without gimmicks, I would definitely rate it 10/10."
"With (very) low budget, good direction and an ambitious and sophisticated script, Nolan's first film is also one of his best works."
"As a young aspiring filmmaker that has no idea where/how to start making films, this movie showed me that money is not an issue. You should use what is within your reach and make it happen. If you don't have money, skill or time to get insane color grading, huge dolly shots or high-end professional lighting equipment just record on black and white, hand-held, take advantage of the natural daylight and don't do a 3 hours long film. This feature film directed by Christopher Nolan, the man behind some of the biggest movies in the current generation and nominated for multiple Oscars, was made with a 6,000$ budget! If you pay close attention to the movie you can see that but when you do you are already into an intriguing story, a mysterious thriller about a young man who follows strangers and meets a burglar that doesn't steal for the money."
"To think this was his first feature length film and was filmed on $6,000 is incredible.Is it an amazing film? No but it is very good.The thing that makes him stand out as a director is evident in this as he makes not great actors, no effects, black and white dingey scenes hook you in and make you nervous and fully invested.The amazing aspect of the film is the story. It is so clever when explained at the end and is an early glimpse of his brilliance that we now know.If I could give 7.5/10 I would but that is when taking into account inexperience and budget which I think is fair as it can't compete with blockbusters."
"Following, Christopher Nolan's early foray into filmmaking, is a gritty and experimental noir that showcases the director's raw talent and potential. While its strength lies in its minimalist approach and intriguing narrative structure, it can be a divisive viewing experience. The low-budget cinematography adds an authentic and voyeuristic quality, and the performances, particularly by Jeremy Theobald, demonstrate promise. However, its non-linear storytelling, while a hallmark of Nolan's style, might feel confusing or disconnected to some viewers. The lack of a more substantial budget is evident in the production quality, and the absence of a compelling musical score can make it a somewhat forgettable experience. Hence, a 6/10 rating seems apt, as Following marks an interesting starting point in Nolan's career but lacks the polish and depth of his later works."
"Definitly a Christopher Nolan work you should not skip.After I saw this film, it was still warm inside my brain, I was about to press play on the next when I noticed that this one was still resonating in me. How it planted the necessary ideias to guide us to think and perceive exactly what is expected, just like what happens to the main character.I was still gathering my ideias after I finished it when I realized that this could be a story about a story. Which is the thing I like the most about this film.I recommend it for those who, such as myself, like to gather pieces along the film and watch them come together, but still be puzzled about how it turned out."
"We can see influence of Call M for murder.In part of that movie guy follows other , to see his routine and to blackmail him to kill his wife .In this movie writer follows people for inspiration. We can see also influence of diffrent timelines like in Resoirvoir dogs , even we can see RD poster on the wall .Strong debut for litlle money .7 from 10 from me"
"First, I thought it was just a movie about one following someone and digging deep. But it couldn't BE more better. The director of the film speaks for himself - Christopher Nolan"
"One the Lowest Nolan movies but ... but a good and respectable movie with very few budget
Totally worth watching."
"Instead of risking my neck to catch coronavirus along with Nolan's latest film, why not see his widely praised debut at home? So here a few things i have to note.1) It's pretentious. Both the hero and the hitman have some interesting philosophies motivating their actions but the film soon dumps these ideas revealing its conventional and hollow plot.2) It's unnecessarily convoluted, the 31 (according to trivia) changes of timeline could just as well have been served by a couple of flashbacks at the final act to deliver the twists and fill the plot holes.3) It isn't suspenseful. The first timeline is about the hero turning into a fanboy almost at first sight and then the low-stake scenes repeat themselves. The second is the hero getting a girlfriend which also is suspense-free until very late in the film when she reveals what she really wants of him to do while the last timeline is him preparing for the safe heist. That would have been thrilling if the non-linear mess had presented the stakes behind the heist, only it doesn't but after it happens so we get a random heist.4) It doesn't make much sense. Is the hitman planning to frame the hero for a burglary gone wrong or for a date ending in homicide? If it's the burglary, why instruct the woman to date him? Planting the evidence at the crime scene is more than enough. If it's the date option, the police always has the date/husband on top of their suspect list. The things stolen from her house are not needed to be found at the hero's place for the authorities to be convinced about the hero-victim connection.5) The hitman's plan is one of the dumbest in movie history. He is the first paid killer to date his victim by plan, leaving witnesses and DNA everywhere to connect him with her if anything goes wrong. He also befriends the guy to be framed so another set of witnesses like the couple that saw them robbing their apartment, can testify of them being accomplices in crime6) I wonder, if the hero didn't do the incredibly stupid thing of surrendering to the police would they have found him? He's a very meek guy with almost certainly no criminal record, so nothing for the cops to compare the evidence at the crime scene with. That means the hitman's plan hinges on the hero being as dumb as humanly possible, surrendering willfully to the police and confessing. Not a great plan.7) Let's suppose that the hero after declaring his intentions to the woman about confessing and surrendering to the cops, does the obvious, sensible thing, gets a cab and heads to the police station. That sounds like a bulletproof alibi as the time of death would prove. Again, not a great plan by the hitman8) Why the hitman beat up the hero? No, Nolan wanting the bruises on the hero to differentiate the second from the third timeline doesn't qualify as an answer.9) The way the victim was murdered is identical to how the mobster that hired the hitman, is killing his victims. That would lead the police straight to him as this is his signature killing since he could have just as well have hired the fall guy. Again, it doesn't sound like an intelligent plan.So overall an unnecessarily convoluted, poorly constructed, pretentious and dumb film that if it wasn't for Nolan people would have easily pointed at its shortcomings."
"Nolan shows his writing and directing skills with his first mindbending, shocking and unpredictable film."
"Initially I was annoyed that the movie was shot in arty, grainy B&W. But the script and storyline is very clever. And for a first movie from someone who hadn't studied at film school, and presumably just had their friends as actors, if the $6,000 budget is to be believed, the direction and acting are superb, maybe better than some of his blockbusters."
"This movie had me at ""may I join you?"". But it lost me 3/4 of the way through. I may not have predicted exactly how it ends. But half way through if I had three guesses one of them would have been right. It starts with a few great character portraits. But it degenerates into a Hitchcock wannabe. I don't object to the portrayal of events, but the buildup to the ""surprise"" ending made the end not worth watching. I think I'll skip Momento. Your comment does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text. Your comment does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text."
"""Following"" tells of a struggling writer who shadows people as research for his work and in the process falls in with a burglar and finds himself inextricably embroiled in a scheme which could lead to his own end. A Brit flick in black and white, this austere production lacks the usual Hollywoodish tinsel but makes up for the deficit with a solid story line which will keep you guessing to the end....and, unfortunately, beyond.  Good stuff for those into UK indie films where the focus is more on intricately woven story complexities than budget and baubles. (B-)Note - The DVD I watched, which came from Netflix.com, had an annoying icon in the corner, would jump a scene at a time in fast forward and fast reverse, and pixelated periodically. However, it did have extra features including script pages sync'd with the dialogue."
"This movie is first long movie of Christopher Nolan and if you watch by know this, you love this movie. Just a different experience and i love different things."
"An interesting showcase for a lot of the ideas and themes that would permeate a lot of Nolan's later films, but this low budget affair reeks of ""first film,"" right down to the casting of people who don't actually appear to be actors at all and are likely just friends of the director/investors. This does all work to make Theobald's performance stand out, though.The plot is a mite unrealistic and convoluted but keeps you hooked throughout with some great twists and turns.An interesting but imperfect effort. A lot of the ideas on screen would see much better realisation in the later Memento."
Nolan wanted to deliver a message through this work and she is not an idiot.
"Nolan does it again; he continues to play with my head and I'm loving it. While Following is not as confusing as Momento, it is just as intriguing. Adding to its mystery is the fact that it was shot in black and white. Nolan tells a clever story with concise brevity; how refreshing in a time when most movies are WAY too long. The acting and production is superb.  I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys being mentally engaged."
"Following (1998) is an intense and memorable start to Christopher Nolan's career. The Film is not only visually impressive showcasing the early signs of Nolan's Signature style, but the story is what really sticks out. An intense crime drama portrayed as a puzzle jumping between past, present, and future while juggling a diverse and nuanced cast of characters turn this budget project into an authentic experience. While the film does lack some polish, especially concerning the soundtrack and what will become an entire career of sometimes hard-to-hear dialogue, these flaws don't take away too much from the movie overall. Following is a film about a unique idea that oozes Nolan's style and passion in a refreshing and extremely well-done manner. It should not be overlooked by its age and at the time, amateur director, as the film excels with what it has to offer. Overall, Amazing!"
"Great film for how like to know everything about every buddy, it's just like me .. .... ... . ..... ....... .... .. .... ... ): ..... ........ ..... .... .... . ... ... . . . . ."
"#Following
Fascinating thriller with a low budget.Great movie by Chris_Nolann a classic thriller which confuses you a bit. Poor production & disappointed with actings of star cast."
"Nolan again ... what is agreat movie . In the beginning i like to much , i like the main character . How can he follow people, this idea is strange . And lead to alot of secrets . This movie is short and the story usually demand time like this . Movie is considered new but is taken by white and black camera. There are just three main characters and the movie is only around them . Movie will manipulate your thoughts, so don't judge early just see and wait . Movie did not contain any bad content. City is strange and i can't know it . After this movie i like to go for the past to see the old movies and enjoy by that time."
"It's easy to see, in his first production, exactly why Christopher Nolan is one of the best modern directors. Like with what we would eventually see in Memento, this is an out-of-order complex confusing psychological thriller with plot twists galore. Stylized in black-and-white and stripped of 90's technology, it could pass for an old school noir-film.While not as intricate and lavish as his later films, Nolan does a tremendous amount of good with practically no budget and a cast of competent actors. The fact the cast plays their roles like regular people instead of the Hollywood cliché acting we'd expect from a drama is sort of refreshing. At 70 minutes, it's short but definitely not short-changed."
"It makes the spectator curious and it kind of stupefies, but it's not more than a puckish and unconventional piece that has a very unlikely plot full of holes."
"What an incredible debut from Mr. Christopher Nolan with this taut and intelligent noirish thriller. At a swift 70 minutes, he is able to deftly establish an atmosphere and interesting characters while showcasing some of the themes that would later go on to categorize his films i.e. obsession, identity and deception. The dialogue is also super insightful offering us glimpses into the human condition while being reminiscent of older noir films and, of course, twists and turns that Nolan would become known for. A film that necessitates a viewing from any Nolan fan, film-noir fan or fan of films for that matter! 👏"
"Although I didn't love this film, I can truly appreciate seeing the early signs of Nolan's genius at work here. He had a distinct style from the very beginning and I believe that this movie would've had greater potential with a bigger budget and some more experienced actors. Overall, it had many pieces that were interesting in their own rights, but none of it really meshed that well for me. I can understand why others may love this movie, even though it dragged for me regardless of its short runtime. Nolan's love of great scores and twists are in full effect here as well. And the most exciting part of this film for me was seeing a Batman logo on a door! An incredible foreshadowing of what greatness is to come from Nolan."
This film was so damm creepy. I love the 4:3 ratio and the blacks and white look. It has the vibe of a 40s film noir. Christopher Nolan first film is proof that you don't need heavy VFX and explosions to tell an interesting story. You just need to have a good story and execution.
"It is the first film of one the best young directors around Christopher Nolan. The Following is a must see if you are a fan of suspense films. The story is fanatically intense. The ending takes all the gaping strands and pulls them together in a way that may really surprise you. You don't know what to expect from the end. That makes all the Nolan' films that great. It's clearly seen that man's mind is powerful. Capable of doing some great things as future as shown.This movie is black and white. There are no well-known actors. It lasts only 70 minutes. Nevertheless, it is well worth watching if you want have a good one-hour entertainment."
"I was surprised to see this movie was directed by christopher nolan. Being one of his first movies this does really show his creativtiy. And its for the creativity that it gets a six. Sure its a bit of a shame that this movie is as short as it is, but it works and everything is told that needs to be in the short time we get. It sets up this author,played by jeremy theobald and he has no names. He likes following people for his characters and seems a bit of psycho. Until one day he meets a man named cobb that breaks in peoples houses but is not really interested in stealing things. It all leads to jeremy going down this path which he might not get back from. Black and white was an interesting choice but it worked here. Even with a low budget christopher created something that can be looked back on by othetr budding directors and they can understand little things here and there that can make a film great."
So i was mostly interested by the movie because it was the first movie of Christopher Nolan as a director and i need to say that i really enjoyed it. It dont have big special efrects or CGI like his recent movies; it have some simple shots with few locations and few characters and worked arround during the whole movie. And to be honest i really enjoyed it. Its simple and let the story reveal the complexity and the depth of it. This man who follow another man who is in fact a burglar who just wanted to use the perfect stranger to cover his track and make him accused of a crime that he is suspected. It was pretty surprising to see also the revelations about the blond girl who revealed to be an associate to Cobb and was just make Bill a fool and play with him to get out Cobb of suspicions. It was pretty clever writing and i didnt see things coming; it was pretty unexpected. I enjoyed it and find interesting mostly by the writing and the characters. It have some qualities. The surprises and revelations are there and find the movie pretty good even its pretty simple. I enjoyed it.
"Following is Nolan's first film, and undoubtedly is one of the director's most unknown masterpiece that did great works such as The Prestige, Memento, Inception, Intertellar and the highly acclaimed Batman trilogy, Following is the weakest of the Nolan has a low budget, but the film is not bad, we see some features of Nolan face, the plot tries to be confused at times, the cast is very competent, the photography is good, the script Is good, the pace is competent, even more that the film is very short, the direction of Nolan is good, even more with limitations, Following is an competent film, is the beginning of a director of an enviable curriculum. Note 6.5"
"This was a lot of fun to watch. To see Christopher Nolan's evolution in film is highly enjoyable. Following being a under budget film and his first film at that, still manages to have all the good things that make a Christopher Nolan film (Besides the special effects, score and sound mixing). The acting was solid for an under budget film. Which shocked me at that. The writing was actually really well done. One could argue it's one of his most thoughtful written films. It is very different from his other films and it was fun to see. Overall, while struggling with a small budget. Following still manages to hold your attention with its writing, pacing and scene jumping."
"Well written, great twist in the end but Nolan knew that wasn't enough. His love for time is also here. That hair cut surprised me and I had to return again to connect the dots...Nolan just improves himself, more complex story in future. The only flaws for me would be the restrictions a 6000 dollar movie would have.Performance were great, specially Cobb. His delivery and charm was beautiful. 2 multiple twist came back to back which might be hard to indulge.Ending reminded me of 'Dial M for Murder' where protagonist traps a guy completely from every direction, the perfect murder."
"Although Nolan, the filmmaker, was in his infancy when this was being created, I could still notice the sparks of his writing calibre, the mastery underneath that peeked through in some instances.He always had it in him; he knew and understood the craft of storytelling from the very beginning, and this being his debut feature speaks a lot in itself.It may not be anything special, but considering it was his first venture into the terrain of cinema, It's indeed an engaging thriller with all the twists and turns you would typically expect, and the use of monochrome only adds to the overall experience!"
"I was already aware that this was Nolan's 'least-best' film, but not that it would be so screwy. I compare this to Kubrick's first film, Fear and Desire (1953), as both are so amateurish and terrible works that it looks like prototype feature films for what Kubrick and Nolan would be after. Of course, Following is much better than Fear and Desire, but it's still a little scary.The story of the feature is a bag, difficult to follow, with superficial and uninteresting characters. La Haine (1995) without the ending is the same as Following. Why black and white photography? The direction is poorly done, the shots are pretty ugly, the acting is really bad and the twist is stupid. The film also abuses too much of the unnecessary scenes too much, the film could quietly last less, the storytelling here is absolutely horrible crap, not even to entertain this film works."
"This topic should have pleased a director like Alan Pakula, a kind of chess game between two characters, as SLEUTH was in sme way. This early Christopher Nolan's job is promising and can also be seen as a some tribute to old film noirs from Hollywood forties B pictures, starring Lloyd Nolan or Warner Baxter. This is a must see but, I repeat, a bit hard to follow for an idiot like me. But the bulk of the audiences are fortunately not like me...Concerning Chris Nolan's next picture: MEMENTO, useless to say I quit long before the end...."
"Obviously not very solid debut, but the b/w (mostly hand held) cinematography is good enough to complement the acting.  Not that the actors are bad, but the film can't build on their performance and it's not always clear where Nolan wants to go.  I like to see it as a twisted plot, not as twisted as Memento, but still.  Fortunately he concentrates on the style in Memento with success.Following is a contemporary film-noir and feels like a mockumentary sometimes, but has a lot of potential (easy to say that after the success of Memento, isn't it?), especially as a psycho-thriller.  As in Memento, the most interesting thing about the movie is the structure of the story and the unraveling of the information.  Slightly reminiscent of Suture (McGehee/Siegel, 1993).  Concluding: Nolan has more potential and subtlety than Hitchcock (IMHO :-).8/10"
"This film really surprised me. I'm not Nolan's fanboy, but this film was great and it was his very first. It was very cheap, but it's understandable since it's his first film. What he made is amazing. The story is great, full of twists and great writting. This film was pure joy to watch."
The one that already plays with timelines. Good to see where it all started.
"Why is this story told backwards and what's the chronological version like? Is there a way to find it online? Also, is the burglar's name really Cobb or the name on the credit card that the young man forged? The old man at the end states there's no listing of Cobb and that the house being robbed was Danny's (the name on the credit card). Yet, in the beginning, we see the two rob Cobb's house without the young man knowing that it's his. It would make sense since Cobb never had a last name and police don't know what he looks like anyway."
"I love this film. Just calm, simple, strong filmmaking.Truth is that not many directors can make such a good movie with such a small budget. The story is original. The deeper you go in the movie, the more you start to recognize Nolans' signature. And while it may not be that spectacular, it is engaging and if you invest in it, you'll win. It surely captures the spirit of a less noisy, silent noir-film, than the great set-pieces of blockbusters. It's a confident and self-realized script executed really well.I guess that finding and watching this movie alone is a proof that you are probably a Nolan fan, so I trust that you'll enjoy it. But the man who is behind this picture is today one of the finest directors and screenwriters, so even if you are not a fan of these types of films, you have a reason to give it a shot."
"I just saw ""Following."" It was the first movie that Christopher Nolan (director of Memento) did. It's a black and white British film noir. Only 69 minutes, but VERY good. If you like movies with twists, this is it, folks. Similar to Momento, but not the same. It tells its story out of chronological sequence. It, however, does not tell it backward like Momento. It skips around, flashing forward then falling back. It takes a wee bit to get used to, but it well worth it.If you're a David Mamet fan, by the end of the movie, you just may just be reminded of one of his films -- ""The Spanish Prisoner.""Trust me, go out and rent this!Oh yes, if you rent the DVD as opposed to the video, a special feature allows you to watch the movie chronologically."
"I liked the fact that it was in black and white and loved the interesting characters in this film. A good cast. I found it entertaining from the start, something that I often struggle with. It kept me engaged all the way through. I enjoyed the concepts involved with the 'following' theme and felt it worked on different levels. I think it touches on a variety of topics around the subject of humanity, and whilst it doesn't give you any particular insight, you can take from it what you want. Ultimately I found it quite lighthearted, refreshing and clean, with a good splash of moodiness and intrigue. Worth watching."
"Jeremy Theobald plays ""The Young Man"", who likes to follow various random people along the streets, since he doesn't seem to have anything else to do. Things go along fine until he starts following a man named Cobb, who turns the tables on him, and enlists him to take his hobby a step further and break into the apartments of those he follows, since he knows they are away. Little does the young man know that Cobb has sinister plans for him, and the attractive blonde woman he befriends...Unique and unpredictable film tells its story in a matter-of-fact way, yet unfolds its story carefully, building to a surprise twist ending. Christopher Nolan's feature film debut is impressive(if small-time), though much bigger things await him in the future..."
"The movie is short, but apt. What I liked most about the movie was that it was Nolan's first actual movie and yet he has shown the signs of the ace director/writer that he would eventually be. The movie has characters and storyline straight out of a Dostoevsky title. You may like the movie if you have a taste for such movies.The movie keeps moving between the present, the past and the future. And well you can't actually miss any scene, since it is pretty tightly packed. It would have done even better with some soundtrack. but i guess most debutant directors generally make movies minus music. A slight warning, the entire movie is in black and white, and as already mentioned pretty fast."
"A young writer who follows strangers for material meets a thief who takes him under his wing.After seeing Nolan's work with Memento, I became highly interesting in this highly interesting movie. The movie is shot in black and white, much like a noir style. The movie's structure seems to be very similar to Memento's which leads me to think that this was somewhat of a blueprint of Memento. I do find this movie interesting, while shot in a low budget, it seemed like Nolan could've done better. The story is interesting but suddenly falls. Why? I don't know, this movie is really not my cup of tea and it doesn't strike my interest as it had some. So really, big Nolan fans alike, will love it or hate it. I personally disliked it but that's just my opinion. I rated it 5 for his work to impress others. And I knocked down 5 since it did not keep my interest for very long. 5/10."
"Following has several Nolan staples: the non-linear/winding narrative, sharp twists and has some of his patent camerawork. Truthfully, I did mistake it for a obscure indie film but cool to see his roots. A succinctly bow wrapped budget feature that may not stick with you but is worth the hour. Do recommend."
"Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, over three years ago. I went in with no expectations since Christopher Nolan was a no-name at the time, but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at that festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood. Mr.Nolan gave a good account of its making at the end, enough to put anybody off starting out as a film-maker! I liked it better than Memento although this was, perhaps, due to the lower expectations. And the fact that it was more of an art house movie."
"After turning it over in my head for a few days, I've decided I like this film. It has a very simple look to it. The black and white, the complete absence of elaborate sets or costumes, the unknown actors, it all creates a very film noir kind of atmosphere. You really get the feel of the main character through all the flashbacks, how confused he gets and how he gets used. And it's a relief to see a relatively short film again for a change. These days, two hours seems to have become the standard. It's nice to see that a good story does not necessarily need a very long time to evolve. In Following every scene counts, nothing is superfluous."
Following is the best independent film to ever come out of England.  A truly inspiring masterpiece!
"Christopher Nolan's debut feature film is a tightly crafted thriller that cleverly twists and turns. It's remarkable that Nolan managed to execute the film so seamlessly, considering he made it on a shoestring budget of around six thousand US dollars, filming on weekends with his friends.Despite the absence of a grand scale often associated with Nolan's work, the film still contains his signature elements. The sharp, non-linear editing is paired with an unpredictable and intriguing narrative, while an exciting score enhances the suspense.However, the movie falls short in terms of acting and dialogue. Though the performances are not entirely amateurish, they feel somewhat dry and detract from the overall engagement. Nevertheless, Nolan's directorial prowess shines through, making this debut a promising start to his illustrious career."
"Christopher Nolan's first film is a 'no budget' black and white film about a unemployed writer who begins following strangers, which in turn leads to robbery and also violence. It is very good.Like in his later film 'Memento' he doesn't present the story in a linear way. Instead it jumps around somewhat so you end up really sucked in trying to piece it all together and early, apparently random, shots take on significance as the film progresses. This style also means the twists are much more effective.Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance (especially if you like his later work and/or Film Noir)"
"CAUTION!  There's kind of a spoiler in here.  I don't think it'll ruin the movie, but if you want to really watch the film with no expectations, I would stop reading now  I don't want to take too long here, as most of the other comments have documented the strengths of this film quite well (and it does have many strengths).  Overall, I found this to be a solid, interesting movie, but my major complaint is that the entire plot seemed way too silly. I don't see any reason why Cobb would create such an elaborate plan to do what he did.  It seemed to me that Nolan just set up this story as a way to show off his directorial/writing talents rather than to really tell a story. This wasn't nearly as interesting or emotionally-appealing as Memento.  I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars."
"Brit director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America, and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed; but this small film was where he started. And it certainly showcased his talent, with its striking black-and-white cinematography and achronological storytelling that prefigures his later 'Momento', albeit in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanistically, the plot reminded me of David Mamet's 'House of Games', but the film still feels fresh and sharp, right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected, but whose pointedness is unexpectedly delicious. The acting, on the other hand, is not quite in the same class - the film has a stylised quality, and possibly to a greater extent than the director intended. But it's still a fine debut, simultaneously claustrophobic and beguiling."
"POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN.The movie opens with dialogue between the main character and a police detective.  The main character, identified as ""the young man"" makes the following statements:  ""I've been on my own for awhile and getting kind of lonely and bored.  Nothing to do all day.  And that's when I started shadowing.""The main character, in a warped and infringing state of mind, begins to follow people only to find out that he is likewise being followed, set up, and framed.  Like attracts like, unfortunate for him in this case.  His original motives were not harmful, only loneliness, boredom, and overinterest in other peoples' lives; infringement.  He used the fact that he aspired to become a writer as an excuse for his behaviours.The movie is presented in non-linear time movement sequences cognitive-wise and there are many similarities between this film, Christopher Nolan's first work released in 1998, and Memento released in 2001."
"Christopher Nolan's first feature film is filmed in black and white and has an interesting premise, a man follows random strangers to learn about their lives. The young man ""Bill"" (Jeremy Theobald) confesses his strange hobby to a listener as he lays out different encounters he has following people. His person is to accumulate stories to write about. He makes up rules so as not to get caught following others but when he does follow another man Cobb (Alex Haw), the man confronts him. Cobb takes him on his daily life breaking and entering people's houses just to violate their stuff and learn about them. Bill feels guilty and will often return to interact with the individuals whose house he has entered.The film's story plays out of order and a viewer can identify which time period it is by the changing appearance of the main character. He is battered and bruised in some scenes and in others, he has long hair and shabby or is well-dressed and clean cut. In the storyline that follows him battered, he is planning a robbery of a bar. In the middle storyline, he woos a blonde woman (Lucy Russell) who he had previously robbed. She has a relationship with an abusive guy who beats up men who owe him money. She is afraid of this man, but she still goes with the main character on a date to a coffee shop and invites back to her place, where he had previously snooped.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
"Chris Nolan's labyrinth like noir about voyeurism and identity is amazing from start to finish. A first film is as complex as ""Memento"" or ""The Prestige"", though maybe a little harder to get a handle on. Still it smacks of originality and creative drive, and has a ""twist"" as intellectually challenging as it is realistic pulp. Few film makers have made as good of use of their editors and attention to narrative that Nolan has. The story is about a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street, until he follows someone, whose noticed him following others, and has been following him in tern, from there the complexity escalates and identities begin to rearrange. More naturalistic and realist than Nolan's later work but just as razor sharp."
"This was one of the slowest films I've seen. I get the idea that this was intentional. It was? Oh. O.K. then. I'll take your word for it. Shot in Black and white. Yeh that was clever. Well not really. This was always a black and white flick. Suspense ! What suspense? I must have missed that, Was it when he was messing about with the time shift? The ending? Great. But does the ending justify the means. Almost. But not quite. Great for a first movie. This guy will get better. He does? Oh yeah. Memento. Really weird, but better. Insomnia? Yeah, now he's cooking. I await his next film. Batman Begins, is it? Wow, there'll be no "" Holy haberdashery, Batman! ""in that one."
"Christopher Nolan's ""Following"" is a solid albeit short film. It is a well-acted and original piece of work. Not a minute of film is wasted. Every scene has importance. I personally believe it is as good as his much more popular ""Memento."" (*** out of **** stars)"
"Seems weak compared to other Nolan movies. The reason for this is Nolan himself. He did such excellent work after that that this movie seems weak, but it's a very good movie."
"The story is about a man who follows people to learn more about them, and stumbles into the world of break-ins and robberies. It is told in a really fragmented storyline which makes it kind of like you are solving a crime, and following these people, putting it all together. It is clever, and a great premise, but it got hard to follow, especially when both men had the same haircuts, did strange things, and didn't fully introduce plot-twists. It is a good story, and a good movie. I really do suggest you watch it, if you have 70 minutes to spare.Also, it is only rated R because of f-bombs and a couple fight scenes. No sex scenes or anything.Worth a watch!"
"It's utterly irrelevant to me whether this movie had a budget of 6 thousand, 6 million, or 600 million dollars. I only care about the end-result, what I get on the screen. ""Following"", despite its ultra-short length of 70 minutes, required me to watch it in 3 sittings (sleepings) - that's how dull it was in parts. Not badly made, but after the interesting first several minutes, the movie goes nowhere i.e. it turns into a mere run-of-the-mill noir drama. Who cares if it's written and presented in broken form? I've seen so many films done that way, it doesn't get me excited anymore at all. It's still just another double-cross crime film, the kind of cliché crap one could have expected from a Huston/Bogart team-up. Yawn. I had expected something more unique to develop out of the initial premise of the central character following people. I wouldn't have even viewed this film had I known its plot was so standard.The twists and the story are not only not interesting, but quite far-fetched. The woman's character isn't properly fleshed out. ""Memento"" was considerably better. This was just a solid little early effort, nothing more. No need to get ecstatic, people..."
"Nolan does in this short movie, what Darren Arronofsky failed to do the same year with ""Pi"". He overcomes a micro budget with superb writing and great structure. The tension goes always up, and we get to know details of the story little by little (contrary to what Darren did), with characters that felt realistic and weren't annoying (contrary to what Darren did). With every new piece of information we get a clearer picture of what is happening, culminating in an efective and twisty ending that shows how great Nolan was destined to be since the very start.Low budget masterpiece."
"You wanna see a mind blown story, and a super engaging noir movie in a kind of psycho environment. Nolan did it superbly!"
"A suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production. Features performances from no-name actors that rival the top talent on the planet (sadly none have persued a career). Also features the the god-like ability of Christopher Nolan to write perfect dialogue. Dialogue is what carries this story, which is about a man who likes to follow people for material for his books. Well shot, VERY well edited, even better written, and amazingly well performed.This movie has everything a great film needs, except people who have seen it. 9/10"
"This film is superb, it has the same low-budget first film feel of 'Pi' and 'Clerks', but has the style of 'Memento' (also by Writer/Director Christopher Nolan). The score, sound effects, photography and editing are almost 'Memento' prototypes, and the story shows that Christopher Nolan is best when Writing and Directing. Don't be put off by the low-budget look and acting, or even the short length of the film, and just watch it!"
"Following stands as Christopher Nolan's first venture into filmmaking. Although it is sometimes deemed a student film due to its limited budget, this film is way ahead many student films in many aspects. With $6,000 at his disposal and a concise 60-minute runtime, you can observe the early stages of Nolan's distinctive filmmaking style. While the script may lag at times, as well as the acting, it still has the carefully constructed plot with a twist or two often found in many if not all of Nolan's works. For the lovers of Nolan, diving into this film provides a valuable look into his progression and how far he has traveled in his cinematic journey."
"For a long time, I've been dying to see this movie. I absolutely love Christopher Nolan and I wanted to see all of his films, especially the one that started his career. Wow, not only did it exceed all expectations I had for it, but I think it might be my new favourite of his work. The story is brilliant. It's constructed in a nonlinear style and takes a lot of ingenious twists and turns. The characters are so well written. They feel so convincing and are very interesting. The editing and cinephotography are also excellent. I absolutely love the low budget feel. Overall, this film is incredible and I highly recommend it."
"Having enjoyed Memento so much, it was intriguing to see this director playing some of the same mind games, using jump cuts and disruptive scene arrangements to tell the story. I have to watch this again, because by the time I saw what was going on, I missed the train. This is simple and well done. Of course, one needs to have some motivations for actions. I suppose power and cruelty are at the center. Perhaps even mental illness is a factor. I felt a bit voyeuristic as these men went into apartments and thought about some of my possessions and how people would just me if they started sifting through things. Anyway, for an hour or so, it captivates and pulls one along. I would have liked to see a little more exposition at the opening and allow us to get to know the central figure a bit more, his obsessions, and his activities. Still, it works pretty well."
"This is an excellent film, but Momento (Nolan's other big budget film) is much better . I would recommend people go to see Momento and then if they like that, see this film. THe film is shot in black and white which I was a bit annoyed with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen. It is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely clever. Elements of the storyline i think are a bit daft but the film is definitely worthy of a second viewing. To conculde the film has a clever plot, clever twists and turns, very good acting and bearing in mind the budget of the film I have to say that it is pretty amazing."
"It's weird watching this film after having seen all of Nolan's other films up to this point. I found myself thinking, ""Man, he's done this subjective non-linear storytelling to fool the audience thing a lot now"" and then realizing oh yeah this was the first. He gets much better at it, suffice to say. There isn't much else to this film besides its slight of hand, and it kinda drops some of the throughlines pretty fast (so much for the eponymous title after about 15 minutes). But as a thesis about what Nolan would become, it's interesting enough."
"Following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood.  The plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology.  The event sequence complicates following Following.  If you are willing to pay attention, it is an exciting movie full of noir earmarks. With the running time at 70 minutes, there is a lot to take in, but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralled.Bill is a lonely, untidy fellow who takes up shadowing people and seeing where they go-what they do.  He is a bit too conspicuous, however, and eventually gets caught by a well dressed, clean-cut bloke named Cobb.  Cobb entangles Bill in a world the poor boy is not prepared to live in.  Cobb is a smart rogue who seems to have complete control over the other characters. By the end of the film the disjointed story is explained thoroughly.  The film is an excellent first effort from the talented Christoper Nolan, who would go on to make Memento, one of the most original movies of our time."
"There are two things that I noticed in this film. (This is not a spoiler, just a mistake in storytelling.) When Cole takes Bill to his first B&E, he finds the ""box"". As soon as Cole finds it he says, ""The box. Everyone's got a box"". A minute later, just before he dumps the contents on the floor he says, ""We're actually very fortunate. You don't see these often"".Observation #2 (Spoiler Alert!)I had to watch the thing three times, I couldn't figure a couple of things out. Then I watched the Chronological version and saw that they were having flash backs from the latter to the previous during the time changes. So at some points we were actually watching three different times in about 1 min of wall time.That was a good thing because I don't know how many more times I could watch it before returning it to Netflix.Color me obsessive."
"It certainly took me long enough to finally see Nolan's debut (not a huge, huge fan) and it reminded me a lot of Darren Aronofsky's debut, Pi. I don't think it's quite as good as that, and it seems like it could've done something even more with its premise (which is itself pretty perfect for a neo-noir thriller). The two lead characters are definitely interesting and their dialogue intriguing, but the story somehow fizzles out as it goes along. Still, the atmosphere is undeniable and the suspense and the tone really admirable. It's a real mood piece in a way Nolan never made again (if maybe only with Memento). This is recommended."
"Done in BW, this modern tale is disconcerting in its erratic time sequences. It appears to start with a young, unemployed writer telling his plight to a counselor. Then maybe he really isn't a writer but just a bum justifying laziness. Then a male subject he is studying turns the tables on him. A female sex object appears from several entry points at once. Crimes start happening, but who is the criminal and who the victim? Is the club owner/gangster the chief villain? Is the finale really the end? If you want to tie it up neater than that you can, but the ends keep coming loose.Fair entertainment for a rainy afternoon."
"I'm amazed that Memento (which is an excellent flick) is so well-regarded in the Top 250 and this one doesn't even appear!! What the hell is that?? To be honest - when this movie ended my knee-jerk reaction was that this movie is better than Memento. After the euphoria of the fabulous ending wore off, I concluded that they are equal in their excellence. I am just confused about why its not in the Top 50 along with Memento. I'm going to venture a guess that (sadly) it's because it's in black and white or because (again sadly)that the characters all have British accents ...sadly because that is no reason to not appreciate a great movie like this.I'm telling you that if you loved Memento, you will love Following as well. Brilliant!"
"Christopher Nolan makes his first full film directorial debut with this quirky Indy film about a young Brit(Jeremy Thebold), who has an odd obsession of following people. He just picks out strangers and shadows them. Curious about where they go, and relatively harmless...at first. He picks out a sharp dressed young man named Cobb(Alex Haw)that actually has the same ""hobby"". The two like-minded men graduate to breaking and entering; taking what they want and leaving odd, but obvious things out of place just to play with their victim's mind. As the story seems to jump to and fro, you don't actually have a good time line. Some clever scenes will hold your interest; but things get real good when a gritty blonde(Lucy Russell)lets the two men know they have met their match. My favorite scene is when you watch one of these ""followers"" duct tape a ton of money to himself. Nolan not only directs;he writes just as well. Keep on your mind that he moves on to MEMENTO and THE DARK KNIGHT. Nolan proves to deserve his following."
"Great British director Christopher Nolan (Momento, Insomnia), directs this odd film about a struggling writer obsessed with following people. This proves harmless at first but soon turns dangerous after taking the game a step further after meeting a like-minded man who shows him the ins and outs of breaking and entering. The two men soon get in over their heads in a strange world involving the mafia and prostitution. Jeremy Theobald plays the writer and Alex Haw the like-minded friend. Both are great performances. This low budget movie was shot total guerrilla-style with no permits for any locations and no big stars but has what a lot of huge budget films don't have which is a clever script and creative direction. An impressive debut by one of todays best directors. Good Stuff!"
"This is definitely Nolan's most intimite,and thought-provoking piece. Not to say that Memento or Insomnia are bad,but they were definitely up to more Hollywood standards...while Following is more of an indie flick. The story is very brilliant,and very well developed. Overall...watch this if your a fan of any of Nolan's work,I'm sure you'll be able to appreciate it more."
"This movie has all the makings of a Hitchcock classic.  The mere fact that this was his first film and made on almost no budget, lends credence to his talent.  If you enjoy Film Noir thrillers similar to the Coen Bros. ""Blood Simple"", then you must watch this film. After watching Memento (Nolan's 2nd film and my first by him) I immediately realized how powerful & complex his filmmaking style really is.  The B&W shots in this film beautifully depict the simplicity of the character and story, and yet with Nolan's ingenious style he is able to weave you into the web of evil that falls upon our main character. I look forward to Nolan's next films as he is obviously on the way to becoming another ""must see"" small budget (non-Hollywood) director.I would put his films in the same creative realm as Quentin Tarantino, Wes Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson, & Guy Ritchie."
"This is a great film, and I wish more people had seen it.  Superior in some ways to Memento, it can also be seen as a progressive step that lead to Memento.  As some have said, at the begining the jumps between past and present are not always obvious, but I feel it works in the film's favour and adds an element of ""what the hell is going on?""  This only makes the ending more enjoyable and creepily satisfying."
"Memento is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I went and saw Insomnia and loved it.  So I'm in the library and I see ""Following"" on DVD, and I think, well, Christopher Nolan rocks excessively, so I got it and watched it.  I'm not going to say anything about the plot because it really isn't that deep and it's probably already been told by other reviewers, but I just really didn't find this movie satisfying.  Sure, it's well done and has an interesting sequence of events and a plot twist near the end, but still, nothing about this movie really reached in and played with my brain like Memento, or even Insomnia, did.  It's still worth seeing though, and Nolan is still a director to watch, and I can't wait to see how he expands with his next film."
I saw this film right after Memento (which was fabulous) and liked it almost instantly. Both the main characters have interesting 'ticks' and when they team up you feel something interesting's coming up. The ending is perhaps a bit too twist-and-turny but overall I really enjoyed it. Oh and did I say I love black/white movies? They almost always work for me. I'll give this one 7/10.
"Ah, clever and just exquisitely good. This film accomplished more in just a little over an hour than most films achieve in 2+ hours. As it is directed by Nolan of ""Memento,"" the movie's plot sequence is backwards and will leave you breathless at the end. Black and white at its best.Personally, I favor Following over Nolan's other films."
"With a mere budget of $3000 and not released under the tag of a known production company ,this movie just failed to gain much attention.Presented in the old black and white ,it is this movie with which we were introduced to the genius of Christopher Nolan.
It has an excellent screenplay mingled with flashbacks and narration . It is a 1 hr 10 min worth spending film."
"Such a jaw dropping moment at climax. The director tells an extraordinary crime story within 1h in his feature film. The story was simple but how he expressed to audience in a Non Linear screenplay makes the film Amazing. Lots of Twist makes us jaw dropping but the viewers can't understand this movie by watching at once, it may take twice or thrice to understand that's the UNIQUENESS OF SIR CHRIS NOLAN. don't miss"
"I've enjoyed most of Christopher Nolan's movies and this one isn't really an exception. It certainly isn't as good as his later stuff, but for one of his first endeavors and, what looks like a shoestring budget, I am kind of impressed. The plot is pretty simple, but an interesting concept and the script is pretty intelligent. I like the interaction between the two main characters. It's quirky. An artist with a weird need to follow people around bumps into a thief and they form an interesting bond that goes a little wrong. It's got little twist, nothing jaw dropping, but I was surprised. It's black and white, I think more for effect than the budget because I think, and these days color film is probably as cheap as black and white. It's got a bit of this 90's hipster retro beatnik feel to it and the black and white film adds to that. I don't recognize any of the actors in it. It's all nobodies. Again, don't expect a lot, but you may appreciate this one if you are a Christopher Nolan fan."
"Following is a brilliant black and white zig-zag movie about deceit.The cast is,although few in numbers and not famous, very good. The story is difficult to understand and gets clear only in the last few minutes of the movie, just like in Nolan's other masterpiece Memento. Of course, I saw Memento first or else I probably wouldn't have noticed Following. Even while some parts of the scripts are alike, like flashbacks and flashforwards these are two absolute different movies.Christopher Nolan shows that he is a brilliant Thriller-director and writer, because he keeps the viewer on the edge of his or her seat for the entire movie and then surprises the viewer with a superb climax.Like Memento I gave Following 10/10."
"this is by far and away the most pretentious film i have seen this year. he is just getting going with the cutting around with time business from memento but the characters are utterly unbelievable, like the wettest middle class boy's ideas of what gangsters and chancers would be like in london. i barely made it to the end.  only if you love memento."
"I believe that Nolan is one of the best directors in 21th century but not for this movie, for me the movie must getting the attention of viewers in such a way that make you following the tale of movie and this is Nolan has perfect for it.the other point is that in Nolan's movie you must wait for something that making surprise you and also certainly narrative of story is vague and mystery. I already watching Memento, Inception, Prestige,Dunkirk and Insomnia and I figure out the way of Nolan has not changed.
about the movie I have to say that the story was new for me and like it, even so I told myself""what a cool job! why myself don't it "". I mean that following the different people and also gathering the information of them, it is amazing."
"Even with its short runtime, Following manages to cram in plenty of character development and plot twists. This feels a lot like a student film, though, which is probably because Christopher Nolan filmed it piece by piece over the course of a year with barely any budget. It's interesting to see how far Nolan has come since Following, but it's still a film worth watching."
"The narrator, a writer, admits to being lonely and bored.. when he starts following random people. Although he calls it ""shadowing"" at first...which may be less surreptitious in his own mind. And he had rules, at first. But he admits when he started breaking his own rules, that's when the troubles started. Although he tells people he's between jobs. So which is it? Is he a writer or not? And when he gets caught by cobb, a cat burglar, they start breaking into apartments together. Of course they will get caught eventually. Can they come up with a good enough story to get out of this mess? It's a study of cat burglers, pushing their luck. And getting caught up in bigger crimes. Some twists and turns. Done in black and white, to add to the mystique. Written and directed by christopher nolan. But it's a family project... his wife and his uncle are in it as well! This was nolan's first, full length feature film. He recently won two oscars for oppenheimer. And was nominated for more along the way."
"Christopher Nolan uses his signature fragmented story telling skills to tell a gripping tale. The film is intriguing when viewed the first time. Like most of Nolan's movie, the cards fall in place in the end to complete the picture. While this works well for complex plots, the plot at the heart of this film is straightforward. Hence the fragmented narrative, especially on second viewing, seems as a forced attempt by the director to complicate a simple story. That said,the movie is well-directed and you can see glimpses of the genius that Nolan would eventually show in Memento and The Prestige. The movie is an engaging watch and with its short running time, the first viewing is breezily exciting. And since the plot is simple, there aren't many alternate theories that need to thought of to understand the intelligence of the movie. Overall, a delightful when first viewed. Repeat viewings may not be that pleasing."
"After seeing ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia"" I decided that Christopher Nolan was my favorite new director.  I was lucky enough to see an add in the paper for ""Following"" playing at the local College and I didn't want to miss it. Nolan tells the story of a struggling writer who finds himself in a world of trouble when he tries a new style of creating characters.  The movie uses the same technique as in ""Memento"" where the same story is told at different times and all the stories come together at the end for a brilliant ending."
"Christopher Nolan's extremely low-budget, high-concept debut is one nasty character. Cerebral and verbose, it lulled me into a trance with long, casual chats about the practice of breaking and entering as a social experiment, then suddenly smacked me with a sharp jerk of the wheel that skewed everything. Appropriate, effective use of hand-held cameras give the screen a disheveled, voyeuristic look and feel that had me averting my eyes out of guilt and embarrassment once or twice. A very small, casual cast seemed to know that's what Nolan was after, and played it up beautifully, with sudden piercing glares that often shot straight through the lens. The concept of non-linear narration may be starting to feel a bit played out at the moment, but when used with care and efficiency it can still be a powerful, effective means to a surprise end - and this is a great example of that. An unusually brief run time (70 minutes) may seem short at a glance; worry not, it'll stay with you for days."
"This movie was never on my watchlist but as it was a part of Nolan's filmography I gave it a try.The movie was a decent drama that had a resemblance to 1959's Pickpocket. The story was simple with good twists and turns, the screenplay was also good as it didn't feel stretched, the direction was good but the performances were decent. In the end, it was Nolan's debut movie and also an independent movie so I won't complain about the quality of the movie.Overall, it was a good drama thriller which might not be everyone's cup of tea but you can try it if you have watched movies like Pickpocket."
"This is what Nolan makes clear by creating this film. His low-budget-production who costs just nearly 6 000 dollar is more than a lovely evening entertainment. Those one who liked ""Memento"" would love this work. The subtle narrative style is similar and also different. You can follow the plot easier but it's still confusing, too. Hints who are given guide you in a blind alley or put you off the scent. The story of the unemployed author who spy on other people become a great atmosphere because of the black-and-white filming. This style especially helped Nolan to fog the character of the disingenuous Cobb. Nolan also adumbrate his talent to make the audience get a feeling with the protagonist without letting him get to close to the character. But also work out a difficult personality. This movie about the fantasy of voyeurism and the unforeseeable results is a must-see both the interested viewer and the film-noir-fan."
"Here Christopher Nolan (Memento) is already experimenting with the kind of fragmented story-telling that would win him wide acclaim with the aforementioned Oscar nominee. This tale of a lost young man who becomes entangled in a web of deceit is as interesting and engrossing as Memento, if not as stirring. The fragementing and disorder of the story keeps you on your toes, and you really don't know anything until you've seen the end, which is when you know EVERYTHING. an interesting movie from a writer-director to keep your eyes on."
"This film was very well done and the shots were unique enough for me to take note of them for films of my own. Personally i'm not a big black and white fan but there was something about this that seemed soothing to my eyes, unlike most black and whites. Also the actors were great, they did an excellent job portraying their characters. I loved how the actor portraying Cob made me hate him so much, especially at the end. When it comes to the plot, this story is very unlike traditional Hollywood films with happy endings, for 15 minutes I was arguing with myself over wither or not a hated or loved this movie. I'm not sure, but i think this is either Christopher Nolan's 2nd or 3rd film and even if this was his 5th i would still be astounded. I don't know much information about the scores in this film or if they were original, but I felt that they went along with the film very smoothly and fit the scenes perfectly."
"Warning:  Possible Spoiler Contained WithinThis film might not change your life, it might be rough in some spots, but it is definitely worth seeing.  The story is interesting, the characters, while not perfect, are believable.  Some fascinating ideas are presented during the course of the film and the ending leaves you feeling as if Cobb has put one over on you as well.  Although I'm not ready to label Christopher Nolan as ""the next Hitchcock"", the comparison can be made without too much of a stretch.  All in all, this film was 71 minutes well spent."
"1)Always wear a tie, and preferably, make the rounds with another guy. That way, you can casually use the bottom end of the tie to press the doorbell, without leaving a traceable fingerprint. (What about the second guy? I cannot remember if this was an implicit or explicit tip, but two young guys in ties are the universally recognized symbol of religious proselytizers. The addendum to this rule, which Cobb's protégé ""the young man,"" aka Bill, aka Danny, ignores at first, is to always be clean-shaven.) 2)Always carry latex gloves in your pocket. If your tie does not bring anyone to the door--and if no neighbors are around--you put the gloves on OUTSIDE the to-be-burgled home, PRIOR to entry.3)Look for the homeowner's ""hidden"" key before picking their lock with a credit card. (Finding and using the key is usually faster.)4)""Everyone has a (keepsake) box."" Find and rifle through that first, as burglars should ""take things away to show (victims) what they HAD"" (not the least of which was their pre-burglary peace-of-mind).P.S.--Perhaps there are other burglary tips that could be derived from real-life burglary victim\FOLLOWING director Christopher Nolan's film, but these are the ones that stood out for me."
"After seeing ""Memento"" for the first time I discovered that this film was out there somewhere.  It is definitely an obvious precursor to the short term memory thriller.  Do not let the lack of major players scare you off. In my humble opinion, the lack of big names actors make the film all that more likable.  Is it just me or does the lead look an awful lot like Eric Clapton?"
"Earliest work of Nolan as a director, better yet, a story teller. Here, Nolan, gives instructions of how to tell a story as twisted as possible, without making it too complicated. This movie is a good way of getting to know a younger Nolan, specially if this wasn't your first time watching his work. Much likely, you had seen his later works such as The Prestige and Inception before this one. So, it's nice to go back and see how it all started.
This movie in structure is very simple, low budget, no famous actors and special editing.
Yet, it doesn't lack anything. It's prefect as it is. Happy to have seen this movie. And I recommend everyone to watch it; specifically, if you're a Nolan fan just like me."
"It's smart, deep and keeps you thinking, I loved the plot twist it was amazing. Nolan is easily my favorite director of all time. 9.5/10"
"Wow, what a debut from Nolan. He defined his style for the start. I love his non linear stories and Memento is a great follow up to this movie. It is cool that one door had Batman sign on like Nolan knew he will do Batman films."
"It is crazy how amazing christopher nolan is. this was his first movie, written, directed and shot by him. in black and white with 4:3 dimensions. this is the definition of a low budget film ($6k). a phenomenal, clever, creative story. (3 viewings)"
"Definitely a pre-""Memento"" film for Nolan (even the music was the same . . . or at least by the same person). Kind of a Sisyphus method of getting a story across, but it definitely worked for me. Makes me wonder if ""Inception"" will see Nolan return to these roots, utilize his ""Batman"" skills or combine the two. I have a feeling that it's the last option."
"I loved 'Memento', and was excited to see the release of Nolan's first film, 'Following'.  I wasn't sure what to expect, and I think that is the best way to approach this movie.  I will say it is very confusing, but has a very satisfying ending where all your questions are answered.  Imagine watching 'Memento' and knowing exactly what was going on at the end.  That is 'Following'.  Is it better to know the answers?  Stop reading reviews.  Go in blind.  Watch this movie, find out for yourself."
"Following is Christopher Nolan's debut film, which he shot in black and white on a $3,000 budget. The finished product is a fast 70 minute thriller with multiple surprising plot twists. Following is film noir at its finest."
"Not only is this film a wonderful addition for anyone who was a fan of Nolan's later film ""Memento"", but the director's commentary in the Special Features section of the DVD includes wonderful information for anyone who's interested in making their own low budget film."
"I gave this film a 9 because of how incredible it turned out to be despite its limitations in budget and production.No special effects or gimmicks. No fancy lighting or high-budgeted shoot locations. Just a good story to be told and a masterful way of storytelling. That's the heart of this film.I specially enjoyed the non-linear storytelling. I paid close attention to the film as soon as I realized this, and boy, as I reached the ending, everything that happened in the first few parts of the film just made sense.Some of the acting looks unrealistic such as the beatings and Bill and Cobb's fight scenes, but overall, it is still a great movie!"
"""Following"" was a great film.  It was surprisingly short, but still worth it.  It was by the same director of ""Memento"" (Christopher Nolan) and you can tell!  It's got the same style and a similar way of putting it together, by mixing up the plotline.  It's a bit confusing when you first start watching, and that's what keeps you magnetized to the screen.  You have to see what happens next!  And by the time you think you have it figured out, another twist is thrown in to bewilder you even more!  After everything's tied up at the end, you'll leave the movie stunned at what you just encountered!  I recommend it to all those people who like unusual, yet intelligent movies.  In fact, I would recommend it to everyone!"
"I chose to see this on a flight to London (Virgin had these neat little portable personal video players with a choice of independent films). Very interesting style of filmmaking - some flashbacks which remind me of his current film in theaters, Momento.  Can't say much about the plot without giving it away, but I highly recommend this film - it was riveting, even on a 4"" screen."
"I just shocked when i saw this movie and i think about that this made by an 28 years old director for his first movie with 6000$ budget only!!! Following serves as an interesting contrast to Memento. Characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively. In that sense, both reminded me somewhat of ""In the Company of Men,"" also highly recommendable. One difference between Nolan's two films is that Memento was a little easier for me to follow, given that the b&w scenes progress in a constant chronological direction, and so do those in color. I don't think that was true of Following, where scenes seemed to be shown at random. If you have the choice between VCR and DVD, I'd highly recommend DVD, since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in chronological order, not just in the scrambled (albeit ingenuous) order presented by Nolan. It also makes it easier, upon a second viewing, to piece the order together for yourself, if you want to."
"Interspersed with narrative, sound logic, and a story that reverses and reverses again, it's the first time I've really seen Nolan's awesome film."
"Intense! the from-nowhere-to-somewhere-and-vice-versa editing format which is typical to Christopher Nolan, roots to this first gig of this now-ultimate director. the story-telling was promising and definitely a nice portfolio for a future high profile director."
"Following is a very good debut from a filmmaker that will in future make some great films and instant classics.Following may not be my favourite film of his but still this is surprisingly very good directed and written film and it proved how Nolan even in his early days was a great talent that will have a great future in front of him.Story was on paper very simple but thanks to a very good script,good use of tension and some good acting ,this film was to me one of best debuts that i ever seen.I would say that it is on par with films like Hard Eight and Pi that come out during 90s and in end Following was a great film to see"
"""Following"" is the first movie of Nolan but it's one of the last as i watched of his filmography. Some elements in the movie proves it : few scenes with the camera shaking, the duration of seventy minutes, the wife and uncle of Christopher Nolan whom plays in the movie...The movie is a bit hard to follow because some scenes are not in the chronological order. Except that, i liked the story and it's soundtrack.We can see many objects as Nolan will reuse in his others movies : One of the actor of Following is named Cobb like DiCaprio in ""Inception"", the Batman logo on the door of the protagonist, the nonlinear narrative like in Memento..."
"Recently I watched following. It's a very good movie considering of its budget in that time. The idea of shooting movie in black and white was good.Nolan used his typical technique in this movie also like shifting from past to future and vice versa. This gives us a very little information about the movie, and we get engaged throughout the movie.Performance of actor was good. Screenplay was good, I did not get bored while watching the movie. In the end Climax, just say that shocked me. I will not spoil it for u, so you have to go and watch it and trust me you will not get disappointed.It's really an underrated gem of Nolan, give it a try."
"Simply an amazing maiden piece by Nolan that uses London streets and first-time or part-time actors. Its achronological pacing tells the story with an almost perfect 69 minutes on the screen with black-and-white starkness that fits both budgeting and plot.At first, I wanted to see this film's would-be author follow multiple stories and people, but the young man's act of tailing strangers introduces Nolan's true purpose that viewers can follow to and piece together at the end.I highly recommend this picture, especially as a sign of his directing to come. Go back in (and out of) time and check out Following."
"Black and white, white and black, which way does it go, if it goes one way rather than the other? The follower is followed by the one he is following who follows him. The best way to follow someone is to make him follow you. Of course you must have an objective and what is the objective in this film? Clear cut and criminal: to get rid of your girl friend and at the same time to keep the money stolen by the one who was following you and whom you were following in the safe of the bar landlord who was actually ordering the killing of the girl who was no longer a friend, but just a passing entertainment waiting for the end of the story, her death. And what a pleasure to let the one who was following you believe he was following you and even selecting you when in fact you were following him five paces ahead and selecting him as the one who was going to carry your crime to prison. Sorry folks the death penalty has been made illegal in England for so long we don't even remember how it was working in those old days when convicted criminals who might have been innocent were dropped through a trap in the rosy morning of their last day (singular please: no repeat in that kind of show, no rehearsal and no première, just one chance to become famous for at least one day on the media). The film is slightly difficult to follow because the various moments of the story are not in chronological order, Pulp Fiction forever.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"
"Following is definitely a representation of a low-budget movie. Without a sophisticated movie casts and over-complicated story-line, the selling point is the sequential order the story is presented. Similar to his later masterpiece, memento, Christopher Nolan didn't portrayed the movie in a chronological order, instead it is displayed in a ""well-planned"" random manner. Although, the movie may seem to be hard to grasp( it seems to me that is shifts more randomly than memento), Nolan leaves ample puzzles and traces for audience to figure out what is happening after-all. The last 10 minutes of the movie is the essence where bits and pieces in the first 50 minutes build up to the explosion of excitement,events follow one by one , leaving you no time to digest the rich context. The climax is outstanding, especially the twist at the end. Nolan also cleverly uses the conservation between the police officer and the protagonist in the beginning that corresponds with the ending where the young man finally walks out of the mist of ""truth"". This movie probably sets up the definition of a ""though-provoking"" movie. The crime scenes are well set up, giving you a sense that you are fooled around throughout the movie despite your effort to figure out what is going on. I see the villain, Cobb, as Nolan who wants to set up the audience to a "" thought experience"", leaving us spellbound in the cinema."
"Before Christopher Nolan made Inception or The Dark Knight trilogy, he made Following. The story is of a young writer named Bill (Jeremy Theobald) who follows strangers for material. When one of his subjects, a thief named Cobb (Alex Haw) confronts him, Bill starts robbing apartments with Cobb. When Bill meets a girl (Lucy Russell) he starts getting involved in her life as well. Although not quite as complicated as Inception or Interstellar, Nolan's future traits are here, such as his non-linear story telling, and it's still a complicated story. It's a very well put together film noir. Nolan certainly benefited from beginner's luck. Although it's not as good as Inception, The Dark Knight, or Batman begins, I like it better then The Dark Knight Rises and Interstellar. It's an interesting movie and it's very well made for as small as the budget it. If you like Nolan's work, you'll find this pretty interesting."
"We all know what kind of director Christopher Nolan is now since most movie lovers have seen Memento, Batman Begins or The Prestige. However, like any great director, his amateur, low-budget indie films are just as interesting. Following, a 70-minute story about two men in London that break and enter into people's houses, plays more like a TV episode than a movie. Nevertheless, it packs more into it than any TV show could do. Despite being shot in grainy black and white, the film still has a nice look to it, giving the surroundings and characters a sense of gloom and doom in this neo-noir story. The acting is pretty good, despite all the actors being amateurs as well. Still, Nolan maintains serious suspense by borrowing a page from Quentin Tarantino and telling this story completely out of chronological order. Doing this increases suspense as well as keeps the audience interested. So, if you are interested in seeing a low-budget, well-made suspense movie, Following is a good place to start."
"Yes with that small budget Nolan delivered a HIGH CLASS Movie Experience to everyone. The important thing that made this movie so good is the NON LINEAR STORY TELLING of Nolan. Though the story is normal one, he filmed that in a different manner or filmed it at his best. That's the special thing about Nolan. Making the droplet into a flood The cast is really good. All of them performed very well even though the film is shot for a year. Yes the film is very short but you wont realize it at all.. The music is also good.. The film beautifully portrayed some great quotes My Favorite is You take it away and show them what they really have. overall it's a film that should be watched as many times as you like"
"Following is one of Nolan's best work...This film deserves a big production house backing...The Direction,screenplay and the acting seems perfect...It has some resemblance with Memento but still runs on its own...Jeremy has done some excellent acting and his expressions are so real at the end of the film where he confesses to the police and finds out he handed himself over to the police with no evidence to prove his innocence!!We get to see only 3 characters in this film and yet it seems so sufficient...Alex looks convincing..Lucy does her part and looks beautiful as well...Chris Nolan is here to stay and I am waiting for his next film The Prisoner"
"This was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long. There was an aspect of film-noir contained in this movie and I am glad that Nolan picked to film it in black and white. The plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged. Even the dialogue was good along with the acting. It reminded me of what was to come in Memento by not being in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him for example saying ""everyone has a box"" which he put his personal things into. Also, on the writer's door was the batman logo which seemed ironic because Christopher Nolan would later direct Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, two other great movies. There is a great twist in the end which I'm not going to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, even though I kind of figured what would happen when Cobb gave the young man D Lloyds credit card. I also liked how the writer had a copy of The Republic by Plato one of my favorite philosophical books. This is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it, plus it only being an hour long. There is also a circular aspect to it by ending where it began which I thought was pretty brilliant."
"Wow. I was very impressed with this movie. After watching this movie, I can now say with confidence that Christopher Nolan is a genius. At first, I didn't know what to expect with this movie. Of course I had read the back's description... but that didn't prepare me for what turned out to be such an amazing movie. The black and white gives the movie a feel of coldness. One thing I especially enjoyed about this movie was Cobb's dialogue, when they first break into the apartment. It is simply brilliant. It provided so much insight into how we live our lives. I can't recall how many times I thought to myself, ""ya, that's true"". The way the story was structured was great. At first, I didn't expect this so I was really confused. Luckily, I caught on soon enough. Being a fan of Nolan's other masterpiece Memento (where are all the nominations?!), I really love the way he uses time to distort what we perceive. A great feature on the DVD was to play the story in chronological order. I wish this was also done on the Memento DVD. All in all, this was a great movie. If you were a fan of Memento, you definitely need to check this out!"
"When film started i did not think i was going to like it, but i held in there and kept watching. It started to grow on me and then i looked at my Netflix Package and saw that it was Christopher Nolan directing. I had no idea, but then all of a sudden I was watching the film from a different perspective. Isn't that funny. All of a sudden I liked it much better. I feel bad for being so easily persuaded, but nevertheless this was a well made and I am to assume low budget film for Mr. Nolan. Very similar to his Momento"" editing back and forth, forth and back cutting style. I had to watch a few parts over again to understand, but once I did I was glad I watched it over. The acting is okay, the directing is simple. It is nicely shot in black and white, some of it seems over blown but maybe it was ny television. There is a very interesting score as well. I recommend it."
The movie was made in such a low budget that's why it was capable of holding the nerves and story till the end. As it has been a norm with Nolan's movies(I Am A big Nolan Fan)I was more than satisfied to see the end. This movie is still refreshing than any other movie those are coming recently as you can not imagine what's the next scene gonna be. This guy is an amazing director and writer and I don't know how well he understands the complexities of mind that he always adds a new dimension to it. Nolan has this unique style of presenting more than one frames at a time and then masterfully adding every piece. I have never seen anything missing in his movies. The best part of his movies are that he never has a protagonist. You can never guess who's the hero in the movie and as the movie unfolds Nolan always force you to change your opinions.Hats Off Nolan !!
"Christopher Nolan's very FIRST feature film (1998). Only one hour long, and only with $6000 budget, but he already showed his unbelievable storytelling talent. He was born to be a filmmaking genius. I like how he always challenges the audience's intelligence, unlike lots of films treat us like dumb, with Nolan's film, you will have to keep up with him, you have to think fast and think smart not another way around.And, all the answers and twists all get reviewed at the very last second. That satisfaction....That climax...(The film was inspired by Nolan's experience of living in London and having his flat burgled: ""There is an interesting connection between a stranger going through your possessions and the concept of following people at random through a crowd – both take you beyond the boundaries of ordinary social relations"")"
"While Following lacked the tight execution & edits of Memento, it's still impressive considering its budget. Shots are shown slightly out of order, and the black & white 'film noir-y' scenes are well framed and aesthetically pleasing. The main actors are talented and believable, and the script is good. I wasn't too impressed by the soundtrack, though, and there was a choppiness and roughness about the edges. Still, worth seeing.. especially for fans of his other work."
"BigFella Buddha Rating: ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 10Put your thinking cap on your BigFella and get it ready for a psychological thriller. The movie builds up very slowly, but by the end, if your not caught completely by surprise then your BigFella has some exceptional power stored inside of it. The writer and director, Christopher Nolan is well worth watching for in the future.Food Recommendation: ChimichangaIs it a giant egg roll or is a burrito or is it a little bit of both? When you figure this out, you will hold the secret who's side Cobb is on!"
"Although not as amazing in terms of plot as Momento, it was still a really fun film to watch. The black and white was excellent and I really liked the acting. I can't believe they were just friends...I need friends like that for my films!Anyway, Christopher Nolan is one to watch...too bad Insomnia was a little better than average, and in that it was a remake of a 97 norwegian film which was better...Nolan is about intriguing new things, so I hope he goes back to putting original/intriguing ideas on film."
I'd just like to add (if no one has noticed already) the characters resemble famous Hollywood actors. Cobb resembles James Dean and the girl is like Marilyn Manroe and Bill is slightly like Jimmy Stuart. Maybe I'm just insane. But yeah I noticed that.-sway (paxcionnate)
"Christopher Nolan's feature film debut presents him experimenting with the narrative structure of this story along with other filmmaking aspects to carve out his own identity as a filmmaker which later played a key role in his rise in the film industry. Despite being one of the cheapest films ever made, the experience this film provides is actually more satisfying than many multi-million dollar projects."
"I first screened this film in 1998 as a film festival entry.  I immediately gave it my vote for selection.  It is a wonderful twist on what can happen to you when you think you are in control.  Christopher gives us a glimpse of what is going on but, keeps us guessing by showing us the sequence of events in flash backs. How did he get where he is now?  What is really going on? These are the questions that hold your attention.  This is a film that is cerebral and finally acknowledges that film goers need something more than heavy pyro and big car crashes.  It is a breathe of fresh air for the film industry.  If Hollywood is looking for some innovative thinking Christopher Nolan is the man to bring it."
"This is one great movie, I love movies about voyeurs.  The main character Bill is a struggling writer who follows strangers on the street.  He breaks his own rule and follows someone twice.  He gets caught by Cobb a burglar and voyeur himself who takes it a step further than Bill and breaks in and looks through their apartments. I don't want to give too much away, great movie check it out."
"This film presents some interesting ideas and some interesting plot-twists, but I didn't find it to be particularly well-executed.  The dialogue and acting aren't ""tight"" enough, though I think the intent was in the right place.  Nolan returns to some similar themes (collecting, people as the sum of their collection) and formats (the convoluted flashbacks/fragmented time) in Memento and really puts everything together to make a great complete film.  It is interesting to see the progression from Following to Memento, though, and it makes me excited to see how he keeps progressing as he gets more experience with his craftsmanship."
