"Review of Tenet : This is as good as Cinema gets. I didn't expect that Nolan would create such a original movie once again. This is never been done before. It's incredible - one of the best Movies I've ever sen and I actually think that This movie tops Inception.I have seen Tenet now 3 times for the last 2 weeks and tomorrow it's going to be my fourth time.Time never been put on screen like this before. Its mindblowing thrill ride with soundtrack, acting and action that has never been seen on the big screen!10/10I Will watch it again and again and again.The movie has exceptionelly a lot of hidden messages that will blow your mind when you figure it out. This is as I Said as good as cinema gets. Christopher Nolan is the only director that still makes cinema Alive and the only one that makes This big bold unique original movies.
Love This movie. This might be my favourite movie of all time.If you don't understand it see it again!"
"Review of Tenet : Just got home from watching Tenet. Without giving too much away, there is a German Netflix series called Dark, that shares some similarities to this film. One cannot fathom writing such a complex tale, and then conceptualise it on Film. Dark just barely wraps up all the storylines and character arcs in its 3 serie/season run.To think someone could encapsulate such an ambitious 26 episode series into one film is beyond incredible! Christopher Nolan does it in 2 hours and 30 minutes! He is a visual storyteller for the ages. His pacing and storytelling style rival Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Fellini and Godard.There are certain plot holes, and dues ex machinas to be sure. However Mr. Nolan does not give the audience a chance to ponder as he carries you through the narrative with the speed of an M60 machine being emptied by a screaming John Rambo! RaaaaaaAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!! But I digress, Mr. Nolan carries you through the narrative without any obligatory or extemporaneous cues to the audience that lesser formulaic films always do by the mandate of the Hollywood Executives.Given the gravitas of his film portfolio, He now has the power and freedom to tell stories the way he wants to, without the influence of the Hollywood system, that demands films to be dumbed down to movies with a healthy dose of forced romance, and bad CGI prescribed to the general populace.In my humble opinion, it's as if Christopher Nolan is literally telling the audience. YOU ARE SMART! FIGURE IT OUT! And I F**KING LOVE IT!!I'm quite chuffed an Englishman is creating such an original voice in cinema, without flashy gimmicks, or unnecessary eye candy to ensnare the audience's attention.
One could argue his high concept special FX are gimmicky. Consider that any FX used in his films always serve a purpose, to drive the story forward in stead of detract or distract from it.Anywho, as you can tell, I loved this film! There was a few people that walked out of the theatre half way. I can understand how the musical score and intensity of some scenes may be too much and too difficult to follow and absorb. However if you enjoy films that challenge you, and allow you to put the pieces together just as the main protagonist does. Then you will love this film.On a side note: John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, and Kenneth Branagh's performances were outstanding! John comes into his own out of the shadow of his famous father. However I did see that Denzel swagger and cadence in some scenes that are simply genetic. I am thoroughly impressed by Robert Patttinson, with his previous film The Lighthouse. He truly a gifted young actor. I'm looking forward to his turn as Bruce Wayne. I wish him a speedy recovery,."
"Review of Tenet : This movie is one of the best 2020 movies!!!I just want to say "" don't miss seeing this amazing movie
Remember ( focus on every moment)"
Review of Tenet : One of Christopher Nolan's most fascinating movies yet . The inversion concept is unique & outstanding. The performances are excellent. The cinematography is super. Some scenes are simply breath taking. It's a visual art. The action and practical effects are incredible. It does require a lot of concentration and possibly multiple watches.
"Review of Tenet : Christopher Nolan? The man who keeps delivering.. I feel so stupid after seeing his movies the first time, but yet I'm still so impressed. He makes a movie, which I love, but not quite understand completely. I can't stop thinking about it and after some hours, I slowly start to make sense.Tenet was terrific, even tho my brain felt blended."
"Review of Tenet : I loved the cinematography and the epic scale of this movie, it's been a while since i watched some original cinema. concept is very original, i loved the action in reverse and the way it filmed on this epic scale males it the perfect visual treat. Hats-off to chirstopher nolan for this epic action movie."
"Review of Tenet : This is a masterpiece with intense but not too loud music. In response to some comments and critiques: Even as an English learner and while eating nachos socially distanced in a major theater I was able to follow the plot and concept without any problems. While some were quite obvious at a certain point, I still loved every twist and turn. Despite its runtime not a second felt wasted and it mostly cut right to the chase. Best action and most innovative storyline I've seen in a long time."
"Review of Tenet : I am sure that people who dive into the details will find these bits and pieces and time will help to digest the whole story. No matter you hate it or love it but you have to admit that the movies from Nolan are simply so innovative which the current movie industry simply cannot reproduce. He writes the story itself, he directs, chooses the actors, the locations and he mainly uses real world setups instead of computer generated ones. He is so creative and luckily does have the financial background to complete his plans."
"Review of Tenet : I'm speechless!
I don't know what to feel after I watch this movie..
The cinematography, the story, the score - everything about this movie is finesse at it's finest!
Definitely a must watch!"
Review of Tenet : Best comback of Christopher Nolan after Dunkirk . It's marvelous. The fresh inversion concept is simply outstanding. The performances are great. John David Washington is excellent and Robert Pattinson is cool minded done a mature performance and rest of the cast have done a superb job. The cinematography is super. Some scenes are simply breath taking. It's a visual treat. Th action is also very good.
"Review of Tenet : More multi layered and complex than any other Nolan movie, visually stunning and impeccably acted. Experimentalism joins crowd pleasing, is't this true craftsmanship ?Watched a second time in one week, I became an ""inverted"" spectator traveling back in time from the known end. All pieces fall into place and the feeling is unique. This is pure genius and deserves a full rate.And, I found all the words of the Arepo Square, can anyone still think it is a coincidence ?"
"Review of Tenet : My heart has raced before during movie sequences. I don't remember it racing so much during any of my previous experiences. For all those who have seen it, I am referring to the hallway fight sequence. You just know what I am talking about. And it's not just this sequence. There's so much more.And for all others who are yet to see, it is not at all what you think it will be. You are not ready for this. The industry is not ready for this. I don't think even Nolan thought he was ready for this after he saw the final edit. Just one word. TENET, for a long long time from now.Another word, would be simply EXQUISITE.10/10. (Might increase on my second watch)"
Review of Tenet : I am shocked at how low a critics score it has. I have seen the movie twice and it's an amazing experience. I think if shall we say more movie fans went to see this movie it would be 8.7 or 8.6 at least.
"Review of Tenet : Watching this movie was the best movie/cinema experience I have ever had and you should definitely go and experience it too.It had great acting, story, cinematography, music and dialogue. The concept of inversion was worked out perfectly, just like you're used to from Nolan. Sure, it was complicated but if you pay attention it is really never incomprehensible. Because of the concept of inversion you'll set your eyes on things you have never seen before in any movie or series. That is also one of the many aspects that make Tenet a very special movie and a real experience, and an experience you will definitely want to experience again.
In my opinion, if you loved other Nolan movies like Inception, Interstellar, Memento and The Prestige you will undoubtedly absolutely love Tenet too.(I read that some people here had difficulties in hearing the dialogue. I am from The Netherlands so I watched it with subtitles, if you're also watching it with subtitles not hearing the dialogue will certainly not be a problem.)"
"Review of Tenet : Yes. Nolan did it again, repeating his own style he created another masterpeace! Plot of the movie is so complicated that even Inception is like a joke compare to TENET. That's the main reason why I love Nolan, he makes you really think about the plot. It's obvious, you can't understand Nolan's movies from one-time watching, so I'm keeping my ideas this time.
Recommended 10/10"
"Review of Tenet : Tenet ist fantastic and gave me what only few movies did before - a whole new experience.Christopher Nolan delivered something that has never been seen before and made me walk out of the cinema backwards so I can walk in one more time to watch it again.It is a mindtwisting film and it made me talk about it for more than an hour after I watched it for the first time.And yes, it is not perfect as nothing in life is, yet it is a cinematic experience I won't forget and it is an entry in my list of movies you have to see at least once."
Review of Tenet : Such a complex movie .. dont judge from the first time .. watch the movie at least 5 times to understand it ..The protagonist is the inversion of Niel .. and vice versa ...Infinite loop of choices that will determine the fate of the human race ..Remember .. dont think .. just feel it ..Amazing ginzamA
"Review of Tenet : Another Nolan masterpiece. Must watch
Robert Pattinson seems to return to his primr years"
Review of Tenet : What more you expect from a genius? Christopher Nolan movies are not for dumbs even the wise ones need 2-3 viewings before they fully grasp of the happenings. Masterpiece after Interstellar worth risking myself to go watch in theatre in this mess
Review of Tenet : Nolan Nolan Nolan what do you do in this film you blowings us
"Review of Tenet : I don't get the hate, I can understand it's hard to follow, but the plot, sound and visuals are freaking amazing. U realise ure warching a Nolan film from the very beginning and the actors are perfectly chosen, really liked it"
"Review of Tenet : Tenet is a practically perfect (re)introduction to the big screen. Whether audiences are ready - where safe - to return to cinemas en masse is another question entirely. Certainly, Tenet's a more challenging film than some may be comfortable with after a five-month absence, but this is an all-too-rare example of a master filmmaker putting everything on the table with, you sense, not a modicum of his vision compromised. The stakes have never been higher, but Tenet is exactly the film cinemas need right now."
"Review of Tenet : Saw this first on Wednesday and then again today Friday. Left on Wednesday thinking 'Yeah that was great, but so much happened I really need to watch it again'. Left today thinking 'Superb, can I watch it over again as it's that good'.The final sequence with the red and blue squads is superb but only really understood it second time around.As someone else has said I struggled with the sound most of the way through the first viewing. Muffled voices through masks is not helpful but today I got most of it. The sound effects and pace of the film is relentless and doesn't give you a minute to catch your breath.Overall I would say it's fantastic. Just go and the cinema was super safe both times we went."
"Review of Tenet : I never understand Nolan's movies the first time. They're both more complex and simpler than I initially anticipate. As in, there are too many details to fully take in with one viewing but, at the same time, many events and themes overlap with each-other. The answers were already there but I know I'll have to see it a few times to really get it. In the meantime, this movie is stuck in my head like nothing I've ever seen before.Many of the classic Nolan tropes are here - weird time stuff, people in fancy suits explaining rules and one-upping each-other alternately with threats and quips, epic action scenes with shooting, explosions, cars and planes, jittery pounding music, people looking at watches, seeing events from multiple angles, saving the world coming down to personal relationships, etc. There are also interesting themes of lifting yourself up by the bootstraps and transcending or breaking the rules to kind of have your cake and eat it too. Characters do the impossible and we're not sure if they were on top of things the whole time or barely fluked it.Nolan's movies are sometimes criticised for being too pretentious or laborious with exposition, but they're just very intricate and intelligent. Do people want him to explain everything thoroughly or let you work it out for yourself? It's a fine line between accessibility and mystery, not to mention how bold and original he's trying to be. When brand new concepts are being explored, I think a little confusion on the first watch is perfectly reasonable. It's not like Einstein's theory of relativity was immediately accepted as obvious.The music is suitably intense but it was very loud. I think the balance may have been off at my cinema - I couldn't always understand the dialogue which was already tricky to follow. The plot was very tricky to follow although it keeps you involved and excited about where everything's leading. In particular, it's very vague in terms of who the bad guys are or what's actually at stake and why. But the plot thickens and starts to come together quite literally.There were some touches which I enjoyed like the red logos at the start and a blue one at the end and a scene with trains going in opposite directions from each-other forming a nice visual metaphor (those will make more sense once you see the movie).The actors were all really good. Branagh plays a convincing and very nasty Russian or Ukrainian criminal, Pattinson's an intelligent buddy with mysterious intentions while Washington's a likeable and funny protagonist for us to relate to, seemingly as confused as us for most of the film.The main thing that stands out for me is the concept of this movie itself which has never been done before. It's simple and implied in the posters and trailers but I couldn't predict how Nolan would actually make it work. Even if the broader story still has loose ends for me, I can't stop thinking about it. They apparently consulted Kip Thorne or other scientists (I saw his name in the credits) and the physics seem to hold up pretty well under the circumstances. The implications are fascinating and hard to get your head around.Some of the action scenes echo Inception's hallway fight scenes but with a different twist to them. Instead of playing with gravity, Nolan's playing with time. Again, it makes you marvel at what you're watching and how on Earth they filmed it. A lot of clever planning, choreographing, editing and multiple takes I guess. After Tenet, other movies seem so plain and light, what with their exclusively forward motion of time and entropy. Few movies can match the sheer intensity and intricacy of Tenet which I can't wait to watch again. None of Nolan's movies have disappointed me on multiple viewings."
"Review of Tenet : The fact that director Christopher Nolan has a pronounced penchant for philosophy and especially for physics should be known to everyone who knows the films ""Interception"" or ""Interstellar"". Even in the war film ""Dunkirk"" this tendency is present, because there, too, Christopher Nolan develops three chronological storylines that have a different temporal beginning, run completely different in time and still end up in one storyline and always in the same direction. Here the term time still applies according to the principle that many routes of the action always lead to the same destination station and that is the end of the film.Actually, you could call Christopher Nolan the Albert Einstein of film history, but that would be almost an insult. Christopher Nolan is namely the Niels Bohr of film history, who cinematically celebrates his own cinematic universe of quantum physics and its content-related entanglement in a cinematic multiverse. This spooky long-distance effect of the action, which seems to work without time and space, is now the basis for the next film from the microcosm of the Nolan worldview.Christopher Nolan really takes it to the extreme in this film. It is already known that for him the past, the present and the future coexist in a reality, as if it were the train stations of reality and not the time that drives from one to the other aggregate states in order to let this arise. Past, present and future are not the effect of cause time, but time is the subjective individual effect between the causes (stations) present, past and future, which exist at the same time. And now we come to the concept of entropy, which Christopher Nolan uses to the full in this film, because entropy is the ordered timetable so that the individual trains do not collide with each other in reality.Every viewer knows the fact that the effect always comes after the cause. From a mathematical point of view, one can also get back from the effect to the cause, because both directions are mathematically possible, as is the title of the film. No matter from which direction you read the title, it always comes out Tenet. Why is that? Some scientists are of the opinion that cause and effect both exist simultaneously in reality, like the beginning and the end of a word, and man and nature, due to entropy, go through both simultaneously existing states in an order like reading a word following the definition always starts with the state of absolute order and approaches the state of absolute disorder. This path is viewed subjectively as time that actually does not exist in reality, but only exists in the world of each individual. Would you like a little example? Let's look at cause and effect like two railway stations. If the passenger gets on the train station cause and wants to drive according to the effect, does the effect only exist when the passenger has arrived there? At least not according to Christopher Nolan's definition, because in this film we have two passengers and at which station they board the train should be clear. Who now asks, where is the known time? That's the train itself and there are a lot of trains in this film.Since the term time and the associated direction always relates to the individual, the entropy is thus an individual-related direction, like a ticket that an individual purchases at birth. But what happens now when every individual and every object can determine the direction of the entropy themselves, as if reality were a travel agency? This brings us to the content of the film and it really adds up, so that you have to watch the film several times in order to find your own personal direction in the film.Basically, the plot feels like a James Bond offshoot. You start with a terrorist attack in Kiev. The CIA tries to prevent this attack with a secret operation and as luck would have it, the Afro-American James Bond in the form of the protagonist is already there to get in the mood. Now you have to know what protagonist means, because this also makes the role of Kenneth Branagh clear. A protagonist is the ""first to act"" and to this there is a particle connected with him. These two spatially separated particles can exchange information about their properties instantaneously (i.e. without a time delay). The name of this particle is the antagonist. So the protagonist and antagonist are also connected to each other and if one goes around to the right, the other immediately goes around to the left. The two main characters in the film are now also defined and the James Bond offshoot could actually begin now, were it not for the entropy between the train stations cause and effect.Right at the beginning the viewer is drawn into the vortex of physical terms and he will find that the passage of time and the associated entropy is no longer the same here. Our protagonist finds parts where the cause is the result of the effect. What applies to small parts of the microcosm also applies to large parts up to and including a nuclear war in the future. The protagonist is at the cause of the conflict and wants to prevent the effect of the nuclear war, while our antagonist Andrei Sator is at the effect and moves back in time to ensure the cause in order to secure his right to exist.But how do two protagonists / antagonists fight each other who move in exactly different directions within the entropy? This is where our quantum physicist Christopher Nolan comes into play and now lets the atomic particles of reality loose on the viewer. There are no three storylines of the past, the present and the future, because all three states are always present in the film at the same time and they interact in almost every scene in the same reality until the viewer no longer knows which train he is currently on and what the destination station is. It should also be clear that writing a review for this film should actually not be possible according to the film definition, because a review has a beginning and an end. Even the film review would have to be written in such a way that one would have to read it from both sides and still come to the same conclusion, namely the plot of the film.Conclusion:
This film is a quantum physical journey between the train stations of the past, present and future and the viewer sits in front of the film's railway lines and is allowed to deliberately think about which train he is currently seeing and which passengers are now sitting on which train, because it gets even more absurd The passengers also switch trains in this Nolan reality between the past, present and future stations and also interact with each other according to the cause and effect principle. I wish the viewer a lot of fun looking for the next train connection."
"Review of Tenet : Trying to take my bias opinion away from my critical, logical opinion. Few people comprehend the immense detail with the story, I don't even comprehend all of it, but now I understand enough to believe that this is Nolan's most elaborate story yet. This is a complicated movie, and complicated in a good way. If you (as an audience) don't enjoy or understand this movie I understand why and I don't blame you, but on the contrary if you do enjoy this movie, if you understand the story, then I understand why you may believe this to be one of the most intelligent films of all time. (BOLD claim). We already knew what to expect with the quality of cinematography, visual, score, and even to a certain extent, the wild plot that Christopher Nolan ALWAYS delivers because he's consistent with all his films. What we received with this film though, was simply unexpected. This wasn't a film like the dark knight which provides authenticity to a sci-fi world, or even inception which provided clarity after simple attention. This is a film that is intended to be searched, discovered, thought of, looked at, and inspected in every way possible. And yet, this a film intended to give no easy answers, no simple clarity, no instant gratification. This is a film that wants to defy the odds of films by building curiosity over time rather than losing it. Overall I have a lot to discover, a lot to learn, and a lot to understand from this film, yet I'm extremely pleased with its performance in most categories a film has to offer."
"Review of Tenet : If you want to enjoy an intriguing and interesting film which does tribute to many genres and film-making techniques, then TENET is a great choice.My IMAX experience:
A bit of a headache at start but 20min later the headache gets bigger. About 1 hour in the film, it turns into a migraine. And about 1h 45m in, the head explodes!So... I had to go again and watch it.The 2nd time was very rewarding. No headache and i could see through many details and respect the effort making this film.Overall, this is an outstanding filmmaking effort by Nolan and Co. There is almost no green screen mambo-jumbo, real stunts are a fact and you can enjoy a plot which will keep you thinking what the hell is happening at 50% of the film. Rewatching is also fun; I had the pleasure to watch it in IMAX twice (it's all shot in IMAX cameras btw).Kudos to the score, it really coated the action and the entire film in a fantastic way, keeping pace at all times.I don't think I have seen something similar before in terms of non-linear filmmaking and although I was very confused at start, I got into it halfway through and that was very rewarding.Now I guess many of you are still confused.I was too. But once you figure it out, it all makes sense. Except some nonsense.9/10, good solid film."
"Review of Tenet : As this will be non-spoiler, I can't say too much about the story. However, what I can is this: Tenet's story is quite dynamic in the sense that you won't understand it till it wants you to. So, for the first half, your brain is fighting for hints and pieces to puzzle together the story. It isn't until halfway through the movie that Tenet invites you to the fantastic storytelling by Christopher Nolan.Acting is beyond phenomenal, and I'd be genuinely surprised if neither Robert Pattinson nor John David Washington doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for best actor. It's also hard not to mention how good Elizabeth Debicki and Aaron Johnson both are. All around, great acting, and the dialogue amps up the quality of the movie.The idea of this movie is damn fascinating, and while there are films that explore time-travelling, there's never been anything quite like this. It has such a beautiful charm and for the most part, explains everything thoroughly. It feels so much more complex than any form of time-travelling we've seen, and no less could've been expected from Nolan.Oh my lord, the score for this film fits so perfectly. Every scene that's meant to feel intense was amped by a hundred because of how good the score was. Let me just say though, none of them will be found iconic, but they fit the story and scenes so well.In the end, I walked out, feeling very satisfied. Nevertheless, I do have issues with the film that I cannot really express without spoiling bits of the story. There are definitely little inconsistencies that I found myself uncovering as the story progressed. However, I only had one issue that I found impacted my enjoyment. That issue was understanding some of the dialogue. No, not in the sense that the movie is too complicated, but more that it was hard to make out was being said at times. It felt like the movie required subtitles, but that probably was because, at a time in the film, there was far too much exposition.Nevertheless, I loved this film, I'll be watching it at least two more times, and I think most of you in this group will enjoy it. I definitely suggest watching it in theatres if possible, just so you can get that excitement.(4/5) & (8.5/10) for those that care about number scores."
"Review of Tenet : If you can, get to a cinema and watch Tenet.If you can, watch it in IMAX.If you can, watch it twice.The film takes reality and plays it backwards and forwards at the same time. A mind bending, action packed experience like never seen in cinema before."
"Review of Tenet : The thing that I love about Nolan, is that he seemingly does his best to totally disregard the QC checklist of a movie. Personally, personally I loved the artistry of the movie. I wish I could go in depth without sounding like I'm whining on his behalf but here we go.I asked myself the questions
1. Does Christopher Nolan know how to ensure that vocals and language are clear in a film? Yes, he's done it before, it's a hallmark of his work.2. Does he know how to develop characters such that the audience knows and relates to the protagonist? Adding; such that we also can predict to varying degrees plot reveals? Yes he can, he's done it countless times.3. Does he know how to prepare the minds of the audience for the plot that is to come? Yes....must I repeat?So if an accomplished Director ""drops the ball"" in any many of these areas, do we call it a bad film, overly clever...or do we not assume intention perhaps?I'll agree Nolan's films aren't for everyone and some people will hate it, they are allowed to. Personally I see his supposed disregard for fundamentals as a fresh approach to story telling. I can always expect a niche experience. All the ""flaws"" of this movie felt very premeditated. I mean this was a movie of two melding time runs. So of course he experimented the HELL out of the pacing, how much we knew and when we knew it. Nolan's movie accomplishes one thing every time, they let you FEEL what it must be like to be in the film. Not knowing and understanding is kinda the point of the film, right? When we finally get told the effect that making that directional switch has, we understand that vision hearing and understanding are blurred. So when WE can't get the details at times doesn't that make you feel like you also made that switch? Should we be surprised that he attempted to give us that experience? In fact weren't we all watching this in reverse? The fact that it all made perfect sense gradually as the movie went on whilst ""missing"" dialogue is proof in my book of his intentions! Controlling the experience like Nolan does is something I'm not sure we're already for.Boiled down therefore, what Christopher Nolan did was read us two bed time stories simultaneously, one in reverse word after word...That is artistry in my books. Writing and Directorial prowess. Captivating! It felt wholly original. Mind you, he is a psychopath for even attempting this, but I love it. More please."
"Review of Tenet : It really confused me when I watched it yesterday. I can honestly say that I probably missed lots of details even though it came around in the end and settled nicely.
I am sure that people who dive into the details will find these bits and pieces and time will help to digest the whole story.
No matter you hate it or love it but you have to admit that the movies from Nolan are simply so innovative which the current movie industry simply cannot reproduce. He writes the story itself, he directs, chooses the actors, the locations and he mainly uses real world setups instead of computer generated ones. He is so creative and luckily does have the financial background to complete his plans.
I think the main flaw of this movie that the viewer can feel unsatisfied at the end due to the complex setup and this brutal backwards mechanics."
"Review of Tenet : Tenet is the latest Christopher Nolan film starring John David Washington, Elizabeth debicki, Robert Pattinson and keneneth Branagh.
I can't and I don't know how to explain the story. it's a movie that you have to watch it at least twice and I'm going to rewatch it this week. All I can tell you is this is an awesome well made spy/sci-fi movie that you've never seen. Just watch the trailer and go to your local theater.
The first thing that got my attention into the movie was the music oh my god! The music score of this film is incredible. It's an instance film every action moment is instance! but as soon as music starts you're into the movie and this time ludwig goranssson did the soundtrack who also did black panther and won an Oscar for that and also did a few more movies soundtrack and this was his best one imo. The casting choice and acting is great but the Characterizations is a little bit weak not just this film almost the most of the Christopher Nolan films characters I don't care about them Me and the most of the audiences mostly care about the storyline and the things are happening during the movie. Most of his characters are like video games characters and the audiences are the gamers so to watch and understand his movies you have to use your brain as your gaming controller imo. I love the fact that Nolan always avoid green screen and try to use practical effects and that makes the cast performances and action scenes 100 times better and real. And that's why this was by far my best cinematic experience in a movie theater I felt like I was in the movie. Overall it's an awesome well made film that is totally worth watching and paying in cinemas even twice! It's complicating it's crazy and that was everything I wanted from a Nolan film even more what I was expecting! This is one of his best works for the past decade and also one of the best movies of 2020 and this decade. I liked this more than inception. My score for tenet will be a 9/10 for now I may change my mind after second or multiple viewing."
"Review of Tenet : It is complicated and can be hard to hear and/or understand all of the dialogue, which can be an issue when trying to absorb all of the crazy ideas included in this story, as well as connect to the characters. That's my only reason for not giving it 10 stars!You do have to pay attention to everything and even then you'd probably have to watch this one a few times to get all of what it has to offer.I loved the visuals and the score and music throughout. The idea was ambitious which I always appreciate. Robert Patterson and Kenneth Branagh were fantastic in their roles."
"Review of Tenet : When I watched it the first time, I couldn't get it as it is too complicated. If you also watch this for the first time, I recommend you just sit and enjoy the visual - and leave a hundred questions behind.You need to draw the timelines forward and backward for each charactor to understand what/why something happens at a certain time.I watched it 4-5 times on Blu-ray (with pause, reserse, forward) until I finally got the whole picture.When you get how the story plays, watch it from the beginning until the end. That will blow your mind once again!This definitely is a master piece. Unfortunately, I don't think there is a better way to tell the story in 3 hours, and make you understand in one run.So if you want to really understand the story, be prepared to spend a whole day before you start."
"Review of Tenet : At first, I want to ask Christopher Nolan one question, HOW THE HELL YOU DID THIS?
Seriously I want to have an answer, How did he write such as this masterpiece!
How did he get this complicated, fabulous and creative idea? What is going on in his mind?
The story is written and directed perfectly, the narration style was absolutely unique.
I have no idea how can anyone direct such as this story, that was a huge challenge, and as usual Nolan gave us a masterpiece that we'll put beside (Memento), (Inception) and (Interstellar)
The movie is so fast-paced in a good way, there was no boring moment.
The chemistry between John David Washington and Robert Pattinson was great and funny and both of their performance was really good.
Elizabeth Debicki performance was the best in the movie because she had the chance to show her acting abilities and she cached up that chance and showed us an A level acting.The music wasn't unique and distinct as the music of Interstellar for example and I think this movie needed the touch of Hans Zimmer, I'm not saying that Ludwig Göransson failed but Hans Zimmer in another level.If there was something I'd say that I didn't like it in the movie would it be that Nolan discarded any set up or characters backgrounds except Elizabeth Debicki dramatic story but it wasn't that bad for me, I didn't care about that, the exciting story didn't give me the chance to focus on it.
But the actual problem was the third act, it was really complicated and I got lost and I convinced myself to discard the questions that were in my head and enjoy the well-made action sequences and Elizabeth Debicki performance.I think this kind of movie that gets better with a second and third watch."
"Review of Tenet : This movie is exceptionally good. It is one of those titles that is just at another level than most movies. It is however, really complicated. Things go fast and there is quite some philosophical thought experiments throughout. I can see how the movie goes straight over the head of most people. I don't say that out of arrogance, because I experienced this myself. The first time I watched this movie I was able to keep up and it was an amazing experience. I decided to watch it again to fully grasp what is going on, and funny enough, the second time around it went too fast for me. I couldn't connect the dots in a way that I truly understood it, and that made the experience a lot less enjoyable. This is also testament to how complicated this movie is: a second viewing still doens't guarantee a solid grasp on the story.I do beleive that when rating a movie here I should focus on what the movie can bring. I would strongly recommend people to watch it again if they didn't like it the first time, and perhaps even a third time. Pretty weird to recommend people to watch a movie they didn't like several times, but its the only way to truly know if you like it or not.Anyway, no spoilers, but this movie is brilliant."
"Review of Tenet : 'TENET'.
What does it mean?
Chris Nolan sharps up a complex,intriguing vision...and goes deeper within the inversion of matter and time. From a filmmaking standpoint,the film is flawless. It's massive and brilliantly written. It is surely,a piece for the times. The best of the best."
"Review of Tenet : While the rest of the world is at its knees, Australia is doing well enough to have half compacity cinemas, which means I get the pleasure of watching Tenet a week before most of the world.As a self-confessed fanboy of Nolan and his films I came into the cinema busting at the seems with excitement and expectation, I was not let down in the slightest.Tenet's first half has the viewer scrambling their brains trying to comprehend what is happening, from exotic scene to the next your senses are bombarded left and right. It isn't until the second half of the film that it all becomes clear and you understand the true brilliance of what Nolan and his crew have put to the screen.Its hard to keep this review spoiler free because everything about the plot has been hidden and so little has been shown in trailers. While I am not claiming this is the greatest film ever made it certainly is an adequate distraction from the current situation the human race finds itself in.I highly recommend viewing this film in theatres at least once, (even though it will probably take you 2 or 3 viewings to fully grasp all the intricacies like it has for me); I feel like the full experience will be missed if your first viewing is at home like many Nolan films before it.KidKuubrick."
"Review of Tenet : While I am always trying to be objective when watching a movie, I find myself captivated by Nolan's Movies as soon as the first scene starts. Here is a director that does not compromise his ideas and expresses love for the cinematic experience with every frame.Tenet gives you no time for consideration in the first half, by taking all your attention to the mysterious premise of an unknown foe. In this time even the dullest scenes of remote meetings get interesting and are carried by John David Washington. Compared to Inception (2010), where every part of the strategy was explained to the audience, here there is ample room for interpretation and the tempo is building up to a point where there is no time to try.In the second half, my personal revelation was the transformation of Elizabeth Debicki's Character from a Woman in Distress in need of saving to a determined uncompromising heroine. This highlighted a change in the movie as a whole and increased my respect for Debicki's acting.Even though I was not surprised by every twist towards the end, I was entertained and in awe of the overall experience. I didn't feel overwhelmed by the theories that were introduced and was pleasantly surprised of the execution.I would recommend this movie to everyone who is willing to experience it first, before trying to understand it."
"Review of Tenet : Beautifully done, and they got the time-stuff correct, with only minor contradictions. Or those contradictions may just be me having missed certain details. It went a bit too fast, the names and the context. And it was too loud sometimes."
"Review of Tenet : I'm not going to get into whether it all made sense.... More pertinent, perhaps; rather than feeling like I needed to see it a second time to understand it, I wanted to watch it again simply because I enjoyed it so much. Even if you see it only once, Christopher Nolan is a masterful storyteller and it is admirable that he is willing to try something outside of the typical Hollywood storytelling conventions. I loved Interstellar and Inception, and Memento is a masterpiece; Tenet did not disappoint. Great action sequences, excellent dialogue; in my mind, definitely one of the best movies I have seen this year."
Review of Tenet : Excelent piece by Nolan. Lives up to the expectations. Second time even better
"Review of Tenet : Based on the assumption that entropy determines the arrow of time, TENET explores what could happen if entropy could be reversed, or ""Inverted"", for objects, people and even the environment around us. If we are rendering our planet inhabitable due to the excesses, wastefulness and ignorance of our generation and our predecessors, could our descendants want revenge and turn back the winds of time against us and erase our existence in an attempt to save their own?""A nuclear weapon can only affect our future. An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well.""TENET plays with the concepts of causality, free will and paradoxes. The film posits that paradoxes cannot be solved and that their consequences are unknowable. This is juxtaposed with the future's intention of annihilating the past, essentially creating a grandfather paradox. Perhaps, the people in the future have found a way to sidestep the paradox and create a different branch of reality?""Somewhere, sometime, a man in a crystalline tower throws a switch and Armageddon is both triggered and avoided.""In a race to stop the villain - an egotistical, abusive and dying man - from transmitting the location of ""The Algorithm"" - a device that can invert the entropy of our environment - to the people in future, the film takes its characters through multiple mind-bending sequences resulting from the puzzling implications of Inversion. The film takes some artistic license in depicting the consequences of inversion and treats the audience with several massive set pieces - unique in parts, accompanied by an intense score to spectacular effect.""That part is a little dramatic.""With the global threat averted, TENET ends on a melancholic note as the friendship at the heart of the film comes to an end (and also begins), loose ends are tied up and the world remains unaware of what could have happened.""No one cares about the bomb that didn't go off. Only the ones that did...""Although TENET packs too much plot for a two and a half hour film where everything cannot possibly be explained or understood by the audience on first viewing and it is easy to get lost into the intricacies of the mechanics of inversion, it is, nonetheless, a cinematic tour de force and a bold attempt at large scale, ambitious storytelling with a palindromic structure. Something we could use more of, for us and for our posterity."
"Review of Tenet : Firstly, on an IMAX screen this movie looks incredible and the sound is powerful. The action sequences with reverse entropy are groundbreaking and work into the fabric of the story and action really well. The thought of people running backwards sounds 'silly' however Nolan pulls it off effortlessly, the first scene we see this done really grips you into the movie and from that point on you are locked in for a great ride.As always Nolan has a complex story which in many ways like inception and memento leaves the audience to fill in some of the very strategically left blanks, which will keep you thinking long after the movie has finished. He gives his audience enough respect not to turn this movie into a science lesson which allows plenty of room for action.Overall this is a very smart, stylish action packed movie with a detailed story that delivers superb cinema."
"Review of Tenet : Really enjoy Nolan's films and understood he likes non-linear storytelling. I gave 9/10 and not 10/10 because maybe a tad bit too far this time. However, lots of oh yeah moments, tremendous action, great acting and in the end, the writer ties it all together albeit with a few head scratches. Still great experience and loved being back in a theater."
"Review of Tenet : Once again Christopher Nolan has managed to create a brilliant piece of art by bending the laws of physics and cinema to provide the audience with an immense and thrilling experience. The action and excitement which is present throughout the film keeps your adrenaline pumping, whilst the intricacy of the plot and time itself keeps your mind engaged and constantly questioning what has just happened.
It is an amazing film and like many others of Nolan's creation, is highly rewarding as the audience gets the pleasure of piecing together all of the clues presented to them - both those hidden and those in plain sight.
This film is a must-see and I highly recommend that you watch it if you're looking to escape reality in such sad times."
Review of Tenet : This movie very hard to follow. The beginning is very vague and that is why its difficult to understand the point of the story. But if you get threw all that you see one hell of a movie with plot twists and little hidden throwbacks to tie up the story.
"Review of Tenet : Excellent movie, concept story and everything as great, only reason that its getting a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the sound in the cinema, too loud and unpleasent at times, also the talking was slightly muddled at certain spots in my opinion, otherwise great movie"
"Review of Tenet : Loved! It!
Yes It's complicated.. yes, you have to stay focused to understand it... but man oh man, does this movie deliver!
I want to see it again, and again and perhaps even again..
Great actors. Intense music. Breathtaking locations..
It made me want to stand up and applause.
Masterpiece!"
"Review of Tenet : What's with all the hates on this movie? I thought it was a great film and understood it after the first viewing. Very ambitious concept for a movie! Here is a trick, put down your cellphone and pay attention. I agree that it is complex but you just need to pay attention or it will be very confusing. If you miss 2 minutes of the movie, you'll be lost (keep your eyes on the screen). Dialogue only becomes an issue when they were wearing the masks. But hey, no one understands what I say when I go to the store wearing a mask during COVID-19 (reality I guess). Robert did an amazing job in a very mysterious character. John-David is awesome as the lead and keeps reminding me of his dad, not sure this is a good thing (got big shoes to fill). Overall John David did really well and learning that he did most of his stunts was an added bonus. My first like-able Nolan female character (she can act). The end of the movie was a bit sad ""but it's only the beginning of a beautiful friendship"". I am going with 9/10 only because I wanted more actions. The inverted action sequences were well done. Great attention to details!"
"Review of Tenet : I'm not gonna lie, first viewing was a big letdown. As a Nolan fan myself, I was shocked to see what I considered ""annoying bad"" writing and sound design. The sound design still is a problem as of writing this, but upon second viewing, it was like a little switch flicked on every time I saw something I didn't understand from the last viewing. The little details that I considered bad writing suddenly seemed like an obvious answer. The cheesy parts I thought were, well cheesy, had so much more depth. I'm not going to spoil it, but thinking about The Protagonist and Neil makes me feel so many emotions that upon second viewing never made me feel the way I did, truly beautiful. No movie is perfect, this one definitely isn't perfect. This is no Dunkirk or Inception, but I guarantee this movie will make you use your brain."
"Review of Tenet : I've seen a lot of hate for Tenet, but I honestly believe the movie will age very well, and a lot of the people who hate it now will come to realize just how ahead of its time it is. I will admit that it prioritizes concept over plot and character, and hard-to-hear dialogue has become a recurring problem for Nolan. But the movie is great, and I like it more the more I think about it. You don't need to be super smart to understand it, as some diehard Nolan fans claim, but I believe you do need to be fascinated enough by the philosophy of time to make it a pleasant experience. Without that, I think the movie will bore you and that boredom will probably lead you to miss some key points needed to fill in the puzzle. Filling in the puzzle doesn't mean you'll like it though, because this movie is an experimental thriller disguised as a blockbuster, which is not what people expected.Hey, maybe I'm wrong, but I expect the love for this movie will grow over the years."
"Review of Tenet : I have a huge amount of respect for director Christopher Nolan. His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.Among Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.In the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.So the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.For the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.So there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing."
"Review of Tenet : So, after coming back from the cinema from watching Tenet for the first time, I was feeling such a buzz but at the same time if somebody had asked me (which they did..) what was it about, I would have just had to answer: no idea. Second time watching, it was so much clearer. The time inversion, going backwards and forwards makes sense and is logical. In fact, it's very cleverly thought out. Christopher Nolan does it again in that he makes something that just should not work actually make sense. You just have to give it time. And preferably watch it with subtitles. Just like a lot of his films, not only does it makes you want to talk about it, think up theories but it's also a great cinema experience.As for the rest of it, again typical Nolan. The music was so effective, it made me jump up in my seat with the tension of it along with the great directing. There were a lot of great shots (I mean seriously, wow), very spectacular scenes and the cinematography was on point. The acting was good even though it was less about the characters and more an ensemble piece/plot driven. Despite people having problems with the muffled dialogue, it personally didn't affect me.All in all, I would definitely recommend people to watch this film; the first watch for the amazing look and thrill of it and the second watch for the clever plot.Very good 8/10"
"Review of Tenet : Great movie, very fast paced and you need to keep up! Loved it."
"Review of Tenet : An intriguing, fast-paced, and creative spy thriller. It has an interesting concept for you to wrap your brain around that kept my brain stimulated for the duration. I saw a lot of people say they thought it was overly convoluted, but it felt fine to me (although those I watched it with disagree). Maybe my advantage going into it was I could hear the dialogue alright (many complained about the audio mixing) and I could keep up with everything going on in the film for the most part. But, I also could be missing much of it while not even realizing it. It's hard to know, because analyzing one aspect of the movie requires you to wrap your brain around the entire thing at once. I also saw some complaining about the exposition, but it was definitely necessary and it flowed fine for me.While still a solid movie, I think it would have been better with more fledged out characters. The only character we really got an in-depth look into was Kat. The rest of them were written generally the same as most protagonists and I feel the film could have benefited more from their persons being explored. Also, while the movie was fast-paced and action scenes were fun and innovative, I felt the urge for more gritty, brutal fight scenes rather than the many times we were given simple headlocks. While holes (or the opposite: more aspects coming to light) could become apparent to me on a rewatch, for now this sits in my mind as a solid action film. Certainly not Nolan's best, but certainly more unique and captivating than most blockbusters.7.6/10"
"Review of Tenet : An unexpected work from Christopher Nolan
Well Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly one of the best directors, but Tenet is a big problem!
At first I'm not even sure how to write a review about this movie! Complex, strange and annoying at times, and I cannot even tell if the scenario is smart or is it just complicated?
On the positive side, the acting was perfect, especially in terms of Robert. And his acting is perfect. This is clearly his best movie ever.
There are other features such as music, photography, etc. However, the movie does not match the rest of the great Nolan films, but it is not bad so I will rate it 8 out of 10."
"Review of Tenet : ______________________________________________________The Protagonist : "" This reversing { of } the flow of time, does us being here now, mean it { - Never - }... happened ? "" .
Plunging "" Headfirst 🎯 "" into the Action from the very ~{ GET GO }~ , Tenet is in ~{ No Way }~ lacking in that proverbial, age old, & ever cherished ""thrills-and-spills"" Department. The actors ( R-Patz, Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh, Dimple Kapadia ) were all 'generally' well cast, with the choice of John David Washington 🌠 in the Lead-Role as ' The { Fresh-faced, new } Protagonist ', resonating in a very Obvious & Powerful { 🔥 } way, in this era of ' Hashtag-B.l.m ' ( etc. )... whether that was by design, or whether it wasn't .
Having-Said-That : The dialogue in that thoroughly action-""Drenched"" first scene of the film, which I just jubilantly hinted at above, is also for the Most Part, quite unfortunately, ... "" Almost - Entirely - Unintelligible "" ..I'm Afraid . { Nb } : This is in part due to the fact that most ( if not all ) the primary characters in that scene are -actually- wearing Swat Style gas masks during their performances for pretty much what turned out to be almost the -Entire- scene { ..filmed at the -Fittingly- beautiful and atmospheric Estonia Concert Hall in Linnahall, Tallinn } .
This aspect of the production { namely : the "" Profound "" inability to comprehend ( ~ A Lot ~ ) of what is being said by nearly ( ~ All ~ ) of the Lead-characters in the picture at Many, Many, Many, Many, Many points in the film }, is what eventually turns out to be its unequivocal, & 'enduring' .....( Even ).....

Therefore, this very unique 'Special-Feature' of Tenet makes the need to understand, very literally ~{ every single word }~ of dialogue in the movie extremely well.... of paramount importance.

"Review of Tenet : NO SPOILERS QUICK REVIEW: Originally I would have scored this film a 7 out of 10 after my first watch, but upon rewatch I've began to love this film, finding it very fluent and intriguing as a blockbuster story. I must also compliment on the film's technical areas the score, effects, sound, cinematography etc. as they are very unique and masterful all around.Also I'd like to praise all of the cast on giving their full effort for Nolan once again especially John David Washington in the lead role. Personally I believe this film will age like fine wine and it will be treasured for years to come."
"Review of Tenet : What a masterpiece. I have never been this excited after watching a movie, even after watching Endgame does not make me feel this kind of excitement. Sorry Marvel. I am speechless after the movie. It feels so satisfying.
If you can, find the biggest cinema screen that have the loudest speaker (Ludwig Goransson you are the best) in your area to watch this movie. You can thank me later. Seriously, go and watch it."
"Review of Tenet : The first part of the movie was relatively easy to grasp what was going on, with me being able to keep up fairly well with how the story was unfolding.However, an hour in or so and the story started to really accellerate with a pace I couldn't keep up with. I could not process every bit that was going on any longer, leading to further questions raised in my head the longer the movie continued.In the last part of the movie, some questions got answered and started to make sense, but still the vast majority of questions and uncertainties remained.All in all, I definitely need to watch the movie another couple of times to try and grasp certain passages I simply couldn't after watching it the first time."
"Review of Tenet : After a long wait, it is worth it. It has great scenes with great music that makes it even more impressive. But I missed Hans Zimmer. Great performance of John David Washington, till today I didn't know him :D"
"Review of Tenet : The Nolan team don't skimp on the 'epic'ery of their films (although they may have to after the pandemic eats into the box office of this one).
It's not just a movie, it IS cinema.
It's like one, long advertisement for the new techno-fad of temporal flipping. They go about it as casually as a young technology sales person explaining the latest smartphone to you. You only kind of understand what they're saying but what they're SHOWING you is so cool you just go along with it.
It is a good film to help understand TIME as potentially the next great expanse to be explored.
There's a scene in Avengers: Endgame where they belittle concepts of time presented in Back To The Future and almost every other time-related sci-fi movie. Well, TeneT makes Endgame's own concept of time travel seem rudimentary.
Unique & interesting characters from John David Washington (3 names so gotta be good), Pattinson, Debicki, Brannagh & more!
Some of the most bizarre action sequences to ever unoccur on film.
Good."
Review of Tenet : Confused while watching it but with time to think about it afterwards it makes sense
Review of Tenet : This film is so so so great everything is good i love so much robert patinson in christor nolan i love the action in this movie and the writing is so so so much great i really need see this again
"Review of Tenet : This is the first film in a while where I'm going to watch it a second time, partly because I enjoyed it first time round, but primarily because I wanted to understand it better.It's a very, very good film, I enjoy complex, Tenet takes complex to a whole new level. Great if you have the ability to concentrate, frustrating I would imagine for a casual viewer, I heard several people moaning they hadn't a clue what they'd just watched.I found it rather exciting, and very entertaining, I'm not sure if it was the cinema I was in, but the sound wasn't exactly perfect, the music seemed to overpower the dialogue.Robert Pattinson, my heart sank when I heard he was going to play Batman, however, after watching this, I'm now convinced he'll do a great job, he was terrific in this.Don't be surprised if you want a second viewing for clarity, well worth it, excellent movie. 8/10."
"Review of Tenet : The movie is pretty convoluted and a bit hard to follow on a first watch. It will eventually click about halfway through the movie but its a better experience watching the movie once you have the knowledge from the first playthrough. Not Christopher Nolan's best work, but solid movie nonetheless. I feel like the protagonist wasn't very likable. Robert's character was the highlight of the movie."
"Review of Tenet : Early in the film one of the characters says: Don't try and make sense of it, just feel it. So that's what i did, and thankfully so. If you see this movie for the first time, and you try and make complete sense of the plot without having a doctors degree in astrophysics, your head will probably hurt. Your first viewing should be to just pay attention, and let the movie guide you forward (or backwards), don't try and put all the pieces together, because you can't. This is Nolan doing what he does best, which is manipulating time.It's a complex new film from Nolan, which previously has played with time in several of his films, but in different ways every time. From Different speeds in Inception and Interstellar to different time windows in which a story unfolds in Dunkirk, and the back and forth in Memento, Nolan seems to be obsessed with time. And by sticking to his guns as he calls it, he manages to make movies that looks like nothing before it. This is yet again, a movie only Nolan could have made.What i truly liked about this film is how Nolan from the very beginning show us hints about what's to come, but we don't yet know it. But when these small hints and sequences are finally revealed as the plot moves along, it's incredibly rewarding. It proves that he is a master of manipulation, which is a skill he truly needed to make this film, and movies like The Prestige. I'm not going to go into specifics how time works in this film, but it's a new take, from the trailers you already know it has something to with time inversion. Time that is moving backwards.For decades scientists have been discussing time, and how it works. For us humans, time moves forward. But does that mean it does that for everyone, or every thing? No. In quantum physics, there is no time, things move in all directions, and we humans are made up of atoms, which then does not move in one direction. But yet, we feel it that way.This movie's plot is anchored in these laws of quantum physics. Just like Nolan also used laws of physics in Interstellar for example, to describe how a spinning black hole can slow time so much that 1 hour close to it, equaled many many years on Earth. So even if Tenet for many people, won't make any sense, just see the movie for the first time with an open mind.If you can just enjoy the spectacular action sequences, the constant tension, the pounding music and the beautiful cinematography, this movie delivers pure and solid entertainment.I tried to put myself in Nolan's shoes after i saw this film. I thought to myself, if i had come up with this story, i would likely have doubted myself on every turn, because i could not let go, the amount of ifs and buts would explode my cranium.But I felt i understood the time trickery quite well in this film, and i enjoyed the entertainment for what it was, and i think it's one of the best action films, probably the best so far, this year. But i also felt like this movie was missing something, it might be a lack of character development, in which this movie has almost none. It might also be that i took a close look at some of the scenes closer to the climax, which was without doubt very difficult to coordinate and film, but i saw several mistakes.But all in all, what a spectacular film. Nolan is the only one in the industry that can make a film like this. It's just a bit sad he values plot and action more than connection with the characters, in which this movie needed a little bit more.8/10"
"Review of Tenet : It was long yet I enjoyed every moment. But truth be known, I found the concepts a little hard to piece together. I suspect that is because at times it was very difficult to hear. The opening scene is loud and most people are wearing gas masks. And from there On, there are many times where it's hard to hear the dialogue over the other sounds. Maybe it was the cinema mix. Anyway, still enjoyed it immensely. Great stunts and locations, 9/10 acting, like the sci-fi concepts. More adventure than sci-go though, just FYI. Worth the time and money."
"Review of Tenet : Honestly a great movie, would most definitely recommend watching it in IMAX"
"Review of Tenet : This is still my least favorite Nolan's film. Yeah! I said it.
(Well, excluding Dark Knight Rises which I don't even consider a Nolan film to be completely honest, that's like a Michael Bay film in my eyes, no offense).I absolutely love their work (yes, ""their"", I'm giving credit to Johnathan too)
If you ask me about my favorite top 10 movies of all time,
3 of them are Nolan's (The Prestige, Inception, Memento) - which means a lot,
and if you ask me about my top 20 - Dark Knight and Interstellar will be on that list too, so that's 5 Nolan movies in my top 20, OF ALL TIME.
That's 25% of the list.Anyways, your intelligence has nothing to do with it, don't worry, Tenet simply requires a 2nd watch, as in, it's literally a must.Having said that, although the 2nd watch did make me like the movie more, and I do believe I understand the concept well and the complexity behind it, including some little details I have noticed and missed on my 1st watch -
This is still not even close to that top 20 list.The ride is fun, but even on the 2nd watch you don't know where you're riding to and why and that's due to the lack of ->
a better backstory, better character development and better dialogs -
because it's like all of their mind went into polishing the concept itself,
leaving all of the abovementioned aspects behind.I gave it a generous 7/10 for the idea behind the film and because I cannot say it wasn't entertaining, it's just not on par with most of their other work.Edit: Also I have to say, Ludwig's score was top-notch, BUT, there were moments where the music was literally too cool for the scene. As in, ""nothing spectacular happened that moment, why is the score so good and intense right now?"". I know it's a silly statement but that's my opinion, it was just off-putting."
"Review of Tenet : I love an intellectual challenge. Seems like some of the poor ratings struggle with that part. That said, Tenet was unnecessarily complicated at times. I don't need explanations handed to me (I hate when films do that), but I almost got the feeling the intent of those really complex plot/action scenes was specifically to confuse/disorient me. If that's true, kind of brilliant. If not, they were just trying a little too hard.Pace, action, effects... it was just fun to watch and kept me engaged. Having to frequently ""keep up"" with what's going on was a little frustrating at time... like the feeling of wanting to stop and scroll back but not wanting to break the action. Again, intentional? The opening concert scene was kind of overdone, maybe a little gimmicky, or the director wasn't quite sure what to do there. How about this analogy... like two lovers fumbling around in the back seat of a car for the first time. Pretty fun but kind of unsure, clumsy.The lead actors were really good. I really liked Washington's cool confidence but I sometimes got this sense that he was holding back his own personality to fit a part. I hope that make sense. I've really enjoyed watching Pattinson mature as an actor. Maybe felt like he was a better actor than the role presented. Not his fault on that though.I'll need to watch this a few more times. Kind of like the first time watching the film Inception, but even that was easier to follow. If a film makes it into my multiple-watch list, that's pretty high praise."
"Review of Tenet : I am a big fan of Nolan, but it is just too much to handle in one movie"
"Review of Tenet : Just watched for the second time, on tv. The balance between the voices and all the other sounds, especially the music, is appalling. This certainly does not help anyone to understand what is going on.It is visually impressive and contains exciting action sequences. The relationshipsbetween the characters could be described as ""British reserved"".It deserves a rewatch or two, helped by a reading of the clues that others have written about.It does not suffer from black screen time as some modern movies do, but, like too many, the sound balance and clarity of vocals is sub par, hence the drop to eight stars."
"Review of Tenet : If you have had the luxury of going to the theaters or you are planning on watching Tenet this review will give you an idea of what to expect. I will not try to give any spoilers that are not in the trailer. To begin, the plot of Tenet is fairly complex. The Protagonist is apart of the CIA, he ""dies"" on a mission and is sent on a mission to save the world. The future and the past coincide and it's his job to find out what is happening and put an end to it. IF you thought Inception was difficult to follow you are in for a doozy. In fact, I would go so far as to say that unless you are able to easily follow what happened in Inception, please don't watch this as your head may explode. They are by no means comparable in terms of plot; however, as someone who just watched Tenet for a second time, there are still several information gaps I don't fully understand. That being said if you have great focus and love to investigate, you love brain games and confusion, I would thoroughly recommend this as it will take you into a wild ride. IF however, you are the average viewer looking to spend a day/an evening ""unplugging"" or enjoying sane writing do yourself a favor and avoid this one. I intend to watch this movie likely two more times, but not until it comes out on DVD/Online. Subtitles are very important here as, with all of Christopher Nolan's films, the writing is essential to understanding what is happening in the film and there are two relatively important characters that I was only able to understand 50% of what was said, because of their thick accent and involved wording. Again, this was my second viewing. All told, I would give this film an 8/10. In spite of being extremely difficult to follow and probably intentional holes that I would like to have seen filled, it is still an incredible idea executed well, but not something for everyone to enjoy."
"Review of Tenet : A lot of the audience members of Tenet have complained that Tenet is too confusing to enjoy, and that's what unfortunately makes Tenet so unenjoyable at times for me. I already knew that Tenet was supposed to be confusing when going into the movie, so I tried my best to focus and listen, and yet I still got confused. There's a lot of different timelines going on with mashing sub plots, and the film didn't do a great job at explaining everything. Maybe it's just me, but the film was just really hard to follow. I even watched an explanation video, and that was even confusing. The plot is just really complex, and even though I couldn't really follow it the whole time, I still appreciated it because of how smart and deep it is.Aside from the plot, everything is near perfect. The inverted fight scenes were crazy in the best ways possible. There were times where I was just blown away by some of the scenes, and I questioned how Christopher Nolan filmed it Tenet is the first of its kind, and the fact that Christopher Nolan nailed it, I think he deserves some awards for that.Tenet is a really solid movie. With good performances from the actors, great action scenes, amazing direction, and an extremely complex and mind-blowing plot. Tenet deserves nothing less than a 7/10. And if you're going into this film for the first time, then prepare to awake the sixth sense, because this film will destroy every last brain cell."
"Review of Tenet : On first viewing I will agree with many that the movie is a little difficult to follow . It's a demanding watch on plenty of levels . Where Interstellar and Inception both spent plenty of time throughout the film introducing the science behind it all Tenet ignores it , mostly . They do spell out the concept in a couple of brief scenes but then abandon any science in favour of action .There is plenty of relentless high voltage action if that's your thing and some genuine stunt work was great to see but it all becomes a little pointless if you don't really understand why it's all happening .If you don't like it really loud take some ear plugs . The score is thundering but a little overused for my liking . It is accomplished and brilliant film making but my first impressions were that I just didn't enjoy it as much as some of his previous films . I'll start with a 7 but I believe it has the potential to grow on me . It is a visual treat that's for sure ."
Review of Tenet : I'd suggest people read the synopsis on Wikipedia before watching the time. Otherwise it would be too hard to follow. If you're the type of person who enjoys watching a movie multiple times and dissecting it then you'll enjoy Tenet
"Review of Tenet : Christopher Nolan's latest head-scratching thriller is a far cry from INCEPTION, although as a blockbuster action film in the Bond mould it's fairly enjoyable. But, like DUNKIRK, it manages to be seriously flawed too, and less good than it thinks it is. It suffers hugely from a lead actor who can't actually act; even the Indian kid from EASTENDERS would have been better. Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh and Michael Caine all act Washington off the screen at various points. As for the time travel, it's more like time reversal, and is essentially a MacGuffin which allows the director to incorporate some cool trickery into the otherwise routine action bits. Not bad, but not a film I'll think much about in years to come."
"Review of Tenet : Like many others I felt kind of dumb after watching this movie. And I suspect that is the whole point. Nolan wants to feel smart by writing an incomrehensible story that only he understands. The directing is great in general, although I did get a bit annoyed after a while by the constant jumping between places (if that is part of the directing i dunno whatever). And the name dropping and little tidbits of sciency factoids is kind of silly as well. It could've been much more enjoyable as a simple action movie with a shorter runtime and if one haven't had to pay attention to every second.I realize I might have been too generous with my rating after writing this, lol"
"Review of Tenet : The Protagonist (John David Washington) is a CIA operative. He is captured during an operation in Ukraine. He is able to eat a cyanide pill. He wakes up and gets recruited to fight a new cold war. Someone in the future is using inverted entropy to affect events in the past. He and Neil (Robert Pattinson) start investigating zeroing in on former Russian oligarch, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), and his abused wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki).Christopher Nolan obviously has a thing about time. Memento happens to be one of my favorite films of all time. He is attacking it with all of his filmmaking skills and it is an attack from the editing, the sound mix, the plot, to the structure of the movie. First thing I noticed is that Nolan is relentlessly pushing the pace with every bit of filmmaking. The sound mix is like a heartbeat driving the movie whenever it goes into action mode. The editing is crisp and head-snapping. This is his transport plane deliberately driven into a constructed fake building. He's driving the movie into a fake building and not letting the audience the time to ruminate about the logic of the premise.In the end, that's its biggest flaw. The premise is out there and it's hard to keep track of the plot after the turn. The first part is a movie of one thing after another. When it gets to Kat, it finally tries to establish a connection with the characters. The fun part is the backward action moves but the logic of this premise keeps bugging me. For example, why is he trying to shoot himself in the past? Thinking about it after the fact leaves one with more questions and questions about the questions. The good part is that the relentless great action makes it impossible to dislike. The backwards action is just fun and different. That's plenty good enough."
"Review of Tenet : If you are expecting the adrenaline you got with Inception, look no further. If you are looking to be able to follow this film on the first viewing like you did with Inception, maybe not so much. I would put this film one level higher in complexity than Inception, as Inception was complex but pretty intuitive. This film CAN be intuitive, but unless you want to wait for the Blu Ray, you're going to have to shell out to see it multiple times to actually get a better understanding of the plot's finer points.
A more logistical thing to comment on: it seems the audio mix is lacking. I originally thought it was my theater (voices seem to carry too much bass, making them hard to understand; however, Studio Movie Grill plays this film very, very loud, which I love because it makes the gunfire far more realistic), but others have complained about this as well. I am hoping that the blu ray will be remastered so that this is not an issue.
With all this being said, be patient. This film is great and I have a strong feeling you will not be disappointed. It is classic Nolan doing what he does best. It is intricate, spares no expense, and it is by no means lazy. Once the BR comes out, it may actually turn into one his his best so far."
Review of Tenet : Maybe the concept here is suppose to be great but with muddled dialogues and confusing chaotic story line still can't make sense of this. Some great action for sure.
"Review of Tenet : It's a really good film, however, it's overly complex and the sound mixing is awful, you can't hear half of the dialogue."
"Review of Tenet : This movie is actually not that hard to understand. If you really want to have your mind blown then watch Dark on Netflix it's got three seasons. You're welcome.
Anyway it's very simple. This movie is about two different timelines occurring at the same time. Same people, two different timelines, future and past. The ""present"" timeline is actually not at play here so don't wonder how can the past be the present and how can the future have an effect on the past or present. Again the ""present"" timeline is not at play here in this movie, it never exists. Here comes a SPOILER.... think of the future in past tense as if things have already happened and not as how they ""will"" happen. The Protagonist from the future went back in time to recruit and put everyone and everything in its place in order for things to happen just like they should. The Protagonist is the one pulling all the strings, he's the puppet master but his future self doesn't know it yet, he only realizes it once the mission is done and so he understands it's his responsibility to make sure everything goes according to the plan that worked in the future."
"Review of Tenet : Not as much action in the beginning, the time traveling stuff kinda confused me, I understood it basically but felt like I really had to pay extra attention to this movie, I know I'd probably like it better a second time that's why the rating it so high. The main character has a couple of REALLY bad jokes, that's my main complaint with this movie. The time traveling stuff is cool it just takes a while to get there."
"Review of Tenet : Upon entering the cinema to see this film i had my doubts; previous reviews i'd read did not suggest that this film would be enjoyable upon first time watching. A claim which i believe to be untrue! This film is more understandable than expected throughout many of its parts and does a good job of focusing the viewer's attention on details which are important to the story later on. Whilst a second watch will only further this understanding, I personally feel this is not a necessity. However, this film is a challenge to follow perfectly and I'm sure that most viewers (including myself) will leave questioning certain details. The sound mix is also not as bad as many suggest and is only noticeable in energetic action sequences which may be a choice to immerse the viewer as I'm sure it is hard to hear clear dialogue whilst bullets are flying! If you have the attention span and like a film that challenges your understanding of the world then this is definitely worth a watch!"
"Review of Tenet : The general plot is comprehensible enough to enjoy the movie, try to dig a bit deeper into all the intricacies and you'll probably lose yourself really fast. The movie's premise is actually interesting, but at some points it gets a bit tiring trying to connect all the dots. Nolan's movies tend to think they're smarter then they really are (a big problem I had with interstellar), and this one suffers from the same problem, but 2.5 hours passed relatively fast, I can't say i didn't have fun watching it, however i don't plan on rewatching it."
Review of Tenet : After exercising cerebrum capacity to its maximum extent I'm unsure if this was worth the effort - not the unravelling of the puzzle but what they were trying to save.
Review of Tenet : John David Washington and Robert Pattinson had great chemistry working together! Washington played his role brilliantly!I went from knowing nothing to understanding and then to not knowing. Which is kinda what life is. I enjoyed this philosophical expression of a movie.
"Review of Tenet : I am a massive fan of Christopher Nolan and all his work. This film, for me, was fantastic and everything I would want from a Nolan film. However, my girlfriend was completely confused and could not continue watching as the concepts and issues tackled in the film was so complex and the explanation was patchy at best. Great for movie fans and those who like complex story lines, not great for anyone who wants a casual experience."
"Review of Tenet : I really like Nolan's movies. All of them have been astoundingly good.I like the way he plays with timelines and also I like to come with my own analysis.But with Tenet , it seems like Nolan has deliberately tried to over-complicate a simple (compared to his other) story line.Ofcourse , by intentionally leaving several scenes open-ended + playing around the editing , he has managed to confuse his audience.Perhaps this indeed was his goal and not really to make his ideas clear.Nolan fans will tend to try 'understanding' this story and interpret in their own ways , in an attempt to prove their own intelligence.But story isnt as complicated , as i understand.Here is what I Understood :
All major powers have already discovered the ways of time travel , which they call 'turnstiles'.The inverse technology is already well known and used by Super-Secret government organizations.This screws up the future generations , and they try to find a way to find objects and humans who have been 'inversed'.A scientist discovers a program named 'Tenet' , which basically when activated searches and destroys all 'inversed objects'.Government agencies in future and past , realizing the danger of this program - hunt the scientist and and she breaks the program down
into 9 pieces and hides them.The government agencies then hire protagonist in the past to track and find the program.Meanwhile , rebels in future - who want the problematic future to end for good , recruit Antagonist (Andrei) to collect all pieces of program and execute it.But protagonist , knowing Governments true intentions , has his own plans.The protagonist manages to find the program before it gets executed , takes it apart into three pieces.Result : The timeline is undisturbed , Governments continue to use timemachines and future is doomed.Other characters are introduced intentionally by Nolan to muddle things."
"Review of Tenet : ""Tenet"" is a science-fiction action thriller film directed by Christopher Nolan, who is known for his visually stunning and complex films. The movie follows a protagonist (John David Washington) as he tries to prevent a global catastrophe caused by the inversion of time.The film's opening scene immediately sets the tone for the rest of the movie, with an intense and visually stunning sequence of a terrorist attack in a packed opera house. The scene showcases the film's impressive production design and use of practical effects, which is a hallmark of Nolan's films.As the film progresses, the audience is introduced to the concept of inversion, which is the ability to reverse the flow of time. This concept is both fascinating and confusing, and it takes a while to fully grasp. The film does a decent job of explaining the rules of inversion, but there are still moments where it feels a bit convoluted.The protagonist, who is only referred to as ""The Protagonist,"" is a skilled CIA operative who is recruited by a secret organization called Tenet to stop a Russian oligarch (Kenneth Branagh) from causing a global catastrophe. Washington's performance is excellent, and he is able to convey the necessary gravitas and intensity needed for the role.The supporting cast is also impressive, with Robert Pattinson playing a mysterious and charming operative, Elizabeth Debicki as the estranged wife of the villain, and Branagh as the menacing antagonist. However, the characters are not given a lot of depth, and the audience is never fully invested in their individual journeys.The action scenes in the film are spectacular, with Nolan's signature use of practical effects and practical stunts. The use of inversion adds a unique twist to the action sequences, with characters fighting and driving in reverse. The film's climax, which takes place in an abandoned city, is a visual spectacle and a true testament to Nolan's ability to create stunning set pieces.However, the film's pacing is a bit uneven, with some scenes feeling too long and others feeling rushed. The film's editing, while impressive at times, also contributes to the confusion caused by the inversion concept. There are moments where it feels like the film is trying to be too clever for its own good, and the narrative suffers as a result."
"Review of Tenet : Tenet explores a complex world with a hard-to-understand narrative, and the actors are very good. However, the concept within the film: reversal could have been better exploited. Indeed, with the use of time for the scenario, it's impossible not to have inconsistencies or plot holes. Tenet is no exception, with several scenes in the film contradicting the film itself.But let's look at the positives: there's no use of CGI, the film is authentic, and the cinematography is exceptional. Of course, given that Nolan is the director.Unfortunately, Tenet is not a film I'm likely to see again. 7.1/10."
"Review of Tenet : I have watched this movie a couple times simply because I love it so much. But my favorite part is the music as the music sells the movie. The music keeps you interested in the movie at all times. It is impossible to be bored, especially with all of the incredible action. And if you know anything about the movie it is all about palindromes and the music is a palindrome. Isn't that crazy!!! The music is the same backwards and forwards it's all connected!!! Now, the music is a bit loud so I would advice closed captioning to be safe.My second favorite part is all the Easter eggs. The story is incredible! But the foreshadowing dotted around the movie and the Easter eggs that when you see them make everything thing so connected.And finally, the cinematography is excellent! It is such a beautiful film and the way the cinematography is done allows you to understand the characters and the emotions without any verbal expression. Especially when combined with the music."
"Review of Tenet : Nolan is telling us what Inception would be like if it didn't work out.The visuals are great, but I still get distracted sometimes, and the characters are boring. Although you can see a lot of effort put into the film, the overall effect is not satisfactory."
"Review of Tenet : It had to happen. I was not sure what to think about this movie, but I went anyway. It was a very strange and extremely confusing movie. ( my wife would have hated) Great special effects though no wonder it cost so much money. It was over all an entertaining movie but very long. However, It's not the kind of movie that you need to see on the big screen. You would be better off watching at home with the subtitle so you can understand what they are saying and maybe you have to rewind. A few times. The science was off but which made the movie more confusing plus made some of the sequence out of place and did not make senses. But it was a cool concept that is for sure. Denzel Washington son did a good job. It was a hard movie to watch at times. This kind of movie would do well in a tv series where they have time to explain and take their time develop the plot more. I give it 7 out of 10. Because of the special effect and an original story."
"Review of Tenet : Tenet had a lot of the ""new Christopher Nolan movie"" hype, and the people who enjoy his movies were quite excited. There has always been, and always will be, that group of people of see Christopher Nolan movies as pretentious and bland, and while I've always enjoyed his movies, Tenet really felt worthy of that critique.
The most widespread problem with the whole movie was that it felt like Nolan was leaning on the concept of ""If I make the dialogue, exposition, and concept sound super complex and smart, no one will realize they don't know what's going on."" An argument can be made that all of his films fall under this problem, but in movies like Inception and even Interstellar, the complicated plot and subject matter could still be deciphered by the audience. And, there was enough to readily latch onto to make the audience want to piece things together. Tenet was confusing and very fast paced from the get go, and never really gave the audience any time to breathe. Not to mention that 70% of the dialogue was exposition dumps, and due to the sound mixing drowning out the dialogue more often than not, the convoluted explanations of what was happening never actually made things easier to follow. And you can have a complicated plot and premise worthy of the most elite and pretentious audience without making things confusing. In fact, complicated shouldn't mean confusing.The plot and pacing also didn't assist in the audience's ability to follow and be invested in what was happening. At least for me, it was pretty sporadic that I really cared about what was happening on screen, mostly due to that I often wasn't sure what the characters were working toward or trying to prevent. And I'd like to think I can follow movies pretty well, and if this were just a case of the plot and filmmaking being ""too complex"" and going over my head, that'd be fine. But it really seemed that the writing was problematic. Because things were not clear enough, soon enough. The rules of inverting were explained in a very dense exposition dump at the beginning, and around 2/3's into the movie after a shift in the plot, and for a premise as interesting as this one, the audience should know the rules concretely early on. And this isn't synonymous to the audience being babysat through the whole plot and needing their handheld through the whole film. Back to Inception, which is a reasonable comparison since it's another complicated thriller by the same director and writer, the rules of inception and dreaming were explained effectively and well early on. This could've been the same in Tenet, but we only had rushed exposition dumps. Not to mention, we have an action scene right off the bat and subsequent secret agency drama that is never really explained. Starting the audience with something chaotic and plunging them into the action isn't inherently a bad thing, but this was a confusing start. And The Protagonist being a part of the Tenet organization is just sort of thrown in there after he proves his loyalty to them? To his old team? Did he have an old organization or was it the same as the Tenet group? Anyway, he learns about the time inverting and then just...starts doing things to, prevent the impending war? Honestly, one of the other biggest problems is that the goals of the characters and of the story in general, aren't that clear until the end of the second act.So the character and plot goals, the way the Tenet organization and rules of inverting works, and what our characters were actually working toward with the drawing/Andrei shenanigans, all needed to be clearer sooner. It was difficult to latch onto the plot, and therefore, become invested in the story. You don't necessarily need to be limited by a three of five part story arc, but there really didn't feel like any story arc, whatsoever. It felt like meandering and random plot points that were working toward something that wasn't clear, until the lights were turned on and we learned what the characters were trying to prevent, and what they needed to do to do so.Now there are still pros along with these cons. They didn't outweigh them, but they were there. The performances, especially John David Washington and Kenneth Branagh, were amazing. JDW has this unique, reserved charisma that made watching him on screen very captivating. His chemistry with Robert Pattinson, who also had a great performance as Neil, made their scenes together the best of the movie. Elizabeth Debicki is criminally underrated as an actor in general, and she gave a great performance. It was a bit of a bummer that she was the only consistent female character in the movie and was also a victim of an abusive marriage, but she got a fulfilling arc where she defeated her husband when she couldn't in the past so, that's good at least. I guess. I wonder if Christopher Nolan will ever write more than 3 female characters in one movie, one of which not being a dead or victimized wife figure.Anyway, there were also some really interesting action scenes. There were two early on that were pretty traditional but done very well and not gratuitous. And the premise of inverting time is a very interesting one, that fostered a handful of very interesting half backward action scenes. In all honesty {spoiler} the action scene where Neil and The Protagonist go back to the Oslo airport and end up being the two they were fighting against in the past, was really interesting and satisfying to watch.Overall, the whole viewing experience was okay. There were enjoyable things, yes, but the movie was overwhelmingly just exposition dumps that didn't really explain things enough, some cool action scenes and music, decent cinematography, and great acting performances. It's not terribly memorable, and you certainly felt the long runtime a few times when the pacing lagged. Christopher Nolan is a name that comes with high expectations, and unfortunately, this didn't live up as much as it could've. 7/10."
"Review of Tenet : This is another beautiful and innovative movie from Nolan and shares themes from several of his previous works. The achievements of the writers & special effects team are completely offset by 2 major factors.Firstly the dialogue:SFX volume mix is wayyyy off. Your ears will be ringing from the brass-heavy typical Nolan soundtrack and while your hearing is being destroyed you're forced to try and listen to characters mumble-whisper the rest of the time (seriously, they may as well be wearing Bane's face mask). This already major flaw is exasperated by the fact that the film is exposition-heavy and constantly trying to explain what's going on. I really wanted to hear what these characters had to say but for the second half of the movie I just focused on trying to read lips, which didn't work either.Second is the complete lack of character development. I have to idea why The Protagonist (John David Washington) cares so much for the villian's wife & her plight, nor do I know a single shred of anything about him aside from he's basically a spy. I'm left feeling like the movie spent so much time trying to explain itself to the audience that it forgot some of the core concepts of good film. Washington's character does get a few good lines which hint at a witty personality but they are sparsely peppered throughout the movie. It would've been great to see him get more non-exposition dialogue, so we could understand who he is and form more of an attachment to him. Unfortunately the flat, one dimensional characters of the Protagonist & Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) lends more to cheesy cliché rather than Nolan masterpiece.With those flaws out of the way, the rest of the movie was good, mentally stimulating fun. The shots were beautiful and true to Nolan's form.
Although, I'd have liked to see a little less 'shakey cam' towards the end. Fight scenes were a unique experience & the action itself is worth the price of admission. Kenneth Branagh plays a convincing ""baddie"" & makes a thin motivation work. Robert Pattinson does a great job in support (as he did in Lost City of Z) and uses limited screen-time & dialogue to flesh out his character well.I definitely will watch this film again but will wait until I can at home... with the volume low... and subtitles on."
"Review of Tenet : I was surprised to see it playing here in Korea but I took the risk and went to my local theater.
The trailer reveals the stakes involved so I am not giving much away but I will say this I didn't feel a lot of tension based on those stakes. My attention was mostly focused on the developing story rather than having any time to process the dire consequences of our protagonist's possible failure. The plot can be overwhelming and confusing at times. A lot of the exposition happens in quick conversations so important details are easy to miss. Although, the movie doesn't honestly require you to understand everything to enjoy it. I didn't experience irritation over my confusion. I allowed the movie to take me along it's journey.
Kenneth Branagh had a difficult role in playing the ""ultimate"" villain. In my opinion, his character was a weak-point of the movie. His motivation seemed unbelievable to me. There wasn't a lot of time spent developing his character to make his intentions believable. I think the same goes with all the characters really.
I will say that I was not bored in the least throughout the whole runtime. It definitely is an engaging movie but one that could've benefit from more time fleshing out the characters which would've made the stakes seem higher and elevated the movie.
I did like it enough to know that I will re-watch it at some point (mostly to pick up the finer confusing details) but I may wait until there is a streaming release for it."
"Review of Tenet : I'm a big fan of Nolan and having some complexity to movies but it should not be the whole plot, if you don't take into account the time reverse thing the movie is really empty and it's just a bad action movie. The time thing is not interesting enough to be the whole movie. The scene that are supposed to at suspense don't have your attention because you are trying to understand the plot. The acting isn't great, the character are not putting emotion into it, and I thing the form of the movies where it never stop is not letting them doing anything. Overall it's not that bad of a movie but it's too complicated and the actor are not helping it at all."
Review of Tenet : Listen we all know Nolan swings for the fences of what's possible and pushes the realms of normality. This film for whatever reason just doesn't mesh together the way most of his films do even with complex suspension of disbelief aspects. It's often scattered and juxtaposed to a near outrageous level. The visuals are spectacular at times but also seem way too extravagant to take seriously other times. Robert Pattinson is flawless and probably the standout of the film with his vigorous performance. The same cannot be said about John David Washington's barren and emotionless lack of effort. I can't believe he was given the starring role. He brings the interest level down to almost unwatchable levels. Overall this is one of Nolan's rare misfires which he is capable of once in awhile.
Review of Tenet : The speech is very mumbled and not clear. The audio dialogue needs remixing and the background score and effects need lowering in volume. The character builds are non-existent. The plot is predictable. Action and special effects are very good but not ground breaking in this age when anyone can really shoot HD and then play it back backwards. Needs a second watch with sub titles.
"Review of Tenet : Greetings from Lithuania.I just came back from a premiere of ""Tenet"" (2020), a hugely anticipated new movie by Mr. Christopher Nolan - my favorite director. I'm a huge Nolan's fan, saw all his movie in a theater and they all left me speechless and i even consider ""Interstellar"" as my favorite film of this millennium - i'm a real Nolan's fan boy.And with my broken heart i can only say after seeing ""Tenet"" that it was a first real disappointment by this brilliant director. This time Mr. Nolan has outdone himself, and not in a good way. Story and plot were a mess. Its not ""Inception"" by any means - that movie had a very simple idea and plot which was put into this intriguing world and concept - it wasn't difficult to follow because you always knew exactly what was the goal, who is who and etc. ""Tenet"" does not had any of that. While i enjoyed the plot for a around first 40% of its run time, later its just become so convoluted that farther it went the more i was scratching my head and eventually started to rolling my eyes when Robert Pattinson's and John David Washington's characters were describing the plot to each other, jumping for and between, reading between the lines and etc - it was simply way to complicated and eventually convoluted. By the end of this movie i really didn't care what was going on nor did i tried to understand - the movie's plot and storytelling lost me completely. Its not Nolan ""the director"" who wasn't good here, but its Noland ""the screenwriter"" who i think overdone himself this time, and not in a good way. The good things in this movie were for me performance by Kenneth Branagh who was excellent villain, cinematography and basically all the production values in this movie - they are first rate. Unfortunately plot and storytelling were below average - they just didn't for me at all.Overall, unfortunately the year 2020 was a terrible year not only because of the virus, but also it was a year when we got a first flop from Mr. Nolan. Its not that its a bad movie, like i said production values are first rate but other then that you will be scratching your head in disbelieve of how convoluted and cold this movie is. For his next feature Mr. Nolan should slow it down with plot and maybe take his brother as writer to help - together they can put plots and screenplays like no other. ""Tenet"" unfortunately is not the case."
"Review of Tenet : To all the fans out there: please, don't downvote my review just 'cause I dared to give a 6-grade to a movie directed by Nolan. Read it first, thank you very much.OK, so, what is there to say about this ""Tenet""? Well, first and foremost, lemme tell you that the movie isn't ""bad"" in any way, shape or form. In a blockbuster world populated by ""Avengers"", ""Transformers"", awful Disney animated classics' remakes and the likes, you can't seriously go around sayin' that ""Tenet"" is bad entertainment without being scorned. It's definitely passable entertainment.But its director is really, really sly, and being such he managed to convince a lot of people (and especially a lot of critics) out there that he created a very profound and complicated movie, when in fact he did not. 'Cause ""Tenet"" is pretty much a Bond movie going backwards half of the time. The plot is really that simple and predictable - half an hour into it and you'd already grasp pretty much everything there is to grasp. I'm not being arrogant here, please believe me: go watch the movie and you'll realize that yourself. Guaranteed. Now that we have put that aside, I'll go on by laying everything out plain and simple:PROS:Great direction. That's a given: Nolan knows how to put the camera to best use and knows how to keep you hooked most of the time;Effective soundtrack. It's not by any chance memorable, but it nonetheless contributes a lot to the movie's overall atmosphere;Dark cinematography. Again, very effective and in line with the movie' ""serious"" tone;A couple of great action sequences. And the ""backwards special effects"" are really a treat to behold.
CONS:Mediocre dialogues and screenplay. I mean, a lot of times the dialogues are either cringeworthy or purely explanatory (and the bad guy has the worst lines of them all). On top of that, the screenplay tries the best to conceal its simple narrative, but can't quite manage to convince you that it's phenomenal and brilliant, or that in the end it's isn't just a matter of a banal spy story. And - by the way - the overall theme is too close to blatant fatalism for me to like.Cardboard characters. Every single one of them is a total ""spy movie"" cliché: from the ""Protagonist"" to the ridiculous villain. They're completely underdeveloped and so there's no chance that the viewers can indentify with them.Unconvincing main actor. Of course he's isn't on par with his father Denzel - but that's obvious. The problem is that he also isn't on par neither with Pattison nor especially with Branagh. Really a bad casting choice over here.Lack of pathos. You're not gonna feel any empathy towards the characters ('cause, as I said, they're not actually characters: they are puppets, cardboard puppets with no interesting personalities). Nolan himself doesn't seem to care about that, lost as he is in his ""entropy gimmick"".
Here you go. In conclusion - to sum it up - I'd say that ""Tenet"" is definitely a movie to be seen on the biggest screen possible. It's a decent blockbuster full of every kind of action and vaguely intriguing in its premise. It's also - however - let down by a predictable storyline and mediocre dialogues. It lacks pathos and presents us with a main actor who is not really that good. But at the very least Nolan with this new movie is trying to do something different from the majority of other big budget productions and we gotta hand it to him. Anyway, his movie isn't by any standard a great one.
That's all I had to say. So long folks, and may the ""Sator square"" be with you!"
"Review of Tenet : Whilst I admired the cinematography, the backing soundtrack and music was too loud, sometimes louder than the dialogue.
Two and a half hours seemed to go on and on with not much happening, a lot of repeating itself?
Perhaps I am that average film goer and should stick to Eurovision.
The six people in our screening stayed very quiet.
I liked the Michael Caine cameo appearance."
"Review of Tenet : I wrote a small essay in order to keep up with the story and even then, only by the skin of my teeth.But then, in the final few minutes, when the big bad thing has seemingly been avoided, I was in a maze of incomprehensibility again.This film is all about the ying and yang, how everything needs balance, but Nolan failed to see that the ability to follow this story also needs the same balance. Travel far enough and you'll come back on yourself, bury your hand in ice, it will feel like it's burning... make a film that is so intelligent... it's dumb again.Nolan has been given the impression that the audience are smart: they could cope with Inception, yup, it was great. But then Nolan must have thought ""so, the audience can follow complex plot-lines... of any complexity"" and forgot that we are not in his head and being lost in his own bubble.A couple of moments in the film throw us totally off and require many re-watches to figure out but some are dumb: at one point, our uninspiring protagonist (why this actor?!) shoots at himself and nothing can explain that away. He is trying to kill himself...?!And then there are the masks: pretty much our only clear indication that things are running in reverse. But Nolan mucks around with that concept too, confusing us further.You can have too much intelligence. You can have too much of anything.Unsatisfying.Oh, and stop it with the ""saving one person against the world"" thing. We get it. It's been done."
"Review of Tenet : There are elements of Christopher Nolan's Tenet that has been inspired by other sources. 12 Monkeys, La Jetée, The Red Dwarf episode called Backwards, Steven Moffat's Doctor Who stories featuring River Song.Stripped of its gimmick of inverted time. It is basically John Le Carre's The Night Manager. Elizabeth Debicki appeared in the television adaptation and basically plays a similar character in Tenet.The Protagonist (John David Washington) teams up with sidekick Neil (Robert Pattinson) to stop Russian oligarch Sator (Kenneth Branagh) who has found a way to send a destructive weapon back from the future.In this temporal war, the Protagonist needs to get to Sator via his estranged wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki.)The inverted backward effects are eye dazzlingly conveyed. Nolan once again goes for an expensive high concept James Bond type set pieces.However the various going ons in the story is confusing. Not helped by terms such as Time Inversion, Temporal Pincer movement. I found the trick is to follow the forward narrative of Neil and not be confused by the The Protagonist's stories.Tenet is an enjoyable funfair ride. However I also felt that it was something you would quickly forget as you do not want to spend a lot of time thinking about it. I have no doubts that I would watch it again at a later date.Due to Covid 19, the cinema I saw it at was almost empty and I watched it on a weekend. That did somewhat rob the atmosphere."
"Review of Tenet : Whoever did the sound mixing should be fired. The sounds and music were far louder than the dialogue which made it impossible to tell what anyone was saying. As for the story itself, I found it gimmicky, simplistic and predictable. I admire the amount of work that went into bringing this idea to life, especially the technical aspect which was perfectly executed with visual amazement and action. However, it felt like an artificial and forced physics demonstration with very jumpy pacing more than a genuine story with an emotional core. At times it dabbles in a bit of character depth (Elizabeth Debicki's character being the real star here) but this is balanced by some rather baffling or blunt moments as well. It was fun to watch this movie imagining that Washington's protagonist is actually the same as his character from BlacKkKlansman (2018)."
"Review of Tenet : You can watch this once, twice or ten times; watch it forward or reverse; it doesn't matter, Nolan's story is riddled with amateur plot and technical issues. Aside from the convoluted story that has nothing to do with anyone's intellect to grasp it, Nolan threw in a bunch of useless Red Herrings and got lazy compared to his successful Inception movie. So no, you're not dumb if you didn't get this film; Nolan was just smoking some real wacky stuff to come up with this upchuck.Then add the ridiculous 250 min runtime that could've been easily told much better in 90-100 minutes, the illegible dialogue due to poor fake accents, terrible sound editing, and the annoying and overbearing B-grade film score, and you've got one heck of an annoyingly long, boring and confusing film.The casting was decent overall - mainly Pattinson, but I felt Washington wasn't convincing enough to be the Protagonist. The sets, locations and visuals were excellent, but not enough to settle down the other annoyances.It's a very generous 6/10 from me."
"Review of Tenet : ***** Potential SPOILERS *****Tenet follows the great Nolan tradition of really bad sound. It annoyingly loud and at times you can't hear what characters are saying. Nolan, fire your sound mixer. If you're mixing it yourself, fire yourself and get someone who knows what they're doing. Really s#!t work.It's also really badly edited (whether that's strictly editing or the script itself, who knows?). Some scenes happen with zero segue, and then at other points the movie gets bogged down. Unfortunately it's hard to care about the characters and story. Everything is a bit too rushed, and you don't have time to really soak it up and enjoy it.The time-bendiness is classic Nolan, but it's obscure and difficult to get a grasp on. Maybe the film will fare better with repeated viewings, but after a one-off watching it's potential tantalizingness is significantly diminished. Yes, there are some great things to ponder, but the core narrative of the story is buried so deep that it becomes a little ineffective. There is a reason for the time-bendiness, but it's obscured and to be honest I was a bit weary by the time it was all revealed.The basic plot of the film is okay, but I didn't really dig the ""inversion"" part. It's clunky and odd. Some great ideas and scenes, but overall it was difficult to follow clearly.Plus, the time-bendiness is never really explored in a way that lets you revel in it. Rather, it's hidden and revealed bit by bit which unfortunately means that you don't get to fully enjoy it.There's no theme here, at least in the way that other Nolan films have; Inception was about redemption, Interstellar was about the power of love or something, the Prestige was about revenge etc etc. This one doesn't really have that. Not a bad thing, though.The acting is okay, but Nolan never gives the audience time to settle in. The relationship between Washington and Debicki's characters seems to be important, but why? Who knows? Neither character is given time to answer that question sufficiently.This is really the main problem here. The pacing of the film is a bit all over the place, and it's hard to get involved with it. It jumps about from scene to scene at times with no explanation. I mean, I was able to follow it, but a few times I was asking ""What are they doing and why?"" and it took a while to understand (I'm not talking about the time-bendiness here either), which really diminished the film. In one scene, they're trying to get to a particular character. Why? You don't know till the scene is halfway finished. So instead you just sit there and watch them do some admittedly neat action scenes, but it's undermined because I have no idea what the goal is.Overall, it's okay. It spends too much time trying to hide it's big reveals for them to be effective, and it's too rushed/badly paced to get into. I hope that repeated viewings (on Netflix) will make it better."
"Review of Tenet : Compared to Nolan's ingenious Inception, Tenet is also ingenious but too entropic. That is: the positive and negative entropy throughout the cinematically stunning film makes it difficult - sometimes too difficult - to follow. And it becomes a bit tedious to watch the long forward/backwards time/entropy scenes. The philosophical questions and paradox of time/entropy travels remain, just like in the Terminator series, but with the added twist of ""inversion"" and matter/antimatter annihilation, which - again - is ingenious, but chaotic, and perhaps too ambitious? Not among Nolan's best movies, sorry."
"Review of Tenet : Other people have said this already, but I feel like this film leaves a lot of questions to be asked. I'm okay with a sci-fi films as long as we get what the film is trying to get across. But...I feel like the film throws too much at you too quickly off the bat, then spends so much time trying to explain what is going on but not actually achieving anything-ish... I just couldn't follow what was going on.It's a classic film to watch repeatedly on streaming services or physical copy. You will most likely leave the theatres confused if you watch this expecting to be given the answers to the holes you find along the way.Avg. 7.8/10 at the time of this review, does that mean it actually has a 8.7 rating?"
"Review of Tenet : Straightforward review:Plot: Feels forced, cliche'd and had me facepalming in embarassment at several moments. Badly written villain, tired subplot of a damsel in distress. Its also not as complicated as I was led to believe, it's pretty straightforward actually. I saw comparisons to Primer, which in my opinion is a much better time-travel tale. This feels more like a James Bond movie with a time-travel element added to it.Effects are done well, technically the movie is very well made. But it feels a bit over the top, almost Michael Bay-like at times.Acting ranges from excellent to okay, the script doesn't help in this case but the actors do a good job considering. Pattinson is the standout for me.All in all its not a bad movie to waste some time on, it's interesting enough to keep you engaged (was struggling to finish the last 30mins myself though). As far as mainstream blockbusters go it's decent."
"Review of Tenet : At the outset I would to like to note that Nolan is my favourite director/ film maker. Yes, there are many legendary directors we have had over generations but it is Christopher Nolan who just redefined how a movie should be 'presented' to the audience. Hans Zimmer's music direction for his movies was (is) legendary. How many times before Nolan we bothered to listen to movie OSTs? I can't recall many times, if any. The end package that Nolan creates is extraordinary and for viewers like me who like to be thrilled after (and during) a movie remain ever so happy and thankful for that.Now coming to this movie, as you can see my rating is only 60%, because IMHO that's what this movie should be given. It's NOT a masterpiece like Inception was. It is not Memento. It is not Interstellar. The basis of the movie is time inversion and the physics behind it is fine and maybe acceptable in a world where Turnstile (or a machine/ tech. alike) already exists but there is indeed a tremendous problem of exposition in this film, which leaves the audience confused and unhappy. While the attention to detail is impeccable (seriously the more you watch it more surprising it gets in terms of detailing), the fast camera shifts especially at critical junctures was disappointing.I won't go into the physics of it as I only have a basic idea of the subject but this is a Science Fiction after all and the Fiction part shows. 'What's happened's happened'- fine. But one must remember human beings are not programmed creatures, at least not yet, therefore the underlying concept that the present version of you are going to do things exactly as it happened as by your past version doesn't make sense to me. Maybe I am wrong, but doesn't feel like it. This is the reason why I can't call this movie a Nolan great, let alone a masterpiece.I enjoyed the acting of Pattinson (he was really extraordinary), Branagh, Debicki and few others, Washington's performance may have left something to desire, but eh it was fine. The background music was absolutely fantastic, yes, at times too loud but the different tracks based on the on-screen scenes synced almost perfectly.While this film remains the one I have watched most number of times, it also certainly is the least perfect and impactful Nolan film for me."
"Review of Tenet : *** POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD ***Ok, I don't review many titles, but I feel the need to address this self-agrandizing Nolan 'epic' for what it is. And that is, a quasi-scientific bunch of hooey about a topic that clearly neither Nolan nor his target audience know much about. Having studied time, causality, quantum mechanics, GR/SR & a number of other time-related branches of physics, I have to say, I was quite under-whelmed by this one-trick pony. So much that I found it almost as annoying as Memento, or Matrix 2 & 3, a couple other one-trickers. Before you jump to conclusions, yes, I got it, I understood what it was all about, while piecing together the barely-heard conversations & expositions at several points in the film - turn down the effing music Nolan - I can listen to classical music any time I want without having to strain to hear someone bloody well speaking about major plot points!The main issue I have with Tenet is that it's all sci-fi nonsense & barely good sci-fi at that, mostly fantasy actually. Real physics aside, it just wasn't entertaining once you get the 'trick'. It just tried too hard to pander to neo-intelletuals with quasi-science causality mini-loops splattered throughout. Not to mention the motivations of the main bad guy are non-sensical, except for a completely insane psycopath who somehow manages to keep everyone loyal around him in the dark...because if they even had an inkling of what he wanted to achieve, why in God's name would anyone NOT completely insane ever help the maniac??? It's patently absurd & ridiculous with a number of glaring inconsistencies & plot holes that most will just gloss over. Even as pure entertainment I felt that my intelligence was being insulted, and I'm certainly no genius-level intellect! I can only imagine how all the poor career physicists must feel out there, to see their life's work assaulted by Hollywood like this yet again...In the end, it's about as satifying as invert sugar (pun intended). Watch at your own risk if you have 2.5 hrs to kill you definitely won't want back on your death bed. For the rest of you with some sense, I recommend you watch Primer instead if you want a more 'realistic' foray into time & causality loops, without the big budget, car chases & CGI explosions. You have been warned. 6/10 (mostly for Caine, Pattinson & the scenery)"
"Review of Tenet : Nothing interesting happens, and it happens at a very high pace. The plot is like that of an inferior James Bond movie. John David Washington, Robert Pattison, and Kenneth Branagh are good actors, but wasted on flat characters. Nolan tries to make the theme seem complicated, but it is very thin, and when we get to the 3rd ride through time, it gets rather boring."
"Review of Tenet : One hour and thirty minutes in, this was the point I officially lost the plot. For the final hour I sat back, enjoyed the action set pieces, marvelled in the sound mixing but the plot was put out to pasture for me. Without completely spoiling for those yet to see it, Tenet is Christopher Nolan set loose on the manipulation of time as we know it. But that, that's only half the story here, because a lesson in physics isn't fully complete without government espionage set across multiple countries. But what really frustrates me is the potential this had going into the final hour. Two well built relationships, a budding cop comedy set up between lead and BFF Pattinson and an extremely well written vengeful hatred between husband and wife. What could have been. Six out of ten is my ultimate pick, but this deserved more, and ultimately entertainment, sitting back and enjoying a thrillingly paced film was sacrificed for an over complex exploration into scientific theory."
"Review of Tenet : Good action and effects, but hard to properly follow and you'll give up at a point.Interesting concept, but too much of the movie is spent trying to explain it to you. These explanations miss the grade school writing recommendation of 'show not tell'.The performance of the main protagonist is underwhelming and as a whole you'll likely fail to really connect or get overly invested in the story.Saw it in theaters and went in with high hopes given Nolan's many previous bangers. Shame it's a flop. I wouldn't tell someone not to see it, but they're not missing anything if they don't."
"Review of Tenet : In order to create a good futurist/science fiction film, we need to play by some rules. First of all, if there is technology that is pivotal to the story, it behooves the writer or producer to let us know how it works. Also, what it does, exactly. This movie, while quite electrifying, doesn't bother. There is a type of time device that allows one to turn things backward, to reverse entropy, which we know will be the end of the world. Once this device, which is badly explained, becomes the focus, the movie travels through paths already seen a hundred times. It is all shooting, chasing, fighting, with enough explosions to fill up an hour. I looked forward to this but by the time I'd made through thirty minutes I was utterly bewildered. And don't tell me to watch it again. It should explain itself in one viewing.."
Review of Tenet : Can't hear anyone speak. Ear bleeding in parts. Huge practical set up effects. Intriguing and original story. But ultimately soulless.The lead actor is really really bad at acting he gives such a stale performance it looks like he is acting. Like he is on screen and you can tell he is trying to carefully remember what he's doing. Terrible.Storyline is clever and it's visually brilliant but it is a run by the numbers nolan flick.It's worth going to see on the big screen but you will come out of the cinema with a sore head from having your eyebrow raised to the roof for 2.5 hours.Nowhere near Nolan's best.
"Review of Tenet : First of all, this movie was overly complex and too complicated. I've seen every Nolan film and loved them all, but this was by far his worst. It was clearly made to be digested more than once, but if I'm going to do that, I usually have to enjoy it the first time around. There are important plot points that are explained only once, and sometimes with the dialogue drowned out by the music and lost in the mix.It starts off with an action sequence, which is a problem for me right away. How am I supposed to feel a sense of danger for these people, before I am even emotionally invested in any characters? And it doesn't get any better. There is no character development or arcs to speak of. The film is just a series of action sequences and dialogue interactions, with very little emotion or drama. It's hard to care about a couple of guys trying to save the world, when the film's world is so void of life and feeling.The whole premise of the film is just an excuse for some trippy action sequences, like Inception. While they were very cool and well executed, the problems were being constantly confused with why they were doing what they were doing, and why I should care.The music was amazing, as always (despite not working with Hans Zimmer this time), but obviously not enough to save an over-complicated and lifeless screenplay. I really appreciate Christopher Nolan, and the fact that he has the ability to make such high budget blockbusters for the thinking person, but I did not enjoy the ride, and I came so close to giving up on it and walking out."
"Review of Tenet : Tenet is based on inconsistency. The action sequences are amazing, the score was maginificient and the cinematography are beyond word. I was ready to enjoy the movie with my popcorn, until they slip the time bending manauver thing that makes me leave my popcorn cold till the end, because i'm busy trying to figure it out what's going on. I did not enjoy the movie at all! They are adding more and more detail to the plot and won't bother to explain it (while they should) just to make everything looks more chaotic, and selfishly demand us to do a rewatch? Is this some kind of a new marketing stuff?Tenet give us a premise of action movies, next they gave us a time bending manauver that they didn't bother to explain, finally
the action blend with it, and we are forced to keep up while our brain still wondering? Sorry, the feeling didn't makes us WOW, but instead it makes us WHAT?..and that's not a good sign for an action moviesNolan was good at this i remember, Momento is exactly dealing with this backwards kind of plot, but what makes Momento so much more better? They offer the audience with an actual character study. How are we suppose to invest with the story, if the only one has a background and motivation is the sidekick, and they didn't even care to name the main protagonist?"
"Review of Tenet : Hoo boy. Not sure how to review the latest Nolan brain-twister. Maybe in reverse?The opening was thrilling - major vibes from the opening scene of ""The Dark Knight."" But it went sideways (or multiple-ways) from there.I went in knowing this was mind-bending. That it would take multiple viewings to make sense of it. But it was beyond confusing. It was unintelligible.At some point, I was so confused (watching things/people go backward through time while things/people go forward in time will do that to you), I pulled up a scene-by-scene recap on my phone. And even that didn't help.Great acting: Check.Awesome cinematography: Check.Pounding soundtrack: Check.Do you ever watch a 2.5 hour James Bond movie and wonder ""Where in the world are they now? Which massive death-defying air/sea/land chase are we watching now?""That's essentially what this is ... A confusing epic Bond movie with a ""reverse-time"" brain teaser thrown in.Expect to read/watch a recap (or two) afterwards to try and make sense of it (trust me - it doesn't help)."
"Review of Tenet : Seriously, can you tell? What exactly is anyone doing anything? Who tf are they fighting in that last battle? Who are they shooting? Why are the bad guys doing what they're doing knowing what's gonna happen? Why are the dialogues so childish and amateurish?WTF was the sailing scene? What the actual F was the point of that? Why is the editing so weird?The ""protagonist"" doesn't know and in his 30 years of life never heard of the grandpa paradox so the other guy explains it to him so the audience can know what it is? Is that the best way you can come up with an exposition? Are you serious? ""The whole world will fkn end"", ""oh no, my son will die too"". ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!?!Inception was good because the movie explained the rules of that world and we understood why things were happening and what the motivation of each character was, but this? Yeah, good luck finding anything that makes sense in this. Ask Nolan and even he doesn't know wtf he wrote and what the rules of this nonsensical world is.The movie is just too fkn fast-paced for its own good. Movie is 2 and a half hours but it's like a theatrical version of a 3 or 3:30hour director cut.With this rate Nolan's going, I'm thinking his next movie will be just 2 hours of earr*pe soundtrack and we can't even understand with subtitles. Going back to the root of cinema and have ""silent film"" with just music and subtitles. Go and look up ""Confessions of a Christopher Nolan Fanboy"" on youtube to see why Nolan movies are getting more like the way they are now.I'm already so bored with this one that I don't think I'm gonna watch it a second time."
"Review of Tenet : Those who liked 'Tenet' said it was confusing. Those who hated 'Tenet' said it was confusing. Having read so many contradicting reviews about 'Tenet' I decided to watch it for myself to make up my own mind.I tried so hard to understand the film by carefully listening to the dialogue and observing every inch of detail. However, I found myself lost ever so often. The quick-cut editing and fast-spoken dialogue made it all the more difficult to follow.'Tenet' is trying so hard to take time travel to the next level. Did they succeed? I suppose that would depend on your views of the film. It sure as hell confused the audience. And who enjoy watching confusing movies? And if your audience is still lost an hour into the movie, there's something wrong with the narration... or Nolan is just such a genius that our puny minds can't comprehend his vision and understanding.Nevertheless, I decided to stuck it out and kept watching. The final our started making sense, and the action sequences were good (nothing mind blowing, though). Once I understood the concept of inverted entropy (not only moving back in time, but also backwards in time), it was easier to follow. It was still way over-complicated.Another big issue for me, was the film's lead: John David Washington, who starred as Protagonist (seriously, Christopher Nolan, you couldn't give your protagonist a name other than Protagonist????). He lacked emotion and for most parts looked either tired or lazy. There was very little enthusiasm from him as an actor. He certainly did NOT make a likable or credible hero. Maybe he himself was so confused that he didn't know what the hell he was doing and concentrated too hard on saying all those confusing lines.The visuals were interesting in the beginning, but during the final act it simply looked like a film that was playing in reverse. In closing, 'Tenet' is not a movie I can recommend. If you want to watch it to see what the hype was all about, then go ahead. But there are far better and easier to understand action movies out there. And to sit through this for two and a half hours is exhausting.Christopher Nolan's 2000 movie 'Memento' was far better. This was also an interesting concept where the story was moving back in time, but at the same time moving forward."
"Review of Tenet : In simplistic manner, i would like to tell fellow bourgeoisie looking to comsume media, if you have one good day in the week, dont waste it on this one. But if you are a forty something dude with a podcast looking to impress Dads in your neighbourhood, i would say break a leg.Might a few nerds disagrees with me on this while reviving the Temporal paradox theories but any good director need to get the basics right before it starts showing the big brains.As few Smarty Pants states that this movie requires multiple viewing to understand, I would argue that a good story should be UNDERSTANDABLE with a single viewing when viewer paying attention.I know , i know i am not smart enough to understand the movie mannnnn.Out of the 5 elements of a story it only gets few right.I won't rant about the sound desing or editing etc, i am sure you can find complaining on internet even if you aren't looking for one."
"Review of Tenet : Following a muddlesome terrorist attack on an opera, this unnamed chap (who I shall call Z) is introduced to the phenomenon of inversion. Inversion is the reversal of entropy, and can be applied to an object, a location, one or more individuals etc. This means that time can run forwards and backwards at more or less the same time in more or less the same place. It is dangerous: if overused it can overbalance entropy, which will end everything. And a nasty Russian piece of work is trying to collect bits of a mechanism so that he can activate an algorithm...Christopher Nolan's latest follows Inception and interstellar and, if you thought they were difficult to understand and follow, you ain't seen nothin' yet.Inversion is a great maguffin. The problem here is that in order to follow the story, you need to have an understanding of how inversion works, and that's exactly what you don't get here. In fact a lady scientist early on says ""Don't try to understand it, just accept it,"" and this is effectively writer/director talking to the viewer. I think this is code for him saying ""I haven't really thought this through completely, so don't expect it to make sense."" Given that it has taken him years to write this...There are various problems. Given that you have time running backwards and forwards at the same time, it's fair to generate an element of ""What's going on?"" to be answered when a reverse-time sequence unfolds in positive time back to its start at the end. But what I just said gives some indication of how preplexing the film is when much of it is told that way. A number of IMDB reviews say it was gibberish on first viewing, made sense on second viewing. My opinion is that you shouldn't have to see a film twice for it to make sense, especially if it takes a frustrating two and a half hours to watch it once.The next problem is that dialogue is mumbled and buried under general noise, making it nearly impossible to hear very necessary exposition.I'm not going to go on about this film which would have been a great deal better if it had been a great deal simpler, and which would have benefitted from Nolan having a co-writer on board to act as the viewer's friend. This film is NOT the greatest thing since sliced bread. I give it 5 out of 10, which is what happens when a 10/10 positive entropy maguffin meets an inversed 0/10 script."
"Review of Tenet : I am a big Nolan and Sci-Fi fan, and there's no question serious effort went into this movie. No question, the visuals were great, the acting was great, but the editing, PLOT and over-all effect was simply unsatisfying.The plot is full of discontinuity and random plot elements, and the main time reversal issue is never adequately explained, resolved or identified, and even the cryptic ""Tenet"" keyword never seems to appear outside of the trailer cuts. The most annoying aspect was the often incomprehensible audio, due to masks and bad editing, that made many key moments a total mystery.The plot is also littered with bad science of every possible kind, random statements that simply make no real sense (even using the odd time scenario) , and when viewed as ongoing story make you stop and say, how did we ever get HERE? The gun and bullet demonstration really sticks in my mind as total and complete cinematic plot garbage.I don't doubt this could have been a masterful movie, but unlike Memento or Inception, the script and story continuity were simply not up to the complex story task. The one word that sticks in my mind about this movie is disappointing. After the long delay, i really expected something a lot better than this. Maybe a later edit will fix this, but it certainly doesn't need to get any longer."
"Review of Tenet : I've always been fascinated with the concept of time in books, plays and films, from JB Priestley to Doctor Who, from ""Back to the Future"" to even Harry Potter. All of these, with the arguable exception of some of the Stephen Moffat-written episodes of Our Man / Woman from Galifrey, I've found relatively easy to follow but there can't be any doubt that Christopher Nolan is next level on the subject. I even struggled with ""Memento"", his breakthrough feature, never mind the likes of ""Interstellar"" or ""Inception"", heck, I somehow missed the simultaneous triple-time-conception of ""Dunkirk"".Here, at least for me, he took it just too far and lost me along the way. John David Washington's Protagonist character is trying to take down Kenneth Branagh's Sator Russian oligarch who has discovered the existence of a novel doomsday machine, to wit, a weapon from the future which inverts the past. Despite a female scientist having a clearly expository dialogue with Washington's secret agent extraordinaire to presumably set up the premise, I must admit I was still none the wiser and if I was being honest I'd have to say that I pretty much stayed that way right to the end.Not that parts of the film didn't entertain me, where Nolan's undoubted skill with large-scale, logistically ambitious set-pieces are both eye-catching and jaw-dropping in terms of scale and execution. From the carnage at the Kiev Opera House, Washington and new partner Robert Pattinson's scaling of a tall building in central Mumbai to the felt-like-it-was-never-ending ten-minute countdown both towards and against time at the end, there are certainly some amazing and memorable sequences, with backwards and forwards depiction of events in the one shot, often with backwards-played music for effect. That said, we can surely all remember as children seeing reversed old film-reels where a demolished building magically reconstructs if you play it backwards but really it happens a little too often here so that the effect is somewhat dissipated.As you would expect in a high concept, effects-driven movie like this, characterisation is thin, with the baddie's on-off relationship with his estranged English wife played by Elizabeth Debicki, being about as deep as it goes into human motivations with everybody else running about daft trying to save the universe as we know it.Fair play to the actors for playing their parts as if they actually understood what was going on because I certainly didn't. A feast for the eyes it may well have been but it was all a bit too much for my brain to process. And serious kudos to those who fully watched, understood and were entertained by it. As for me, I think I could relive and rewatch the movie a hundred times over and still not come away any the wiser.Maybe I should rewatch it. But in more ways than one I just don't see me making the time for it."
"Review of Tenet : Tenet too often feels like an overly long gimmick because the film lacks the plot, the characters or the acting to hold the attention otherwise. The film shows technical accomplishment in depicting action in reverse but that is about it.The plot is a convoluted mess and long before the end I lost interest in trying to follow it.There may be multiple timelines and versions of the characters, but the film doesn't make them interesting enough to care. John David Washington in the lead role lacks charisma and isn't strong enough to carry the film. Branagh's accent is all over the place as the weak Russian villain. Pattinson does better as the stereotypical shady fixer while Debicki is solid as the damsel in distress.Going into this I was hoping for something along the lines of Inception but instead Tenet just continues the long decline from Christopher Nolan since that 2010 hit."
"Review of Tenet : I had big expectations for Tenet, since I first watched the trailer. Instead, the movie is very confusing and maybe in order to understand it, I need to watch it more than once. I managed to follow halfway through it, but then I was completely lost. Except the main two characters Neil and The Protagonist, the rest of the cast is pretty flat and Kat is really annoying, especially towards the end. At least actors were good enough to maintain the whole thing afloat.From a technical perspective the movie is good, and there are a few good scenes here and there, but I would say that special effects were cheap and lazy. I mean, from a visionary director such as Nolan I wasn't expecting for sure a bunch of reversed clips. The ending had no sense at all and you cannot actually understand what is happening.If this is the movie that was supposed to relaunch cinemas, after the lockdown period, well, I suggest to look elsewhere. Tenet is unoriginal and uninspired, Nolan already made movies about space and time such as ""Inception"" or ""Interstellar"", so I think that in this case he could have change the topic.A real pity. Movie's definitely too long and there are many stretched out sequences and useless story lines. Instead of deepening some details, which could actually make understand something about what's happening. I suggest to give it a try, but do not expect a masterpiece."
"Review of Tenet : ""Tenet"" is another overrated mess by Christopher Nolan, who is a Hollywood's darling. The story seems to be written under influence, in a confused screenplay. The action and mainly the special effects are top notch. But Denzel Wahington's son is not adequate for the role of super-spy and the plot is a complete mess hard to be followed. ""Tenet"" is adequate for Nolan's worshipers that do not have prejudice to paradoxes and confused stories, and for pseudo-intellectuals that do not fully understand the plot and are ashamed to confess. Do not waste your time watching this long mess if you are not in the previous categories. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Tenet"""
"Review of Tenet : I love the work of Mister Nolan, but it didn't work this time.
The film lacks of pace and charisma. Sometimes it's boring to keep watching.
Maybe he tried to hit the originality of ""inception"", but the editing and the story didn't help.
The sound mixing is really good as always and the Kenneth Branagh's performance is the highlight of the movie.
Some fights scenes are close to childish execution.
Anyway, I hope Nolan does better in a near future."
"Review of Tenet : The movie is very nice, but it would be even better if they edited the audio properly. Speeches are muffled and almost always covered by other sounds, which make a complex movie hard to follow and understand."
"Review of Tenet : The bad:
This story is completely silly and a complete mess. And it's too long. (2 and a half hours!) Let's face it, how long can a director capture an audience with a gimmick of walking backwards through life? We did it as a kid, walking backwards. It was fun then. But making an entire movie about it and thinking you are smart? Who were they kiddin'?More bad: let's not even talk about the ridiculous editing pace of this movie. A simple conversation between 2 persons is being cut as if it were an action sequence. The actors AND the acting aren't very impressive either: lots of silly accents (Robert Pattison with his ""English"" accent) and lots of B-actors without real charisma.The good:
This movie is really intrigueing at the start. And quite exciting as well. There is lots of frenzy like action from the get go. Although I didnt understand anything that went on, from the very beginning, it all looked quite cool and fascinating. Not understanding can be interesting...More good: the movie looks beautiful. The design is impressive. Some of the camerawork is pretty classy. There is also a frenzy like feel throughout this movie, which I liked.But in the end this movie is a gimmick that failed. It's a wannabe smart movie,that upon closer inspection is rather silly..."
"Review of Tenet : I wish I could give this a better rating, but when only half the dialogue is audible it's impossible to follow the plot. Left confused and disappointed. Will have to wait for subtitles to watch again. As released with the horrendous audio mix, it's a 5."
"Review of Tenet : There was always going to be a point from which Nolan would fail to capture and retain the attention of audiences. This is it. It's not a bad movie, the acting is good, even the concept is interesting, but I tried to get into the story and connect all the actions but at one point I just gave up and let go. I am sure others will have had the endurance. There is a bit of Lynch's Mulholland Drive here with the second part providing an opportunity to understand fully what's happening to be fair. Maybe it takes a second viewing but where with Inception or Interstellar (or even Memento) this was an exciting perspective, it feels like burden for this one. There had to be a way to make things more within reach, maybe with a simpler plot around the concept."
"Review of Tenet : Well, I could suffer much more with this absurd movie, but i was enough wise to avoid the suffering. Why people try to understand garbage like this? When at a first sight you can see the final result: a protagonist without personality, scenes plenty of unnecessary violence, excess of special effects, and at last an clumsy attempt to make up the mediocrity of the film using some well known actors with no results. I can accept mister Nolan isa very distinguished director. In fact, I enjoy very much most oh his work, but this time, what Can I say: this work is a failure in many ways, a very boring movie in despite of all the action the director adds at any moment. Anyway, a waste of time..."
"Review of Tenet : This movie is annoying. It has a very simple plot, premise and sequence of events and yet it psychotically scrambles every story beat with a thick of fog
of ""COOL!"" and ""SMART!"". And yes it does so, shoutingly.
Courtesy of the sound mixing. Yet it does these things while forgetting about any action films single most important rule: Motivation.
I couldn't understand why anyone did anything because I was never told the reason. Even when it came to the stakes of the story I was not told what it is I need to fear or why.
And I want to be clear on this.
I was actually told ALL of these things, but I wasn't shown.
A good 70% of this film feels like Chris Nolan is reading his script to us like we are his teachers, who'll fail him if he doesn't try hard enough.
But an action film, which this is, that is as convoluted and confusing as this is, rarely delivers an impact.
I like the premise more than the execution.
This should have been simple.
There was no reason to make Tenet that long or dreadfully pseudo intellectual.
I felt pretty mistreated, by this director whom I've come to appreciate as an effective artist.
Anyways, after watching it a second time, I realized it wasn't me that didn't get it, but there is just an overabundance of plot-holes.
So don't pat yourself on the back if you ""got it"", because you can't.
It's a dumb action-time-travel-movie pretending to be so much more.
I hope the next one doesn't suck, Chris!"
"Review of Tenet : The first rule of a thriller is that it's got to be thrilling or exciting. Yet for all the fights, explosions and kinetic action, this film is curiously dull and uninvolving. Like Inception, the overall impression is of a director so impressed with his own high concept and intellect that the human element is a tacked-on afterthought to a film overwhelmed by admiration for its own cleverness. And yet it's not all that clever. For all its technical aplomb, the time travel elements are no more impressive or puzzling than the average episode of Doctor Who. Every revelation was predictable and obvious and, frankly, reversed film and people running backwards gets old quite quickly. The pretentiousness and lack of humour is clearly signalled by the naming of the central protagonist 'Protagonist'. It's basically a Bond film with delusions of intellectual profundity. Come back, George Lazenby, all is forgiven..."
"Review of Tenet : This movie makes no sense, it's loop every thing is already done, you can't change the future, all the movie is doing is explaining what's going on for a 2:30h ! Why bother making a movie at all? Do you expect people to watch this again and again? Nah I am OK with once, And are we going to ignore the fact that you can't hear anything but sound effects, Nolan really?"
"Review of Tenet : Nolan is a genius without a doubt and he proves it again and again with all his movies. However, I perceived this movie as a step further in the sense that he does not want to prove himself but rather expect us to respect and give more appreciation to his genius.How many times did you feel lost during the movie? How many times you were searching for an answer to what has just happened? How many times did you have to watch to understand the whole plot? Inception was a very complicated masterpiece but it was understandable. Interstellar was crazy but based on an understandable and meaningful plot. This movie is directed on purpose to be overcomplicated and obscure. This movie wants to be rewatched again and again until you get all the answers from really small details.Throughout the movie, I felt like Nolan was testing my intelligence and wishing me to fail by giving explanations that does not make sense until the very end of the movie. I felt like he wanted me to get lost and just appreciate that he is the creator of this complex paradoxical narrative.I don't like it. I don't want to be belittled by a movie and I will definitely not spend my time to understand his genius. This movie has serious problems in terms of communicating with the audience."
"Review of Tenet : Sadly I couldn't understand or hear the dialogue, and I could not follow the interminable plot. Far too long, I was just waiting to be able to leave. Some beautiful photography, but a lacklustre cast. Give it a miss."
"Review of Tenet : I regret not watching this subtitled as I have no idea what happened in this film.
It's confusing enough as it is, but when you can't understand what anyone is saying it's impossible. I advise everyone to watch this subtitled. I'm sure the film is good but it's a shame I couldn't hear any of the dialogue, the audio needs fixing"
"Review of Tenet : The first 40 minutes moved at warp speed. Almost like every gap in the conversation had been cut out to save time. Felt like Amy Sherman-Palladino was directing with rapid fire conversation like that.It got better as it went on, but like most mediocre action movie the characters were terrible and the plot did most of the leg work.I'll never watch this again."
Review of Tenet : Extremely confusing story compounded by terrible sound. The sound editing is the worst I have ever experienced. It's like the microphones were too far away from the actors when they filmed this movie. The dialogue is so inaudible at times that you need subtitles.Gave a 5 only because of the action sequences.
"Review of Tenet : Managed to stay with this movie right to the end, but it became a bit of a slog. Sure, some of the special effects were great, but my ability to follow the plot fell away about an hour before the end. I found myself scrolling through social media a few times due to boredom. The wife and kid angle was cliched in my opinion."
"Review of Tenet : The main actor is not great. Mumbles his words, his appearance doesn't fit in with the people he is dealing with and no class. Not a James Bond type at all. The story was confusing and and far too long to keep your attention. Not exciting and certainly not believable as far as the main actor went. I think it had the makings of a very good file if the casting had been different in the main roles. This turned out to be just a mess. I got to the point that I just couldn't watch it any further and turned it off. Could have been much better with some more experienced actors and
a better script. All in all very poorly done movie."
"Review of Tenet : So there comes a point in a film where you need to know roughly what's going on, in order to continue enjoying the film, even if it's been a bit confusing up until that point. This film just keeps getting more confusing and we end up with more questions than answers. This really left a dampener on our film experience.It feels like there are plot holes, but it's hard to say because the plot itself winds in and out of itself so many times that we don't know which is our head and which is our behind. There are moments where characters are having various meetings, but you can't really hear what they're saying. And that brings me to the audio. You can't hear the dialogue in this film. They did this on purpose no less! Read interviews, they apparently justified leaving the audience craning their necks to be able to understand the audio. Well, to me it's just dumb and it doesn't add anything good to the experience.Sorry Chris but this one is a swing and a miss for me."
"Review of Tenet : I don't get it, and I'm not talking about the mechanics of the movie here. I understand that. What I don't get is why people like this film so much. It's not a particularly unique story, the acting isn't good, and the plot feels weak.First, the story isn't unique. Sure, it plays a bit with time moving in both directions simultaneously rather than a Back-to-the-Future-type of linear time travel. But still. It doesn't feel like a fresh idea.The acting is frankly lackluster. I don't particularly like the Protagonist (John David Washington), nor the Antagonist (Kenneth Branagh, who I know for a fact is capable of more). The only good performances in the film come from Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki, but they're both underutilized in favor of focus on the Protagonist.The plot needs more support. I wouldn't say that it has holes, because I think that's fairly well covered, and that's something the film does well. But it seems like an afterthought (spoiler) to explain the true nature of the ""plutonium"" halfway through. Certain characters get virtually no development and are very one-dimensional. There are no real overarching themes - no critique of society or humanity, really nothing deeper than what you see on screen.Overall, a disappointment, especially given the overwhelmingly positive reviews it received. I wish it had been better."
"Review of Tenet : The action is more than needed. The whole mivie goes from actionacwne to the next. Lost track of the story halfway. Some things juat don't seem to be 'right'. They need to breathe special air byt almost at the end of the film they don't ... it could be I lost the explanation why because I lost interest halfway. Just wanted to see the movie from start til the end. For me not one I will see more times than one. As I said, a lot of things are cleverly thought but when it gets really interesting it also gets confusing because the rules do not comply anymore. So, if you just want a lot and really al lot of action without an interesting story try this one. If you want less action and a good story, don't."
"Review of Tenet : Nobody listened. This was the result. Sure, we get it, when some viewers make that special effort to ""understand"" the mad genius of the film-maker. Makes them feel special. But here is a tip from a member with 1600+ reviews. Like Seinfeld once said, if you choose your detergent based on its ability to remove bloodstains, you have bigger problems than laundry. If you need to watch the film several times, preferably with subtitles (quoting from one of the top rated reviews here), you are not here for the movie. Or the bear hunting.

"Review of Tenet : ""Tenet"" is the newest movie by British Oscar-nominated filmmaker Christopher Nolan, who is widely considered among the most defining and visionary film directors these days, also because he writes his own screenplays. He had his 50th birthday this year and as a gift for his fans, there is a new movie out and here we have it. It runs for 2.5 hours exactly pretty much and I must say sadly that this is among my least favorites from the Oscar-nominated director. I wonder if he will ever win one. Probably, but I can't see it happen for this film here. I also struggled a bit with his previous movie ""Dunkirk"" three years ago, but there I thought it was maybe partially because war films were never my favorite genre. But this one here, in the widest sense, has parallens with ""Inception"" and that is a film I really appreciated, more with each viewing, but then again, maybe I need to watch this one also once or twice in the future and maybe I will appreciate it more. I just cannot say I am motivated at all right now. This also has to do with the cast. Or at least with lead actor John David Washington, who is strangely enough not even close to being first credit here on imdb. I also felt that on his big breakthrough film by Spike Lee that almost had him nominated for an Oscar, he was not particularly good, so I still do not really see any lead actor potential in him. This movie here definitely did not change my mind.Then again, Nolan's films are almost always more about the magic of the story and the scientific aspect partially even, the other production values too, and not necessarily about really deep and meaningful characters. It is the case here again. Robert Pattinson is another good example. I definitely think he received a lot of unfair criticism for Twilight and he has been (unlike Lautner) in several good films in the last decade since these vampire films and given strong performances too. He is definitely an option for an Oscar nomination in the near future. But for this film here he felt almost completely wasted. I mean he had a lot of screen time, but barely any significance. The one who stood out a bit in terms of performances here was Kenneth Branagh showing us that he can play a Russian brute very well too. Talented actor and filmmaker without a doubt and his rough take on the role made his relationship with Debicki's character the most interesting component of the entire film perhaps. Debicki did what she had to do I would say, but she never really stood out either. Oh yes, Nolan regular Michael Caine, who is closing in on 90, gets his one scene as well again basically talking to the protagonist relatively early on just like it was the case with ""Inception"" too for him. No material to shine at all though. That's pretty much it with the cast. More familiar faces and names too for sure, but nobody really outstanding.As for the story, you are thrown right in the middle of it all with the concert hall scene. It is tense and brutal, but for me it was too fast and I would have preferred a little more introduction and explanation here. Let's be honest. If you did not know who the protagonist was, simply because JDW is kinda famous (like him or not), it would have felt even more pointless. The idea of the suicide pill being just a test is an interesting one though and also kinda makes sense that it was all staged because, let's be honest, the ""bad guys"" must be utter fools to let such a severely suffering prisoner give his pill to another one caught by them. Still, this was to me the first moment and inclusion that felt good. A lot of the story about travelling back in time, like literally physically back in time felt not depicted in a way where it convinced me. If we are gentle, we could say that Nolan's mind is still too great to make sense to general audiences, but if not, we could also say that his idea here was not good and interesting enough and more for the sake of being genius than actually being genius and that also a lot got lost in translation. I did like the really simple introduction scene to the concept though at the shooting range between the scientist and the protagonist. This was nice. But when they extended this concept to humans and a plot that is about saving the world, then it did not win me over unfortunately. Oh well, like I said, maybe I need to watch it again.Also the final moment between Washington's and Pattinson's characters where we find out they knew each other for a lot longer did not make much of an impact to me. At least not as much as I hoped because this beautiful friendship was supposed to be shown as one of the more emotional twists this film has to offer. I would say that judging from the absense of audible reactions from the crowd during my showing that most others were not really that impressed either. Or maybe I am being too harsh here and really need to rewatch to see if the one reviewer on the front page here is correct by saying that it feels like nothing special on the first viewing, but pretty great on rewatch. Still not motivated though and besides, I rarely tend to appreciate a movie more on television or a small screen than at a movie theater and I will definitely not go again as long as it is shown right now. The only reason that could kinda get me to would be Branagh's performance. Here Nolan proves again for me that he may not really be the best when it comes to truly emotional aspects away from action sequences. I am mostly talking about the talk referring to the female protagonist's son. Like when we hear from one character the world will be destroyed and then Debicki's character says something like that would mean her son dies too. A bit on the cringe side.I am kinda glad they did not elaborate more on a potential romance relationship between her and JDW's character because then things could have gotten really messy. The one scene with the talk about Branagh's antagonist character thinking they could have sex was enough already. Speaking of him, he also talks on one occasion about holes in the neck and what to fill them with. Okay, that was rough. And almost a bit of cult like from a Tarantino movie (where we indirectly could have seen it depicted on the screen even). I won't deny it. Rough, but entertaining. What you think about the terminal disease plot that got revealed later on and as a consequence about Branagh's character developing some kind of god complex is up to you. I thought it was right, but like I said, I believed almost everything about Branagh's character and performance here. It's okay if you think it was too much. The one thing I would not be okay with though is really people saying that this was a magnificent movie or (one of) Nolan's best. I thought it was too much on the underwhelming side for a positive recommendation even and I genuinely hope that the filmmaker can improve again with his upcoming projects. I mean he may have another 30 years in the industry and I refuse to believe that ""Tenet"" (spelled Tenet backwards too, definitely not a coincidence) and ""Dunkirk"" will be on the same level as everything he has coming up in the future or at least I don't want to believe. No need to challenge your audience this much, Chris, sometimes less is more. How about an animated movie for once?"
"Review of Tenet : If you plan to see this, you might be frustrated because following up the story is very hard. Maybe if you have an IQ higher than Einstein you could have a good picture of what's going on.Since I'm the average person, I just couldn't get it. Even when characters try to explain it only gets worse. The villain's wife is way more convincing. The villain, well, it seems a bit forced and not so authentic specially when he starts his monolog whispering at the mobile phone.The lead actor is a bad actor, and most times looks like he's reading lines instead of incorporating the character.Effects are interesting. Duration is exhausting, and it could be shorter."
"Review of Tenet : As a huge Nolan fan, I am very disappointed by this movie.You can feel that the goal of this film was simply to put the typical ""Nolan time games"" to the next level, make the film complicated. It is cool that Nolan films often have those ""mind blown"" moments, but that only works if you put that together with a good story. That is missing here.Also: the plot is not complicated, it's just badly told."
Review of Tenet : I would love to be able to give an opinion on this movie but unfortunately the background music was so loud that I couldn't make out a word the characters were saying. The beginning scene triggered my anxiety as I wasn't expecting that level of noise. No idea what this movie was about.
"Review of Tenet : The film gets very repetitive. The action is nothing but unnecessary chaos. The lead actor cant act for sure. His walking mannerism, his body language n his facial expressions r duds.
Better watch Terminator 2 or James Bond films.
The character of Priya n the shooting in Mumbai is added jus to attract pseudo intellectual viewers from my beloved country India.
The rote learned physics students from my beloved country will be in awe of this film.
Nolan aint aware that physics students in India need to work more in the laboratories to put the theoretical knowledge to use.
The wannabe critics from my country will unnecessary give this film more stars so that they dont look outcasts."
"Review of Tenet : The worst sound mixing of any film I've ever watched. My ears are actually ringing having come out of the cinema, the sound effects were that loud. Half the time, especially in the first half of the film, I couldn't hear what anyone was saying because random background noises were louder than the speech. I've checked with others who saw it in different cinemas and they've said similar. The story is overly convoluted, and the characters have no depth. There was some redeeming features - the action sequences do have some good moments, and I do feel like rewatching it but only to better understand it all. However overall, even the sound issues aside, it wasn't an enjoyable watch, and I can't imagine it would be a second time round."
Review of Tenet : Wanted to enjoy it. At the end realised I really hadn't grasped that much of the film although some of the action scenes were well done (if you ignored the people in the background going the wrong way at various points).Almost seems like Nolan was showing off with this one.
"Review of Tenet : ""Tenet"" is a Christopher Nolan film that came out in the middle of COVID...so it didn't get the sort of theatrical release you'd expect. In fact, it very quickly came to cable and DVD.The story is a very difficult one to both explain and connect with as you watch. It involves some sort of secret agent and his mission to somehow stop someone from sending items through time. Obviously some evil persons from the future and some from the present are in league together. What is NOT obvious is pretty much everything else about the movie! It is incredibly ambiguous and annoying...much of which is because you really have no idea who the 'Protagonist' (John David Washington) is working for, who he is or, well, pretty much ANYTHING about him. Calling him 'Protagonist' throughout the movie really heightens this problem.In many ways, this is much like the rest of the story...vague and detached. As a result, it was very difficult to connect with anyone nor care about them. All you are left with are some insane stunts and a lot of action...and, oddly, an amazingly boring film. I really wanted to like this one...but it just felt as if the film wasn't meant to be enjoyed by most folks...just the few."
"Review of Tenet : Although this was victimized by COVID, even after an impressive pre-release marketing campaign, the film is just not that good. A classic B-movie with an A-level budget, frenetic (bordering on incoherent) editing and a silly spin on searching for horcruxes (reference intended), the moebius strip time spin just didn't really work. Maybe the bonding agents are on the editing room floor somewhere, but I'm sure the book not based on the movie is much for fulfilling and illuminates the internal workings of the characters beyond ""save my child"" and ""I hate life so I'm taking everyone with me"". This is comic book level stuff for a work alleging to be of substance. The character motivations are ridiculously thin and cliched. Much of the monotone dialogue lacks punch and vitality. For all the pretension, this is nothing more than smoke and mirrors."
"Review of Tenet : This film was originally intended to be released in mid-July 2020, but was delayed to 31 July, until finally being released in August, this is due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing all cinemas to close during the lockdown. I saw the five minute footage trailer back in March, and I was most interested to see it on the big screen, so thank goodness cinemas eventually reopened (with guidelines and safety measures), and I went to see this. The dictionary definition of ""tenet"" is ""any opinion, principle, doctrine, dogma, etc., especially one held as true by members of a profession, group, or movement"", I just knew it was a blockbuster that loads of people, including me, were keen to see, written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception, Dunkirk). Basically, an unnamed Protagonist (John David Washington, Denzel's son), a CIA agent posing as a Ukrainian policeman, participates in an undercover Russian operation to steal an unidentified object during a terrorist siege on an opera house in Kyiv. During the chaos, the Protagonist is saved by a masked gunman using time-reversing technology. The Russians turn on the CIA members and torture the Protagonist, but he bites a suicide pill before to avoid revealing any information. The Protagonist wakes, learning that the pill was fake, and that all his team members were caught and killed by the Russians, and they have got the unidentified object. The Protagonist is recruited into a secret organisation seeking to track down the origin of ""inverted"" objects, which move backward through time, using future technology sent back into the past. Investigating inverted bullets, the Protagonist is assisted by Neil (Robert Pattinson) to infiltrate the compound of an arms dealer, Priya (Dimple Kapadia). She directs them towards Russian oligarch Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh). To reach Sator, the Protagonist approaches Sator's wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). The Protagonist experiences the inverted technology during an operation, involving a plane crashed the storage facility in Oslo Airport, where he fights a regular masked man. Neil unmasks and releases his opponent, then stops the Protagonist from killing the inverted opponent, who escapes. Priya explains that the facility contained a time inversion device. Kat arranges for the Protagonist to meet Sator, who the Protagonist saves Sator from Kat's murder attempt. Sator reveals that information sent from the future had contributed to his wealth. The Protagonist offers to steal the object that Sator had been seeking, in exchange that Kat will be freed. After the Protagonist and Neil steal the object from an armoured car in transport, an inverted Sator confronts them, holding Kat hostage to obtain the object. Neil calls in the secret organisation's time-inverting troops to assist. Time inversion devices are used by Sator and the Protagonist and they battle for possession of the object, with Sator ultimately prevailing; and Kat is severely wounded with an inverted bullet. To save Kat from death, the Protagonist and Neil join her in inverted time, but they require the device in Oslo Airport to un-invert in the past. They infiltrate the airport, using the plane crash as a distraction: the masked man the Protagonist previously encountered was actually his future self. The un-inversion is successful. Priya explains that the crucial object is part of a future-developed ""algorithm"" capable of catastrophically inverting the entire world. The algorithm was sent into the past to prevent its use in the future, leading to human extinction from climate change. Kat reveals Sator's motive: he is dying from inoperable cancer and believes that the world should die with him. Sator has the algorithm and travels to a time in the past when he was most happy, where he plans to die peacefully and activate the algorithm. He is followed by Kat and the time-inverting secret organisation. Kat will delay Sator's death in Vietnam, while troops attack a Soviet closed city to retrieve the algorithm. Kat kills Sator prematurely, but the Protagonist and Neil retrieve the algorithm in time. During the retrieval, the Protagonist is saved by a masked corpse who springs back to life inverted. The organisation plans to separately hide the algorithm's components. As Neil and the Protagonist part ways, Neil reminisces about their long partnership, revealing that the future version of the Protagonist had recruited Neil in Neil's past. The Protagonist notices that Neil has a red string on his backpack, like that who saved him in the opera house. Neil insists he must continue his mission, intending to invert time. In London, Priya attempts to kill Kat to tie up loose ends. Instead, the Protagonist kills Priya, and implies that a future version of himself will be the mastermind behind all of the secret organisation's actions. Also starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ives, Himesh Patel as Mahir, Michael Caine as Michael Crosby, and Fiona Dourif (Brad's daughter) as Wheeler. Washington is reasonable as the lead, Pattinson is fine, Branagh is suitably hammy as the villain, and there is almost point in Caine being in the film, being in a single and very short scene. A character asks, ""Does your head hurt yet?"" to another, that is exactly the feeling you are going have watching this film. You cannot deny that the special effects, editing, and sound design are fantastic to make spectacular scenes with explosions, gunfire and crashes seen reversing and going forward, sometimes in the same scene. The problem is, it is pretty much impossible to try and work out what the hell is going on, it is trying to be too clever that it almost forgets about the audience watching. It's not quite what I had in mind as the first film to watch returning to the cinema, lol. I really wanted to follow and understand it, but it is just too confusing, I admit that I fell asleep at one point, a visually fantastic but mind-boggling science-fiction action thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Ludwig Göransson. Okay, in my opinion!"
"Review of Tenet : If you're looking for a nice movie to go out and enjoy, pass on this one. I don't know why it was made so unnecessarily difficult. I literally got a headache watching this. I get it was time travel and the overall general plot, but why did they have to make everything so vague. This is not a movie, this is a puzzle AND YOU BEST BET THAT NOBODY HAS TIME FOR THAT!! HARD PASS.
I'll give it 4 for the effort and the good quality cinematography"
"Review of Tenet : I'm sorry but maybe I just like to watch movies that make sense and I don't have to go through copious amounts of theory videos afterward to make some sort of sense of the movie. It was obviously a movie aimed at pompous intellectuals who stand around drinking expensive wine and debating papers they have written on sexual identity. Sadly that is not me! There is a reason that only one person attacks at a time in action movies, because the audience can't follow too many things at once. This movie is proof!"
"Review of Tenet : Crap movie, zero emotional movement, no character development, pointless dialogue. One big spectacle used to hide it's glaring flaws. It's complexity is a farce to hide it's illogical inconsistencies while trying to force the spectator to splash more cash on wasted repeated viewings. It was like the director had zero interest in actually giving the audience a good experience but rather wanted them to admire his ""craft skills"".There was no synchronicity between the protagonist and the plot and zero emotional stakes. Ask yourself this, what actually was driving the main protagonist? Why does it matter to him? You could have replaced the main character with any other personality, flaws, drive and the movie would not have been affected one iota.And the antagonist?!? Tell me again his motivation for causing world war 3? And why did this have to involve inversion again? And what is the use of an antagonist or a protagonist when the latter just literally fights himself just so he can fight himself to stop himself from stopping himself just so he can achieves nothing which somehow allows the protagonist to achieve something which actually doesn't accomplish anything. So the antagonist literally achieved more against himself than the protagonist. So who was whose worse enemy??!? AND tell me again what the protagonist was actually trying to do again? This is what the modern world calls ""deep"".Tenet's ""complexity"" is nothing but a cheap trick to make dumb reviewers and moviegoers applaud a movie at their own expense. Any person with common sense would realise the emperor is wearing no clothes.Why pay for something and fall for a director's clever yet completely egotistical mindgame to make pawns of you and your wallets? This movie spits in the face of all the actually good complex movies of the past that actually had something to say and most importantly elevated it's audience beyond its own medium. There is literally nothing to take home from Tenet... It is just loud empty noise and will pass like a fart in the wind."
"Review of Tenet : Couple of problems. Didn't enjoy the movie. Lacked clarity and despite it being a fantasy the often overused factual science errors made it cheaply implausible. Actors chosen seemed dull, lifeless; not believable. The overall theme of someone in the future traveling to the past (our present) is (a.) not possible; period (b.) to destroy this past (our present) so that there is no future seemed absurd (duh, future us there are easier ways). Although, at the rate we're going with our environmental destruction we're doing it well enough on our own. Didn't get the plutonium angle as it's easy to get a small amount for a single bomb. However, not explained in the movie, but building the fissionable bomb apparatus is no walk in the park. The nine containers of code made no sense. Just an excessively complex script that should have adhered to the KISS principle.
On a positive note extra star for the background to the movie as explained in the special features - the intricacies & expense to create the scenes was more fascinating than the movie. Also, all the site locations: Estonia; Italy; U.K.; Denmark; India; Norway."
Review of Tenet : Starts With a great expectation and ends with a great disappointment 😞...
"Review of Tenet : This movie could have set a benchmark like matrix and change the movies like it did forever, but unfortunately its a hot mess, hard to follow/keep up. Granted it pushes your minds limits but not like matrix, which you could understand even watching it once (maybe not all of it but still) Tenet, you need to study it to understand it, and that makes me bored. Unlike matrix it looses its charm once you see it or as soon as you figure out the twist, and i dont have the desire to see it again. Whereas the more you watch matrix the more you want to watch it again."
"Review of Tenet : I watched Tenet...And then, finally, I watched Tenet with subtitles, because it's on Netflix, thinking I would enjoy it more...I did not.Sure, I had better access to the exposition, which is fine, but the grander plot was no more sensible than when I first watched, Sam's subtitles.In brief, Tenet is far less clever than it imagines itself.Time travel is complicated, certainly, proven by the fact that we haven't yet accomplished it. The best time travel movies establish their loose rules, then dance to Chuck Berry tunes, because time travel logic can never adhere to itself. Back To The Future and Avengers: Endgame succeed despite their failures. That is, ""Let's get on with the rest of the plot, because this time travel thing is never going to stand up to scrutiny.""Tenet is a film that has no other plot to move on to, because it is entirely concerned with making its non-logic logical.I imagine that writer-director Christopher Nolan lost precious sleep because he convinced himself that he could concoct a perfect time travel MacGuffin... but in doing so he sacrificed any kind of narrative that the audience could invest itself in.Marty McFly saves his family. Tony Stark gets the Infinity Stones and palavers with his dad. Sarah Connor goes to the playground... these popcorn moments don't exist in Tenet.Nolan has inserted his head so far up his own bottom, trying to concoct a logical time travel narrative, that he forgot to include a fun adventure.His greatest failing, however, is that his time travel dynamics don't stand up to scrutiny... and the dull mess he's left behind make even less sense than when Marty McFly woke up to a family of happy, succesful siblings.I mean... did some contractor actually build Freeport facilities using pre-shot glass?"
"Review of Tenet : I usually love SF so was looking forward to this - but I have no idea what the point of this was ..... some kind of SF in the style of James Bond ?I found the ""inverted"" sequences hard to follow and impossible to track whether they actually made sense within the rules of this story. Many reviews say you will get them after 2-4 viewings, which brings me to the problem within that - at no point did I feel invested in any character, the film totally failed to hold my attention and I arrived at the 2 hour 30 minute point with a feeling of huge relief.There is no way I am investing 5-20 hours in the hope of understanding this !"
Review of Tenet : Tenet was a film only the writer could understand I'm sure it played out well in Nolan's head but on the big screen was a mess . The music and sound effects far too loud . Didn't care for any of the characters? What was the plot ?. If you're a casual movie goer . Definitely do not watch this .
"Review of Tenet : The entire premise falls on its face it you think about it too much. It's an interesting concept but it doesn't work no matter how much you hand wave. You're either going forward in time, or you're going backwards in time, but you can't do both. Sometimes they hear backwards talk from people going the other direction, but sometimes people going different directions in time can still have a ""forward"" conversation and drive next to each other in cars. It's ridiculous."
"Review of Tenet : Sadly nothing like the brilliant Memento or Inception. Loud, shouty, macho, overlong - and ridiculously violent for a film that's somehow got a 12 certificate. No, no and no - this is very much a 15. But mainly I just stopped caring if who / when / how, and found myself just checking my watch to try and work out where in the narrative arc weight possibly be so I knew how much more energy I needed to get through to the end. And just because you the Director are enjoying the coolly clever concept of simultaneously forward/reversed action sequences, that doesn't mean it wouldn't have been better with tighter editing. We got it - it was loud and clever. There were lots of explosions. Yes, ok, we got it. All very clever. Just stop it now!"
"Review of Tenet : Poor cast choice, weak and chaotic plot with some action scenes really boring, looking like underdeveloped, plus trivial dialogs. Mediocre production.
This time travel theme is so ridiculous and pseudoscientific that it's impossible to follow the narrative with full engagement because everything got its sense only if you blindly accept what the movie is trying to tell you, there is a huge lack of logical consequences.Also it looks like there is something wrong with sound effects, music is too loud. Basically Nolan made this film in a big rush. Protagonist as well as antagonist are really boring, hackneyed early Bond movies-like characters, nothing like Craig, Bale, or Ledger or Hardy."
"Review of Tenet : On paper, Tenet should have been as good as Interstellar and Inception. There are definitely similarities between these Nolan films - which in itself is not a bad thing as you know you're in for a challenging interesting and visually amazing experience. But there are 3 differences between Tenet and those films:
1. The cast and performances in Tenet are weak, and you just don't care about any of them. Washington's character just wasn't interesting and was pretty boring. Basic film making = make characters you can care about.
2. The dialogue is fast and quiet (the background sound is way too dominant) so within the first 20 minutes you're already not following what's going on. It's not the viewers responsibility to watch a film 3 times because the sound production dept can't do their job.
3. Visually boring. There was a blandness about many of the sets. Remember the Japanese house at the start on Inception? And the ""sea world"" in Interstellar? Tenet lacks imagination and everything looks boring.
4. Complexity in itself doesn't make a film interesting. Tenet is just too complex and isn't worth it. It's a quzzle you don't care if you don't solve. There are lots of film that don't lay everything on a plate for the viewer (e.g. Enemy, 2001 Space Oddisy etc) but they're WORTH it.For the first time ever, I nearly walk out half way through. I endured to the end and was glad it was over.I'm genuinely surprised that there are so many 10/10 rating for this. I'm pretty good at following complex films but Tenet is just tediously complex.There are some good things about Tenet (Pattinson and Brannagh's performances), but overall, Tenet is poor."
"Review of Tenet : Chaotic and confusing right from the start.The main character is caught by Russians at the start but what were they actually doing in the operah house?Very hard to follow what is going on, very complicated fictional science going on that they take no time to properly explain and the end fight scene, the bad guys are fighting the good guys because they all want the whole world to end, including themselves? Hard to believe.The main characters love interest is just so hard to believe, there is zero chemistry between them.One of the worst movies I have ever watched and I normally love Nolan films."
"Review of Tenet : ... and still boring as hell. How can get this one 5+ stars?The idea might be there, but I don't seem to get it. Switched to another flic and didn't regret."
"Review of Tenet : Tenet is unnecessary confusing and a hard to follow movie. Nolan's obsession with time is translated on screen in a very messy and overcomplicated way. Characters lack depth, they have no background story, main character doesn't have a name, at no point during the movie have i developed any emotional connection with any of the characters nor did i care for them, which is not a good thing for a movie that's trying to create tension and suspense by putting their lives on the line more than once, story is either too slow or too fast, and the voice audio levels are way too low to the point you can't hear anything that's being said. Previous Christopher Nolan movies that had layers of complexity, like Inception or Interstellar were despite of that very easy to watch, same cannot be said for Tenet which seems like a culmination of Nolan's game with time which is present in most of his movies, from Memento, Inception, Interstellar, even Dunkirk, issue with Tenet is that unlike those movies, Tenet seems to be directed and written by Christopher Nolan for only one viewer in mind, that viewer being Christopher Nolan himself, the consequence of that is a movie that is by far his weakest, and probably only bad movie he's ever directed."
Review of Tenet : I'm a massive Nolan fan and love Inception which I was hoping this was going to be like but it's nothing of the sort and very poor! The story isn't that complex once you finally find out what's happening but for a Nolan film I expected far better.
"Review of Tenet : This summer, in anticipation of the release of Tenet, I wrote a piece defending the position of Christopher Nolan as not merely a filmmaker of huge commercial clout, but as someone whose quality of work on an artistic, cinematographic, and emotional (yes, I wrote that!) level merits proper appreciation too. I did post a warning though that Nolan's increasing reverence for tech and his control freak tendencies were threatening to outweigh that lovely dichotomy he had always been able to blend between all things genre and his metaphysically-inflected narratives.With Tenet, Nolan totally oversteps that line and has turned in a work that runs dangerously close to self-satire. While I would argue his previous ten films have always possessed some portion of an emotional edge amid the viscerality of their storytelling, Tenet is, simply, a spectatorial dead weight. It is completely lacking in tension and is just a film endlessly stuck in the cycle of explaining and justifying itself and its conceit (perhaps an unintended, ironic echo of its central theme of inversion). Copious exposition is nothing new to a Nolan film, but comprehensiblity and an emotional core always co-existed with that philosophical bent. Even Memento - a film which loosely echoes the tricks of Tenet with a focus on a narrative being played in reverse - was able to conjure three-dimensional character arcs out of those thematics. In Tenet, however, the characters remain (unintentionally) flat, which is borne out when the Protagonist's climactic conversation with Neil and his one last look at Kat don't carry the dramatic pay-off Nolan is clearly angling for.Even in Nolan's lesser guise as a purveyor of spectacle, Tenet falls flat. For all the lustre, gravitas and awe Nolan applies to his action sequences (I'm thinking about the exploding jumbo, the billionaire's yacht, the racing boats), he's unable to aestheticise these for his audience the way his idol, Michael Mann, can. It's because Mann's action scenes are always connected to the ethics and emotion of his stories, whereas Nolan's function as extraneous gorging on extreme financial, technological and industrial might."
"Review of Tenet : There was a time when I was a huge Nolan fan. The Prestige is still one of my all time favorite top ten movies. Yet the more movies Nolan makes, the more the luster wears off.Most of of Nolan's movies have some psuedo-science schtick you're asked to take with a leap of faith. Tesla's machine in Prestige. The gravity beings in Interstellar. Matroshyka dreams in Inception. See the pattern here? At his best Nolan is a supremely polished Abrams or Rian Johnson: more interested in advancing his vision than offering substance.Tenet is not his best.A review I read said that Tenet's problem is that Nolan has reached a level where he doesn't have to listen to anyone -- there's no one to pull him back and tell him something isn't working. Tenet is that ultimate conceit.It's a time-jinx movie that only explains half the rules... and then breaks all of them. Inversion is a gimmick that's used masterfully exactly ONCE. The rest of the time it's just smoke and mirrors to distract you from the fact that there is no reason to the movie, that it's characters are cardboard thin, the dialog is terrible, and at it's heart it's just a cerebral wannab-Bond flick that doesn't get the cerebral part right.Congrats, Mr. Nolan. You lived long enough to see yourself become the villain."
"Review of Tenet : Being a huge Nolan fan I anticipated this release. I think everyone of his films (exluding the mediocre third batman) is a masterpiece. Unfortunately this time he got everything wrong. First of all the script, though based on an interesting idea, is all over the place. Nothing is explained or completed. I struggled for the first hour to understand what is happening and then I stopped caring. And that brings us to the second fault. There are no characters, only puppets with no backstory or evolvment arc, muttering Nolan's ideas like ""text to voice"" wikipedia. The music is very annoying, most of the time covering the actors voices. The actors try to do their best with what the were given which is not much. Well...with the exception of the completely talentless protagonist. Hope this mess is the only low point in Nolan's filmography."
"Review of Tenet : This movie is in short, way too long, way too complicated, to the point where i left an everyman cinema. Its tried to be too clever for its own good, and the plots are plentiful but not explained as the movie moves through so many.
The fight scenes are awful.
The acting is at best average, and some of the dialogues are just garbage and childish nonsense.
Paid 15 quid at the everyman cinema, best bit was the icecream sunday i ordered."
"Review of Tenet : What a big disappointment. The director likes complex films but this time he didn't know when to stop.The problem with this movie is the concept dominates everything. In so many scenes you are left trying to keep track of the inversion of time effects that it distracts from the drama.Yes, you can follow this movie's plot if you pay attention. I soon found that it was tiresome, in the way that I found the old Rubric's Cubes tiresome. Sure you can do it, but is it worth it? This one sure isn't worth the 2.5 hours needed."
"Review of Tenet : I am reviewing this movie after one watch and I have to say I quite liked it, and I do think I understood most of the key premises. I may have missed a few of the smaller details, which I hopefully will pick up on a re-watch. However, I went with two other people who did not get this movie and absolutely hated it. This is why you have to give this movie your full attention, because if not you will lose track of what is happening and be miserable for the next two hours. Also, I am an American and native English speaker, so I don't know how difficult it would be to watched this movie subtitled or dubbed. I like foreign movies, but I do know the negative of missing a line of dialogue, camera set-up, or movement from an actor because you have to so quickly read the subtitles. This causes me to be afraid that you will miss a lot if you are from a non-english speaking country, but I hope this is not the case.
""Tenet"" is both a philosophical science fiction movie and a complex thriller. I would say this makes it harder to understand than previous Nolan movies such as ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception,"" because those movies had traits of being a super-hero or heist movie which are genres audiences are more familiar with.
I think I am done talking about the complexities and would like to talk about the pros of this movie. The cast, except for Brannagh who is good not great, does a really good job with making characters with very little characterization, which is a con I will talk about, feel real. An example of this is some of Washington's humor. He is not a funny character, but he makes some smart aleck responses which makes his cold character feel more human. Overall, Washington and Pattinson were very good casting choices. Another pro is the choreography. This movie's action scenes are incredibly unique and the spectacle of seeing them are amazing. A subject related to this is Nolan's use of motion/blocking in a frame. Nolan as a director has a lot of movement in his scenes, whether they be actions or exposition scenes, which makes exposition scenes, which there are several of, be much more interesting than they would be by a lesser director. The payoffs of this movie. I would say there are scenes from earlier in this movie that you end up appreciating a lot more about 2/3rds of the way through, which makes me appreciate the earlier scenes a lot more.
The cons. I don't like being negative and I do like that Nolan is making blockbusters that are nothing like any other blockbusters around, but ""Tenet"" does have a few flaws. The characterization, I praised the cast earlier, but I think they did a great job with the little amount of character they had. The script gives very little time to the characters to allow them develop as people. Mainly because, it is so focused on moving the plot forward. I do think that the movie could have been a little bit better if it added about 15 minutes of characterization besides the plot, so we could care more about the characters in the epic situations they are in. The sound is a major problem. You may read other reviews criticizing the sound, and these views are correct. The sounder mixer and Nolan put too much emphasis on the sound effects and score. This leads to you being unable to hear the dialogue at points. This is a real negative because the dialogue is so important. I am younger and my hearing is probably better than the average person's, but if you are in your forties, fifties, or older this may be a real problem which SHOULD have been avoided. I am hoping that this problem will be re-mixed either while it is still in theatres or before it goes onto blu-ray and digital, because it is inexcusable. My final con is that it is too big at times. ""Tenet"" is one of the most massive movies of all time. It is up there with ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Ran,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and ""Avengers: Endgame."" This leads to there being great spectacle, but sometimes it is a little too much. I will give a non-spoiler example. There is a scene where Washington does pull-ups inside a windmill, at a deadly height if he falls. I get what this scene is saying in terms of his character, but sometimes just how huge it is separates us from the characters.
I'm impressed if you are still reading this, but don't worry I will end it soon. I hated going on about the cons for so long, because I really liked this movie. I like Nolan as a director, but I was really disappointed in ""Interstellar"" and ""Dunkirk,"" but I would re-watch ""Dunkirk"" to see if I like it more (I have watched ""Interstellar"" twice and just was never into it). ""Tenet"" was the first time for awhile that I felt I was watching the incredible Nolan who made ""The Dark Knight Trilogy."" So, please I understand if you don't watch this in theatres because of the pandemic, I felt really nervous and went to a Wednesday showing. However, whenever you can watch it and feel safe, please don't be scared off because you heard from a friend or the internet that this is complicated, this movie really deserves a watch."
"Review of Tenet : I originally rated it 7 and thought I would like it more on a second watch... And after all the hype i had faded i did... And man I realized it's a horrible boring movie, cringy villain with cringy female character who does everything without any point other than to move the plot forward, the main idea gets dull pretty quickly and pretty impossible to understand fully.. Man after i liberated from all the hype i had the first time i realized how ridiculous and boring this soap opera was... I actually got mad that this was a freaking Nolan film.. The only guy I wait for his movies along with Tarantino... I'm so so so disappointed...
(edit) : if you guys don't believe me.. Let me tell somethings about the movie....
"" nuclear holocaust?...-worst"".....omg.. What?... ""if i can't have you no one will.""...cringing bad... "" i will do anything for my son""... Including killing the guy and causing the end of freakin humanity.... "" don't try to understand it""... Well there you go... Nolan says f you to your face....
Omg this movie is so bad... I can't blame the actors they kinda carried the whole thing and John David Washington would make a good James Bond.. They had to deal with immensely bad writing, script and characters... Nolan did a pretty bad job and made this movie for his own amusement and be we like him we hyped to it... An identical thing happened with Tarantino and once upon a time in Hollywood.. My two favorite movie makers went nuts"
"Review of Tenet : There is supposed to be some underlying story line about an unobtanium type of material that makes things go backwards. People for the future are coming to the past to do stuff. Why one would ask - if your from the future you know what has happened - so what is the point?Brings up the next question, what is the point of this movie?I was completely lost - if there was a plot, I couldn't find it. There is soft spot in my heart for time paradox files, but all I got out of this was a headache.The characters were plastic, wading through the script like it was molasses. Incidentals such as why things were happening the way they were glossed over, ignored or simply left to the view to figure out for themselves. Sometimes it is good that the director puts forward a question that leaves the viewer something to ponder over, usually a deep moral question or existential issues that tickle the amateur philosopher in all of us.In Tenet, the questions are more like - what is going here? Where did that character come from? Why are they doing this? This make no sense - and so on. Don't bother watching. I tried to get through it but gave up 3/4 of the way through, it was just a dogs breakfast of action sequences, bad acting and incompressible storytelling."
"Review of Tenet : Whoever mixed the audio for this movie is incompetent. First time in a long time I've had to constantly turn the sound up and down. The dialog is a level 5, the sound effects are a level 20."
"Review of Tenet : This is my kind of movie, which is weird because after watching it I wished I hadn't.Absurd backwardness that is difficult to follow due to muffled voices and other sound related issues.A waste of time."
"Review of Tenet : Boring, confusing, plot holes, bad acting, unnecessarily soppy."
"Review of Tenet : I love MOST Christopher Nolan movies, but Tenet was bad. Really bad. It made about as much sense as a Joe Biden speech. The action sequences were just ok. The music was 112 decibels louder than the speech, which was muffled 75% of the time by a mask. The dialogue was like trying to understand the crazy brother portrayed by Tom Hardy in Legend, while the crazy brother was wearing scuba gear.It was not thought provoking like Inception, as the only thought I had was ""When will this be over?"" And ""Why isn't that weird vampire guy sparkling in this movie?"".Please, please, please don't turn Christopher Nolan into another Quentin Tarantino, where you give his movies 10 stars regardless of how bad it is. Your blind, sheeplike reviews just cost me $90 at the theater."
Review of Tenet : You shouldn't need to rewatch a film in order to understand it.
Review of Tenet : Great opening scene. Great photography and effects. Terrible plot.Bad Continuity. Preposterous through and through and inhibited by bad acting. Yes Superfly and Dracula cant save this.
"Review of Tenet : I don't remember seeing people rushing to leave the cinema this quickly since The Matrix sequels.After the first 5 minutes I lost track of what I was watching.
After 10, I stopped understanding why the story mattered.
After 15 minutes, I became genuinely disinterested.
... 135 minutes to go.What the hell happened?!?!IMO the main culprit was actually not the poor sound mixing, but the astonishingly bad LIGHTING. And SCRIPT.Tenet was the least well lit movie I have ever seen. With all its budget, it should have felt lush and vibrant, but instead felt cold as ice and just plain boring to watch.It's unfortunate how not good this movie is:
VISIONARY DIRECTOR - overstepping the boundary between understandable/relatable and incoherent/irrelevant.
COMPETENT ACTORS - not given much of a dialogue/story to work with
GREAT LOCATIONS - not utilised by poor editing, lighting and uninspired cinematography.Tenet wasn't painfully unpleasant to watch, but just barely. It's only outstandingly redeeming/memorable quality was that the villain was planning his own suicide. But even that was only hinted at and not explored. Like, at all.Yes."
"Review of Tenet : Couldn't understand half the words because the soundtrack and sound design covered up the dialogue. The backwards fighting looked cool but no idea how or why it was happening because I couldn't hear anything. And I got the feeing I was meant to like the main guy, but once again....this next level Bane sound design and covering up people's mouths when they talk made me not know what the hell was going on. Also, there were cool visual elements calling back to different story points with the whole time manipulation thing, but once again, I had no idea what anyone was saying so I had idea what was going on. Muddy muddy muddy sound. Can I invert my experience of watching this please?"
"Review of Tenet : Only Dunkirk was somewhat impressive out of Nolan's last many disasters, and even the story in that film was severely lacking to say the least. However at least it was an entertaining film, and I understood the story because I had already seen the old original film. This guy has completely lost his mind as a filmmaker. The kids still seem to love everything he touches ever since he made that constipated Batman trilogy. Bored nerds is the only way I can explain it. I'm going to go on record here and say that Sylvester Stallone's 1980's cheesefest action flick Cobra, was a far smarter film than this one. Seriously though, who the hell could ever even consider that this story would make for a good film? I'm at a loss. I'm giving this film a 3 out of 10 and honestly, that's pretty generous. I think I gave Cobra the same rating.3/10"
"Review of Tenet : You go through a curve of understanding with this film. This review contains mild spoilers, however I wouldn't really regard them as spoilers because they are all in the trailer and the ""twist/reveal"" is so incredibly obvious nearly everyone will pick up on it before it even comes into fruition on first viewing.The first time you watch it its extremely unlikely you will understand the majority of the film. You will enjoy it, the action sequences will blow you away, you will unfortunately be slightly deaf for a day or two afterwards, and you will be frustrated with the indeciperhable dialogue for a good 20% of the film. In general though, you will have a blast, 9/10.The second time you will watch it you will get a much better understanding of the ending, and you will be able to ""combine"" the plot together much better, you will start to question if the audio issues, especially in the Freeport exposition sequence and the second chamber sequence are done deliberately? You will still however not understand the car sequence, no chance. 8/10.The third time you watch it you will now pretty much fully understand it, and you will then start to realise bits of it unfortunately dont make sense by the films own rules, or even completely ignore the rules for the sake of plot. In addition you will realise that ultimately the relationship between the Protagonist and Kat doesnt make any sense whatsoever, why would he even care? which kinda rips a lot of sense out of the whole thing, and also that in reality you dont really care about literally any of the cast at all. Also you will come to the conclusion that Sators ultimate reason for his evil plan is really weak on the ground and doesn't really make any sense. 6/10The fourth time you watch it you realise that at least half of the film doesnt actually make sense at all, as in... definitely not. There are 3 absolutely massive issues all in the name of special effects: The guy going backwards through the wall doesnt work (the building would of needed to of been built around him, or the wall itself needs to be reversed, in both cases impossible), Neil cannot be alive in the cage at the end at all, even in reverse, and if he dies in reverse what happens to the body? The car cannot be reversed, at all. Its impossible. (it wont even fit in the time chamber). The bullet in the opera house is reversed, and causes damage in real time. The holes in the window in the Freeport chamber are already there in realtime, before the bullets are fired, and then when the gun is fired in reverse time it heals the bullets in real time. You cannot have both. Its either one or the other. 4/10The fifth time you watch it you will see completely past the special effects and sequences that make no sense to core issues with the film, not even the time manipulation aspect, the actual plot itself and the characters in it. At the end Kat could of quite easily just Tranquillised or knocked out Sator - problem solved, this renders the entirety of the rest of the film completely null and void, and this course of action makes far, far more sense than what they actually do. The complete lack of character building for every character with the exception of Sator/Kat, the whole ""TeneT"" gesture/word setup gets used... once. We never understand the organisation, or even why the entire ""test"" at the start is even necessary, if they were trying to keep it secret the whole concept is so ridiculous that if anyone did defect and try to tell an authority they would just think you were completely mad, and on top of that you could easily just reverse yourself and kill the defector before they defect. There is no need for the secret TeneT organisation at all, whatsoever. Why the hell was the indian arms dealer woman in the car outside the school at the end? Literally ridiculous. And so on, and so on... the more you think about it... 3/10I'm conclusion;
You never get this with Interstellar, you never get this with Inception. TeneT drops into the ""Memento"" category, where the film is ""enjoyably confusing"" to watch the first time round, however on subsequent viewing you come to realise that it cant even stand on its own two feet (the memento case being that its impossible for him to remember that he has no memory. Once you take this into account that film is also, completely ridiculous.)Nolan has MacGuffins in all of his films, gimmicks really, sometimes they work very well (inception sleep device in briefcase, interstellar forth dimension) however most of the time they just don't work at all and are actually plot destructively bad (batman begins water boiling device, memento remembering total memory loss, prestige cloning device). TeneT fits into the latter of the two categories.I give it 3/10 because ultimately, its a feat of cinematography just to even make the damn thing materialise on screen. However thats it. The characters are poor, the plot is frankly terrible, the concept is cool but totally flawed, the sound design is abysmal, the dialogue is crap (theres only two memorable piece of dialogue in the entire film), the music has one good theme, the other music in the film is unremarkable or jarring.The film says ""Dont try to understand it, feel it"" - On first viewing I thought it was a cool line, on my fifth and final viewing it comes across as a disclaimer."
"Review of Tenet : I'm not going to mix my words when it comes to ""Tenet"", its horrible.The script is, in my opinion, an incoherent mess, with a story line that defies reason and logic. Of course there's no fixing this core failing, so the train wreck just grows bigger and uglier, as this rather tedious tale unfolds. Or is that ""infolds"".Acting is mostly reasonable but the bad Russian character, in particular, is a Western mainstream media cliche. A misogynistic boogeyman, who might just destroy the world. If you can't read between the lines there, then you might not have been watching the MSM's current take on Russia. Not that I would blame you.Sets are expensive and special effects are above average. That said, there's not a lot going on under the hood, so to speak, so that really doesn't fix this film in a meaningful way.In short, if this one leaves you feeling confused its not you, its the story or perhaps the overall absence of one.3/10 from me."
"Review of Tenet : This movie was complete and utter drivel. It was one of those films that likes to think that it's so smart, that it's going to have you intrigued and dancing in circles trying to figure out what's going on. Oh, what does this mean? Oh, what just happened? Oh, wait a minute I don't think I'm quite keeping up with this ridiculously clever plot.Actually, it was quite the opposite that happened. It simply got to the point where you stop caring and I know that when I get to the point where I stopped caring whether or not the world survives, then I've become completely indifferent to a story. This film was simply too clever, it was too complex, it was too over-the-top, it was too Hollywood. It felt like a $200 million comic book.It was stupid, it was mindless, this film made me feel numb, this film made me feel nothing. I felt no emotional connection to any of the characters. I literally didn't care whether or not the world survived!Terrible effort, guys. A miserable flop. A total mess."
"Review of Tenet : People say this movie is too complicated. It's not complicated - it's just ridiculous.The time inversion thing doesn't make sense because which ever way you claim to understand it, there are plot holes after plot holes. It's just a gimmick to bewilder people, whilst showing reverse video clips edited with forward video clips, that are supposed to be entertaining. It wasn't entertaining.Poor casting for lead actor - he looks stoned and withdrawn in too many scenes - no way convincing as the supposed role of 'protagonist'.Pretentious and bombastic script writing.Audio mix is terrible. Can't even understand what actors are saying often.Score is atrocious.Overall a waste of time."
"Review of Tenet : This is the first movie I have legitimately HATED in quite some time. The 2 and a half hour bore fest has almost zero winning elements. It's got a very effective music score. Outside of that, the movie has a couple of MILDLY amusing combat scenes occurring in reverse, as advertised, and one impressive death scene. That aside, what does Tenet really consist of?To me, it feels like Christopher Nolan decided that this film's schtick would simply be featuring a lot of reverse action footage - and that would make it stand out enough to win people over. Well, it did work in the sense that seeing it in trailers did at least pique a lot of interest. But, somehow he thought that his asinine plot would somehow validate all the reverse footage enough to keep it intriguing, and sellable? Absolutely not.By the time you're 45 minutes into the movie you realize you're simply caught in someone's really bad idea that just doesn't work. So, how can the film cover all this up? Apparently by giving the movie as big of a cast as possible, and making sure that each cast member is from a different part of the world, in order to make the movie feel more worldly, and thus by default, more sophisticated. Then, we consistently place these characters in the largest, most obscure vehicles or machines that we can possibly get our hands on, in situations that physically present very high stakes, but otherwise leaves the viewer asking ""wait, why are they here though? Like, why are they doing this right now?"", and then blow up as much stuff as possible. EXPLOSIONS, MAN. But, none of it works - no matter how big the boat is, or how big the explosion is, no one's going to care or feel a thing if the plot and the film's characters are so insanely vapid. And that is precisely the case here.I recall a lot of people complaining about the audio in this movie, that they ""couldn't hear what they were saying"". I honestly believe that's because the dialogue is so useless, so void of all relativity & void of all humanity, that their brains were actually just blocking the information from being processed because it was such waste. Subconscious filters at work, if you will.I appreciate a good ambitious, original movie in this day and age, but holy lord, this is simply not cinema to me. It's a wank fest through and through. No story, no characters, no movie. It's gotta be my least favorite Christopher Nolan movie. Definitely my least favorite movie of 2020. I would say avoid at all costs."
"Review of Tenet : Spending almost ten years working on the story, and five writing the script, in Tenet, Christopher Nolan is yet again examining the vagaries of time, a theme that's front and centre in Memento (2000), Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk (2017). It's undeniably fascinating to see a tent pole Hollywood production engaging with issues such as entropy, thermodynamics, reversibility and irreversibility, the grandfather paradox, and T-symmetry, all the while keeping proceedings housed firmly within the spy genre (it's a Bond movie in all but name). However, the film's main problems aren't related to the squandered existential potential, the much-ballyhooed complexity, the puzzle-like structure, the philosophical musing, or the thematic similarity to Nolan's previous work. Rather, they are more fundamental, existing almost entirely at a structural level (although some of the performances don't help matters, nor does the abysmal sound mixing). The film looks incredible, the practical effects in the action scenes are extraordinarily mounted, the cinematography is stunning, and the editing is superb, but there simply isn't anything of note under the shiny veneer. It's a film with virtually no interest in human beings.The plot of Tenet is straightforward in outline. We follow a CIA operative known only as The Protagonist (John David Washington) as he is recruited into an ultra-secret international espionage squad called Tenet. His mission is simple - at some point in the future, someone has figured out how to reverse the entropy of objects, effectively being able to send them back along the timeline without having to reverse time itself. The implications of this are catastrophic and have set humanity on course for World War III, and probable extinction, unless The Protagonist can figure out who is doing it and put a stop to their machinations.Tenet is an event movie in every way; this 150-minute, $200m+ original idea is a massive studio tent pole written and directed by the most popular filmmaker alive. And I will say this, the budget is on the screen. Oftentimes, you'll see a movie that's cost a ridiculous amount and you'll sit there thinking, ""they must have spent a lot on catering."" With Tenet, however, it's all there, front and centre. No small amount of that money, of course, must have gone on the practical effects (incredibly, the film has only 280 VFX shots) - whether it be bungee-jumping onto the side of a building, a close-quarters fight where one of the combatants moves in reverse, a Boeing 747 jet crashing into a building (which was shot for real), a highway chase where some of the cars are going forward in time and others are going backwards, or an all-out battle scene where, again, some of the soldiers travel forward whilst others move in reverse.It's one of those films where you'll genuinely be asking yourself, ""how the hell did they do that?""; a question that's become increasingly rare in our CGI-reliant times. Along the same lines, the cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is stunning, as he mixes 15-perf 70mm IMAX film with traditional 70mm stock and a few 35mm sequences in a manner where the shifts in aspect ratio are barely noticeable. It's the kind of film that could only exist in the medium of cinema - no other art form could even begin to approximate its aesthetic design and splendour. A celluloid purist, Nolan has always made a big stink about the artistic importance of cinema, and Tenet finds him pushing the aesthetic boundaries of what the art form can accomplish.Unfortunately, no matter how visually unique or aesthetically impressive it may be, no amount of gloss can hide the fact that the screenplay is a turgid mess and suffers from some fundamental problems - most notably, it's bereft of emotion and populated with cardboard cut-outs that are supposed to be characters. The problems start early when The Protagonist is told that the future of humanity depends on his mission. This is precisely when I started to tune out. Any film that declares its story is none-other than saving humanity has gone so big as to render the people who populate its narrative as insignificant. It's also a cliché, it's dull as dishwater, and we've seen it done a million-and-one-times.As for the characters, good lord, they're badly written. The Protagonist isn't a person with an interiority; he's a cypher, the audience's surrogate so that Nolan can explain the plot to us. And there's nothing more to him - he's utterly emotionless, seemingly void of any kind of relatable motivation, has no psychological through-line, and nothing even resembling a character arc. As for Kenneth Branagh as Russian oligarch Andrei Sator, think of the most clichéd Russian villain you've ever seen. Now square that and you'll be some way towards imagining how ludicrous Sator is. He isn't a person - he's a collection of near-satirical tics, clichés, and elements from other, better films. Maybe with a more menacing actor in the role, it might have worked, but all I could think whenever he was on screen was ""that accent is hilarious."" Robert Pattinson's Neil (The Protagonist's handler) and Elizabeth Debicki's Kat (Sator's wife) fair better, but neither set the screen alight. Along the same lines, much of the second half of the film hinges on the fact that The Protagonist and Kat find themselves drawn to one another, yet Washington and Debicki have zero chemistry. At a human level, there's nothing to take a hold of the audience, nothing to make us care about any of these people.Speaking of Kat, a common criticism of Nolan's filmography as a whole is that his female characters tend to be victims whose deaths motivate men or who need saving by men, and/or women who define themselves almost entirely in terms of their relationship to men. Now, I'm not saying that Nolan is obliged to write more rounded female characters. He isn't. Much like one of his favourite filmmakers, Michael Mann, Nolan's films are androcentric. And there's nothing wrong with that. However, in Mann, there are to be found strong female characters with considerable agency, whereas in Tenet, Kat is nothing more than a pawn in a game played by powerful men who effortlessly control her. She defines herself almost entirely in terms of her role as a self-sacrificing mother, and whilst this is an interesting trait the first couple of times it comes up, by the time Nolan is reminding us of how much she has sacrificed for the 237th time, it had become obvious that this was going to be the extent of her characterisation.At one point early in the film, The Protagonist is told ""don't try to understand it, just feel it"", which is advice that Nolan is also offering to his audience. The problem is that there's nothing to feel. Tenet is a puzzle, the impenetrability of which will depend on each individual viewer (and how much of the appallingly poorly-mixed dialogue you can make out), but unlike Memento (which remains Nolan's best by a long way), which packed a seriously emotional gut-punch when we finally learn what was at the heart of the puzzle, Tenet offers us nothing more than the task of deciphering it for its own sake. There's no payoff. There's nothing to make us want to penetrate a story that seems more intent on reminding us how clever it is than trying to depict real people or establish real emotional stakes; it's a film more enamoured by the complexity of its own design than by any of the people contained within. It's an emotional void - all technical virtuosity and surface sheen with next to nothing at its core."
Review of Tenet : Painful... Everywhere from the horrific score to the almost impossible plot... And who did the sound engineering? Couldn't understand any dialogue. It has some good moments but overall my stomach became to upset for me to endure it.
Review of Tenet : I think Nolan would approve...approve would Nolan think I.
"Review of Tenet : Spoiler-freeThe editing is confusing in places. One minute we are in one area and the next, the same character is in another area. Now this isn't part of the inversion process but just a general cut from one place to another but it was done so jarringly it felt as though it was thrown together quickly to reach a deadline.The plot is all over the place with a lot of loopholes but I guess the whole thing can be explained by saying ""Paradox"" a few more times.The acting is nothing special. In fact in some places I really struggled to hear what was being said because of a sudden loud piece of music drowning out the actor's one line. Again, was it thrown together? A decent sound mixer / composer would have avoided this issue.The action is ""meh"". Yes there are some cool inverted scenes but not enough to warrant the long run-time and at the end with most people in full riot gear, I really struggled to tell who was who and, more to the point, to care about any of them.More annoying is the film follows this pattern:1. do something cool.
2. explain how
3. talk about doing something cool
4. explain how
5. explain again for the people at the back
6. do something cool
7. explain what happened just in case people still aren't following.
8. explain again.
9. talk about doing something cool...It's the same process from start to start and, quite frankly, it is boring and that is something I never thought I would say. Inception was mesmerising from start to finish but this is misfire after misfire.Christopher Nolan thinks he is a clever filmmaker but, in this instance, he has just tried too hard."
"Review of Tenet : Pretentious crap !There I said it !This film certainly got me to react but not in a good way, I was not the only one who couldn't follow the story either, the actors were obviously also mystified by it ! The reason the story was impossible to follow was because none of the actors could figure it out either ! They were trying their best but it was clear early on they were hoping it would all suddenly make sense, they were not convincing and the story was lost in translation !Add that to an overwhelming music track and really low level vocal track and you have a recipe for disaster. It seems like it was specifically designed to launch the career of the lead actor but if he wasn't convincing then it comes across as pretentious !Very annoying especially after all the hype !"
"Review of Tenet : I don't want to spoil anything and because im pretty mad that I paid to watch this trash here it is.
Nolan is my favourite director, but in my opinion this movie is trash. It is trying so hard to be ""smart"", that is losing its point. For me, the main ""thing"" of the movie was obvious from the first 20 minutes. Also, there are insane plot holes (ex. oxygen, won't say more to not spoil anything). The scenes as well as the dialogue were ""trying so hard"" that it was getting confusing all the time.
When you try to innovate, sometimes you fail.
His worst movie. Period."
"Review of Tenet : It could be less complicated than this, so someone can enjoy the movie, why would reverse the time ?!I hope Nolan will not repeat this idea and play with time again !!"
"Review of Tenet : This movie tried to became a ""masterpiece"" , but it failed terribly, in its own logic and plot holes. I felt like Christopher had gone too far trying to fool people with using some jargon ""physics"" paradoxes , which doesn't even make sense to people who understands ""physics"". It was that bad. The fast pase dramatic scenes, mumbled dialogues, and confusing characters with confusing timelines of the movie, made it almost unwatchable! Sorry Nolan, it was a ""Disastrous Masterpiece"""
"Review of Tenet : Inception - good story, good visuals, decent movie, then came Interstellar - beautiful story, stunning visuals, great movie. Now we have Tenet, a palindrome title which looks like an uneasy clickbait... Then you buy a ticket because ""a Nolan movie"", then you find yourself in the movie theater and feel stupid! You've seen before Inception, then you've seen Interstellar so you have EXPECTATIONS. No one told you that most probably this movie was made by a secret union between Marvel and Disney. Then you come home and read comments like ""you have to rewatch it""!!! Did you read that story when in the end a kid yell ""the king is naked""? That is the case, we are talking here about a B movie where they spent an A+++ budget. That's all, don't feel guilty you didn't understand all the mambo-jambo scientific like stuff they claim as legit, they have to feel guilty because they weren't able to put it together in a coherent plot-fabric."
"Review of Tenet : I grasped the premise. I understood the plot. But I just did not give a damn. The story was contrived and cliche from the beginning - Russian villains, secret tech (that's actually unnecessary to the story oddly) really boring characters and even more boring pacing. I actually felt like leaving halfway it was so pretentiously 'clever.' It would have made a decent time-heist film without all this 'inversion' BS which if we're honest, was a blunt contrivance to allow for cool looking backwards effects. This was a real REAL chore to get through. The two stars I did give it were for the effects and acting which were solid."
"Review of Tenet : Two stars because it was at least entertaining. A ""masterpiece"" though? How pretentious can you get? This is no masterpiece. The problem I had with it, was they had this really cool idea about time, and how people can move forward or backward through it for some nefarious purpose, then they muddied it up with a story they never explained, and kept going without ever connecting the dots. The grand moral at the end was ""a mother's love is stronger than anything, and she'll do whatever she has to to be with her son."" Like was that why this movie exists?!?!? This is a masterpiece?!? Grow up.I started getting pissed when the characters had to construct this elaborate plan to break into that high-security vault to steal the drawing. The heist was actually interesting and there was action present. Afterall that drawing (for no legitimate or logical reason) was forcing the girl to be a slave to her abusive husband. So protagonist and Neil construct this plan and go into the vault, dodging the suffocation gas that puts out fires, ultimately finding future protagonist and scuffle. And that's it.However long later, girl is on cloud nine cause protagonist stole the drawing. But he didn't really; he lied, for some reason?!? Girl finds out that he lied because abusive husband serves her the drawing on a silver breakfast platter. So here we are, an elaborate heist, a failed mission, a lie saying they succeeded, but no clear reason as to why any of that mattered or why protagonist would lie to her. And back to the drawing... how can a shiiiitteee piece of paper of two people hugging (or something) force girl to be a slave?!!!!?Again. This is no masterpiece. You're not interesting, enlightened, or an intellectual for using that word. You appear the opposite because ""having to use my brain"" does not make it a good movie. If anything, your brain swindled you by creating a fantasy or an explanation of this film that is incorrect. It was entirely incoherent, and while it had a cool premise, it failed completely. I might watch it again so I can at least remember character names when I go to talk badly about it. After 2.5 hours of watching four characters spin in circles around each other, the only memorable name was Neil. Goes to show how poorly these characters were written and developed. Totally unmemorable. Pass."
"Review of Tenet : Nolan is fast disappearing up hos own a**e. I'm a big fan, but Chris just please hit the reset button & start again. As other reviewers stated, massively over convoluted plot made nigh on impossible to grasp due to the terrible sound. Avoid. C'mon Chris, you know better."
"Review of Tenet : Well, it's a bad plot, written to look smart. But there is no real backbone. Maybe if You watch the movie in reverse it makes more sense.Visually it's interesting and car chase in Tallin is kewl.. but the story is bahad..
I watched it during two days, because after the first hour I was so confused, not getting any interest and bored..
And the second hour next day..same feeling.Characters are bad,boring.. story...so, go watch something else."
"Review of Tenet : This story is so old you know what is gonna happen the entire movie after 20 or 30 min.A lot of talking and nice suits, cgi action and flashes.So mediocre it hurts, so much money and effort to this.Hard pass unless I m bored in plane."
"Review of Tenet : When a filmmaker gets to write, direct and co-produce a pet project it can either be a masterpiece (Coppola's Apocalypse Now) or a total mess driven by vanity (Nolan's Tenet)Just what was he thinking? Surely the editor could have at least said No! you can't have a confused looking Washington nod at the word 'Paradox' then move swiftly on to the next incomprehensible plotless scene acting like he knows what's going on.This is Nolan's disaster. His Heaven's Gate. Hopefully it's not the end of his career as Memento and Inception were good."
"Review of Tenet : Not really sure what to say about this movie. I just didn't care about any of the characters.Can't stand the type of movie where everything just lines up for the protagonist, and this is definitely one of those movies.Save your money."
"Review of Tenet : We made the mistake of buying this without subtitles. I could only understand about 25% of the dialogue. The sound was poor, the lead actor was disappointing and did not speak at all clearly. There is no excuse for such poor sound in a movie that cost so much to make."
"Review of Tenet : As someone who really enjoyed other Nolan movies like The Dark Knight, and Interstellar, this movie is just categorically bad.It's basically a bland James Bond knock-off with a secret agent taking on a villain on a yacht, except there's a confusing time travel gimmick meaning the characters sometimes move backwards in time instead of forwards. The way the movie presents this is complete and utter nonsense, but fine let's suspend our disbelief.When I say confusing, the reason is not that it's a particularly hard concept to grasp (it's not), but because the film goes out of its way to make it difficult to understand. First of all, all the dialog is muffled so if you want to understand more than the occasional word you have to watch it with subtitles. Then when you watch it with subtitles, you realize why they muffled the dialog - it's because it mostly consists of incomprehensible gibberish.After a lot of meandering and the occasional set piece, this all this culminates in a badly choreographed big battle scene where the movie fails to actually show you who the good guys are fighting against, making the whole thing look like a live fire exercise instead of an actual battle.By this point though it's hard to care anyway. Even though the acting is as good as you'd expect, there's little character development and once you strip the time travel gimmick away, the plot boils down to a straight forward hunt for a McGuffin.Wished I'd followed my instincts and stopped watching before I got to the end."
Review of Tenet : Other reviewers weren't kidding when they said you can't understand the dialogue. How does this movie get released? When the plot is complicated you MUST be able to hear the lines. Nolan is a moron
"Review of Tenet : Worst movie I've seen in a while. No character building, no introduction to anything, just a lot of plot holes from an over complex theory which no one knows anything about - time travel. Loads of really pointless action scenes. Tried to bring back USA vs Russia stereotypes."
"Review of Tenet : Has Christopher Nolan lost it? This is the first Nolan film I actually dislike and im usually a big fan of his. Inception is one of my fav films of all time so I went into this thinking I would at least enjoy elements of it. I didn't. The concept is no where near as enticing as Inception and the execution was very poor.It had no redeeming features either as apart from Pattinson (who was quite good) the performances lacked conviction, the action was very dull and all the plot was told during lengthy dialogue sequences where the characters explain everything to each other. Music sounded like a parody of itself and the world in which all this takes place was dull and lacked a sense of place. Nothing felt real.It felt like Nolan really wanted to make a James Bond film and threw in the backwards bullets to give a sci-fi twist. Unfortunately he does not seem to know what makes Bond work and all we get is his lifeless characters and environments mixed with a science lecture. I'm not surprised he hasn't been given an actual Bond film of his own to make if this is what he pitched."
Review of Tenet : This movie is trying so hard being logically complex to the extend it make no sense whatsoever .Waste of time
"Review of Tenet : I've seen other reviews saying it's better the second or third time. Therefore I will give this film a second go, however, on the first watch it is difficult to follow and characters mumble important script. I've never left the cinema feeling that disappointed and baffled in my life."
"Review of Tenet : Mind bending? Okay yes in a way its hard to follow whats exactly going on sometimes, but its so senseless in a way it hurts.The worst thing to me is the whole purpose. No smart evil plan to conquer the past, or make use of time travel features to stop climate change. No, Just a simple sick evil russian who will die anyway and wants to take everyone with him. The rest around the plot is his boring wife with her kid, we never actually see or care about. New people Just appear, dropping huge heists with Zero preperation. I know they did it already in a Loop multiple Times Blabla, but as a watcher its not convincing in that moment, not immersive, even confusing and clearing that up in the last 10 Minutes of the movie, doesnt make up for 2 hours of boredom.science not plausibleweak charactersstupid russian villain - American Hero, made up Story""mind bending"" stuff aside - just not goodtoo long (fighting scenes are used all twice..... because of the beautiful loop)sound horribletoo much pengpeng and no good dialogueLast 10 Minutes of the movie Twist ""Here the real Message of the movie"" - Like, now its a masterpiece because tada, timetravellogic all ....come onIm gonna watch it again! Backwards, and hope i get my wasted time back."
"Review of Tenet : Nolen tries too hard to be clever, all it does is lead to a overly complicated movie, full of plot holes.Nothing really happens, you feel absolutely no emotional connection to any characters, i couldn't have cared less if any of them died or succeeded, wasn't invested in any of them. No character development what so ever.Sound mix was terrible, i couldn't hear half the dialogue, and the action scenes were stupidly loud, my mother was covering her ears and said it was actually painful.Critics are rating it purley because its the great Christopher Nolen, and they are scared they'd be seen as stupid if they said anything other that this is an amzing film. I am not a Nolen basher, i love literally every movie he has done, and was very excited to see this, most disappointed i have been since IT Chapter 2."
"Review of Tenet : The movie started with a very intense ""Batman"" like opening. This movie showed promise the first twenty minutes and even though nothing made sense, there was still hope that it would all be tied together and all make sense. Unfortunately, hope was lost quickly and the plot disappeared into a endless past-future alternate reality abyss and never came back. This movie lacked depth and seemed pretentious from Nolan. A truly intellectual ""flex"" that surely he had no idea what was going on either. If there was one good thing from Covid is- very few people have had to sit through this disaster of a movie."
"Review of Tenet : This movie may be glossy and pretty to look at but since it's utter nonsense it's difficult to care. The entire concept makes no sense. No characters to care about either, they are just there as set pieces."
"Review of Tenet : I wanted to love this, but it was impossible.I maybe understood 20 sentences in the hole movie.
The sound mixing was so utterly bad, that it could've worked as a 1920s silent movie, except that it was so loud you'd get a tinnitus.Actors where either muffled through gas masks or backward speak translated through walky talkies. On top everything was drowned in the phenomenal soundtrack.It was impossible to follow the complex plot.
I focused on the eye candy and hoped it would end without me taking hearing damage"
"Review of Tenet : This is the very first and last review I will ever leave for a movie.Never did I leave the movie theater so frustrated and confused in my life. I really wanted to like this movie and I usually try to never be too critical of a movie, but there was no part to which I could cling on and say there was something positive and great about it.Even if this movie is deeper and has complex themes which are interesting, your brain shouldn't be overloaded by attempting to comprehend every single second of the movie. It is way too heavy and everything moves way too fast for an effective analysis.The sound and music were waayy to loud to the point that my ears hurt. I literally didn't understand half of what the characters were saying which only worsened the confusion. Subtitles would have been necessary.There is very little backstory to any of the characters, and I didn't care for any of them due to a lack of great acting/ character development. What made Nolan's previous films so great is that it explores the complexity of the characters and their motivations. Here, you're just thrown in the action from the very first second with almost no explanation of each and everyone's purpose in the story.You should at least understand the majority of the concepts after you finish a movie. Here, you'll probably need to re-watch at least another time to start understanding the plot a little bit more. However, I'm not planning to waste another 2.5 hours of my life on this movie.Here's my reccomendation: don't waste your time and money on this film, you'll save hours of life."
"Review of Tenet : If you find movies with nameless characters pretentious, this will fit nicely into the pattern.Not only the protagonist is nameless, but he calls himself The Protagonist- how hilarious. ROFL. The Protagonist is the new James Bond, but not as funny. His story is a graceless mashup of Memento (reverse playing) + Inception (sharp-suited men moving in designer's environments) + Dunkirk (boys club of fighting and running around aimlessly).The Protagonist and his sidekick Neil also do a bit of time travel, to stop an evil - obviously Caucasian - enemy from destroying the world. Evil guy's name is Sator, and there's is also a firm called Rotas, somebody called Arepo and part of the plot takes place at the Opera.Once Nolan's done in trying to impress you with the Sator square, he adds the quantum arrow of time and reversing entropy, mixes it with the most banal female role you can imagine (a trophy, mistreated wife who loves her son very very much), a car chase, a couple of fist fights and an involuntarily hilarious and chaotic final scene involving a red and a blue team (Matrix anyone?).The ending involves a rip-off of Casablanca, with the two male heroes metaphorically kissing goodbye (or hello?) and more of The Protagonist being hyper cool.I understand Nolan likes 5 stars, slick hotels, luxury interior design, expensive suits and first class travel around the world. Also, he's not the sentimental type who can make you sympathise with his characters, but absolutely not giving a damn about any of them doesn't help enjoying this movie either, exactly because the plot is quite banal, but dressed up nicely with some smart - but condescending- gimmicks."
"Review of Tenet : At first sight, this movie was nonsensical and infuriatingly bad. However, since I watched the movie a few days ago, I have carefully reconsidered and re-examined the latest Nolan. I have come to the conclusion that it is easily one of the worst movies ever made, confirming my initial intuition. I tried to find some good but couldn't find any.The dialogue: horrible and cringe.
The sound mixing: ... Oh boy
The acting: yikes
Action: pretty ridiculous and unconvincing
Plot: nonsensical yet somehow still predictableDon't do time travel and try to explain it scientifically. Don't pretend you 'get' this movie, there's nothing to get here. I wish this movie was never made and I wish Nolan could be held accountable for making such trash."
"Review of Tenet : This is an action film packed with fast-paced fight scenes and rapid plot twists. But the film is disappointing in every respect. Most importantly, the plot is uninteresting and the characters are simplistic and shallow. The sci-fi twist of the story is ridiculous.The men are of simple man's-gotta-do-what-man's-gotta-do types. And women are portrayed as usual in Hollywood films: beautiful objects, caring mothers, or vengeful lovers. None of the characters appear as real human with cognitive depth. There's no discussion, no reflection, no personal growth. The plot relies on naive narratives: the hero must save the beautiful girl, the mother will do anything to save her child, the betrayed lover seeks for a revenge, the omnipotent antagonist wishes to destroy the world due to personal vanity. What's new, Nolan?The pseudo-scientific idea of reversing the time is yet-another crazy Hollywood plot twist that does not have any scientific basis. As a scientist the film makes me laugh. It seems that the action genre as a whole has been completely exhausted, so the only way to create something ""new"" (and to keep the viewer from falling asleep) is to make the cars run backwards.Some people think that the film is interesting (""masterpiece"") because the plot is complex and you cannot spot all the details on the first watch. Well, I did spot most of it on the first watch and ... it was not interesting. The story is predictable and does not provide any new ideas that haven't been dealt with in previous films. The underlying philosophy of the future of the world and righteousness is naive and simplistic."
"Review of Tenet : Christopher Nolan is one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. Unlike so many directors who began their careers outside of Hollywood and then moved to Hollywood for mainstream success, Nolan has maintained creative control over his work. Moreover, his interests in the concept of time and the medium of non-linear storytelling have persisted from the smaller movies he cut his teeth on at the start of his career to the big studio flicks he is known for now. It is one thing to make cutting edge movies on a small budget, it is another to transition into making big budget movies that are accessible to the mainstream and it is yet another thing to be able to continue to push your trademark themes and aesthetic sensibilities throughout your diverse body of work. For that Nolan deserves to be commended.Unfortunately, Tenet is a heartless and charmless affair. This may very well be an example of an auteur getting swallowed by their own ego and losing sight of what made their movies great in the first place. Christopher Nolan has made some great movies over the course of his career and a lot of his movies are founded upon unique story-telling components. But the thing about Memento, with its reverse-order narrative, or Inception, with its dream-within-a-dream plot points, is that these story-telling components were just that - devices to tell a story and expand on the characters. For all Inception's plot twists and major action set pieces, the movie was held together by the pathos surrounding Leonardo DiCaprio's character who was grieving for his dead wife and the movie had a resounding message about letting go of the past and living in reality.With Tenet, the story-telling components are gimmicky and, although they come together to tell a complex story, I lost interest around the 90-minute mark. What good is a sophisticated plot if you care nothing for the characters? This movie, like a lot of Nolan movies, is built on one big, speculative concept which requires you to go with it to a large extent. But there is little effort to really make you invested in the characters or the world before that concept is introduced.Early reviews are praising John David Washington's charisma, but I can't say I saw that myself. Washington isn't bad, he does the best with what he's given, but his character (who is known simply as 'The Protagonist') is under-developed. There is also praise coming for Robert Pattinson and I will admit that Pattinson's performance may be the highlight of the movie, but that isn't saying much. Like 'The Protagonist', Pattinson's 'Neil' is a mysterious character without any clear back-story or motivation. A movie could work if one of the two leads were like that - but not both. Perhaps if they made Washington's Protagonist more grounded and relatable, then Neil would work with his wry, Christopher Hitchens-esque, mystique. Alternatively, if they gave Neil a fleshed-out backstory and motivation then he could have served as a focal point for the audience to see the more sublime Protagonist. Instead, both characters are effectively superheroes with ultra-competence but poorly fleshed out development and motivations.Reviewers will undoubtedly note the action sequences and the special effects of this movie - which are impressive - though I feel that Nolan could have heeded the 'less is more' principle a bit more. By the end of the movie I was so worn out with the action and trying to keep up with it, that I was no longer impressed by the visuals. Instead of staging these complex action scenes, greater emotion could have gone into them to get us to feel the stakes. Then again, what are stakes when you care nothing for the characters?"
"Review of Tenet : I found this movie incredibly hard to get through. I found myself turning the volume up and down non stop. People are telling us we need to watch it more than once to get it. I literally do not have the time and nor should I have to watch something more than once to actually ""get it"".To be quite honest, I felt the entire movie had a B-Grade feel to it. I had to keep reminding myself this movie has some wonderfully experienced actors in it.For example, both Michael Caine and Robert Pattinson were absolutely flawless as someone else mentioned.For me, it was a case of, Washington simply doesn't possess the required acting chops to carry the Lead Role in this particular movie and whoever Cast him should see this as constructive criticism. Washington's complete lack of experience is glaringly obvious, and it was this, that adds to the whole overall B-Grade feel.This movie was so tedious to watch, not to mention the carpal tunnel I developed having to change the volume on the remote a gazillion times,It's very simple really, 1 star is too much for this film. And no, I have no time to go back and watch it a second time. The first was bad enough."
"Review of Tenet : Tell me, if everything is going backwards, should't they speak out the words and sentences the same way - backwards? But no, they speak normal laguage.
And if you think about logics and details, it's the same - it's only flaws in there.
Acting is okay, though, and visuals are great. But if you are looking for sense, it is not the case."
"Review of Tenet : ""Tenet"" is neither complicated nor clever. It's an implausible action/espionage story with ridiculous time travel nonsense thrown in. It's sort of a very bad combination of the ""Mission Impossible"" films, the ""Terminator"" films, and ""12 Monkeys."" The characters are trite, and, in some cases, the actors are poorly cast for roles; I can't imagine any audience member actually caring about any of these cardboard cutouts. The script is often laughable in its attempt to be mysterious, exciting, and deep, none of which it achieves. Much of the dialogue, in trying to be impressive, is actually comical. While it has a lot of action scenes, they are often drawn out and tedious. And the idea of reversing the film to demonstrate reversing time is a cliché as old as film itself. The music is truly abominable, imitating old simple-minded analog electronic shtick from the 1970s or, mixing electronics and instrumental samples, pounding out a few crass themes over and over until you almost want to scream. And when I say pounding, I mean it, as the volume of the music and sound design are insufferably loud, sometimes drowning out the dialog.. Maybe the ear-shattering levels at which old rockers used to play as they went deaf influenced Nolan's preferences for final soundtrack mixes. Perhaps worst of all, the film is terribly bloated: an hour could have been cut from this film without giving up anything central to the paltry plot, and it still would have been too long. At 150 minutes, the film seems interminable. All of these problems lie at Nolan's feet, and he, alone, is responsible for this mess. While a lot of people seem to like this film, I know that many are impressed by quantity over quality, and allow themselves to be mesmerized by fast-paced action and cutting, all of which are derivative and lack any cinematic interest. It's the kitchen sink approach.In my opinion, Nolan has done four good films: ""Following,"" ""Momento,"" ""The Prestige,"" and ""Inception."" It seems that the more money he gets to make a film, the worse it is. I don't think I'll bother to see any of his work in the future. I do think whatever talent he had earlier in his career has dissipated in direct inverse proportion to the budgets of the films he writes and directs. Perhaps he could access reversed entropy to improve his future work."
"Review of Tenet : I would've been able to understand everything in this complicated story - if I could've HEARD half of the dialogue. I watched parts of this film in three different environments, and even in the best one way too many important lines were simply unintelligble. Since this is apparently a conscious choice by the director, I doubt I'll ever watch another Nolan film."
"Review of Tenet : I've enjoyed many Nolan films (seen the Batman's several times and loved Inception) but he really disappeared up his own backside with this one.I've heard interviews where Nolan claims to have spent a lengthy amount of time over several years devising the plot for this. If that's the case then how does he expect an audience to unravel the plot in two hours and enjoy this?There did not seem to be any character development. I felt little or no empathy or interest in any of the characters. It felt emotionless and cold, confusing and I couldn't wait for it to end.People have said it improves with repeated viewings but it made me so aggrieved at the first viewing that I'm not going to waste my time with this again.This seems to be a similar situation as with Tarantino - whereby nobody can seemingly say 'No' to him, which has resulted in this nonsense.I get the sense that Nolan thinks he is challenging his audience into sparking some mature, intellectual or philosophical debate. However, he's completely missing the point by continually trying to deceive the audience.Absolute Guff! I hope they don't let him anywhere near Bond."
"Review of Tenet : How can I go backwards in time to where I started watching this movie and convince myself to watch an episode of ""Golden Girls"" instead?A lot of people say this movie makes sense if you watch it again. Why would anyone watch this movie twice?How does anyone tell these big-budget action apart? They all work under the premise that violence and gun-play are synonymous with quality, as in the more of them the better. They all have some huge and diabolical plot where the protagonist is ""fighting for the survival of the entire world.""We have to talk about the sound mixing in this mess. If I didn't have subtitles, I would have never understood about twenty-five percent of the dialogue. At what point does dramatic music (is it music?) become very undramatic and annoying? If you've ever wondered about that, all your answers can be found here.There is no real plot to this, it's just action scenes cobbled together, none of which really have much to do with the other.Why does he care so much about the wife of a Russian oligarch? ""Leave her alone,"" he cries at one point. It makes no sense at all the risks he takes to pull her irons out of the fire.$200 million budget. Imagine how many good movies they could have made for this sum."
"Review of Tenet : Movies are about creating an experience for a viewer, to create feelings, whether positive or negative. In order to do that, you need to have some understanding of whats happening, and you need to care about the characters. In this movie, I had no idea what the story was about, and what the characters wanted.I love, I loved inception despite its flaws. This movie has all of inceptions flaws made into the main course. It's almost as if the movie outright hates its audience. Even in inception, with its lack of human characters, you still kinda cared for Cobb. When he reunites with his kids, you feel lit, and you understand his motivation. In this movie, you have none of this.I've seen bad movies, but this movie fails on the basic foundations of what a movie needs to be, to be entertaining and valuable. I almost fell asleep a few times"
"Review of Tenet : If you think Inception was confusing, be sure and watch (and try to endure) this 2 1/2 hour Nolan disaster.After Inception, Nolan must have thought: ""Let's make an action film where all the characters, the explosions, the car chases, EVERYTHING, goes backward.. We don't need CG, all we need to do is run our scenes backward"".This was a very cheap and very ineffective technique to film an action movie. Shame on you Christopher Nolan. Inception this is NOT.If that weren't bad enough, the plot is about as clear as a Mississippi swamp.Those fans that are saying ""watch it 2-3 times then you'll get it"" need professional help. No movie - repeat no movie - should require multiple views to enjoy its content.Maybe Nolan thinks multiple views will generate even more income for this sad movie. Not a chance, Chris. Count me out. The thought of even a second viewing is unbearable. Go back to your drawing board."
"Review of Tenet : This movie was worse than a disappointment--it was a frustrating mess of a puzzle that I came to hate watching as it grew more and more complex. The point of the story is finding out what the story is about. About 30 minutes in I no longer cared because it was so incredibly confusing that I had no choice but to give up on it.I could barely hear what the characters were even saying as they casually and all-too briefly brushed over super essential exposition in low monotone voices in between a mindless grind of nonstop moving parts. That went on for the entire movie. Blink and you'll lose track of the plot because it makes no sense in the first place.If you want to just watch something unfold for the heck of it and would rather not spend even a second reflecting on any of it while it happens, this is your movie. In fact, if you prefer zero character development, zero emotion from anyone in screen, and basically zero point to the story other than to crunch through some occasional bizarre action scenes, this will be a gem to you."
"Review of Tenet : Apparently, some people have been able to figure out this time reversal thing. I tried. I really tried. On second viewing the film was starting to make sense. But then it completely went into the weeds when the nameless main character went into the reverse time scenario, I just had to give up. I am only about halfway through this disaster and my brain hurts too much to continue. It is just not worth the effort to try to make sense of this aweful film. On top of that, I had to ride my volume control throughout because the sound design is so uneven. I am sorry I wasted all my time on this. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. The other Christopher Nolan films I have seen have been quite enjoyable but Tenet is a total dud."
Review of Tenet : Was there ever an actual good idea for this movie? If there was it was 100% lost in translation. One of the most frustrating and ridiculous movies I have ever seen. And the music over the vocal audio all the freaking time is plain stupid. Not only is this movie not worth paying for it's not worth your time to watch it for free.
"Review of Tenet : Had high expectations but the movie is long and boring. It had such an confusing plot that tricks you into thinking the movie is ""actually good"". It's quite slow paced, nor suspenseful and hated the sound mixing, too loud, unable to hear the dialogues due to that is just unforgivable.People are giving 10/10 ratings and praises, ignoring the plotholes and obvious flaws cause directed by Nolan. Think they're doing him a favour but we have to call out such things, else we keep gonna get mediocre movies. I'm sure because of blind fanaticism, same people not gonna find my review helpful, either. Original rating is 4/10, giving it 1 for balancing the high rating."
"Review of Tenet : Why should a English language film need subtitles, this one needs it, why do you have watch it twice, because it's laughable confusing, this is a joke, incomprehensible, the only thing it proves is that you can rewind film, we know that, I have an IQ 139, I love good movies, but this was a headache, between the incoherent narrative and the unbelievable plot, it's a turkey, don't buy into the rhetoric that it's somehow special , it's not, it's annoying that's all."
"Review of Tenet : Ignore the fake 9/10 and 10/10 reviews most likely coming from the actors. Tenet is a complete and utterly nonsense.1) ridiculous plot;
2) impossible to follow, but not because of some complexity of the plot (it is quite simple) but because the plot is empty;
3) no character development;
4) boring dialogues;
5) actors obviously confused about what exactly they are playing, which makes it all even worse.Not worth watching even once. Better to rewatch some movie you actually like."
"Review of Tenet : Just pure crap and I did love inception. But that one had a great and understandable story while Tenet is just pure nonsense that leaves everyone confused, probably even the actors themselves. Oh, and most of the action is basically just recorded action played backwards. And the cherry on the cake is the horrible film music that makes understanding of anyways hardly understandable Dialoges even harder. They wanted to make sometime Inception 2.0 but just overdid it massively."
Review of Tenet : Nolan always does his best. It fully met my expectations.
"Review of Tenet : The great Christopher Nolan latest film tells about Grandfather Paradox, full of unnoticeable clues throughout every screen, confusing events and mindblowing plot.Non-linear plot has been a basic formula for Nolan himself when it comes to filmmaking. The great scoring with shepard tone is also always his favorite part when working with great composer.This masterpiece's scoring was composed by Ludwig Göransson instead of Hans Zimmer but everything feels all right.
This motion picture is as confusing as how it is supposed to be though it has great script and non anticlimactic story.The build up does not feel to tell the audience about what's going on also the direction is intense in every single scene even with lack of details throughout the film that bothers the audience. It should be watched more than once to make up audience's mind and in order to understanding the plot. ""Preventing World War 3"" part does not really catch audience's attention in my opinion because we only wonder the motive behind every character does.It is Sci-Fi titled but reversion and time travel are captured realistically better than any movies that have done the common formula. Compared to Inception (2010), this one has bigger damage to your brain after seeing this."
"Review of Tenet : This action movie lasts half of the time, the other half is just the reversed first half which is intertwined with the first one.
Director or montage did the great job because I've watched whole movie. But at the same time they did terrible job because I've fallen asleep few times."
"Review of Tenet : Apparently lots of people think this movie is confusing. It is densely packed with information, but it all made sense the first time I saw it. Since I was never confused I was able to relate to the characters just fine and found the story rich and complex. My only problem with this movie is what I perceived as bad sound quality. Dialogue volume changes plague this movie and if you can't understand the characters, this movie is harder to follow. At times the music drowned out characters dialogue. I suppose the movie is meant to be watched at ear bleeding volumes so every bit of dialogue can be heard. I think if they had managed sound better, people would have understood better and that's a shame because this movie is a unique gem, however, with some inclusions. I watched the movie twice with only a four hour break in between to see if I was actually confused but didn't know it until a second viewing because of all the apparent confusion everyone complains about. It turns out I missed only very slight bits as a matter of bad recall, but not a lack of understanding.In my opinion this movie is among the top two best time travel movies ever made, the other being Edge of Tomorrow. If you have an understanding of physics, time and entropy, it's not that difficult to understand this movie ...unless you can't hear the dialogue. I think buying the movie for home consumption will
give the viewer better control over volume and make for a better experience."
"Review of Tenet : I went to see Tenet three days ago with high expectations based on the films trailer and Nolan's reputation. However, it was not long into the film that I started to lose interest and on two occasions felt I would soon be asleep unless I opened my eyes. That's how good it is, and my advice is don't waste time and money going to see this utter rubbish. The story is pure fantasy, the plot ridiculous, the dialogue is unintelligible - I just could not understand what the actors were saying most of the time - and the music score was a absolutely dreadful. The story was so hard to follow, I still do not know what it was all about to this day. Some way into the film three people walked out, later another two went and shortly after them I decided enough was enough, and so I left about 40 minutes from the end. Maybe the films storyline has been made so complicated so as to encourage multiple viewings to increase the films revenue, but I have no such intention. Some will say it is a masterpiece of cinematography and unmissable, but in just one showing six people, including myself, walked out during the film; and as it was a small audience due to COVID 19 Social Distancing, that says it all I think."
"Review of Tenet : The movie opens brilliantly (highly intense), right into the story. The movie does have a dense plot, which requires a lot of concentration to grasp but boasts visually stunning action that doesn't fail to blow your mind.
The concept of inversion is unique and fascinating and sets this apart from most other time related movies out there, simply due to its ability to deal with time effectively and believably. However, fully understanding the ideas of temporal pincers and inversion takes a bit of time and sometimes the film can be a little inaccessible. This is especially so, during the climax where certain details are hard to make out but the general idea would be clear if you're paying attention. Unlike what many say, there is an emotional punch to this movie as well. Side characters do a very good job. However, the protagonist lacks a bit of depth. The villian works for what the plot is about. And the score for this movie is absolutely brilliant, Mr Goransson nailed it.
Dialogue at times can be hard to hear at times but for the most part it's fine. Repeated viewings are encouraged to watch the movie from the perspective of different characters. The story becomes much clearer and the emotional impact is far greater."
"Review of Tenet : Tenet is a movie with interesting concepts and very impressive visuals, However, that's all it has going for it. The plot is very muddled and confusing. The sound was horrendous. While Christopher Nolan has interesting and creative ideas, the execution makes it worse."
"Review of Tenet : Nothing in Hollywood history Matches,Nolan this Time for something unpreceded to make a classic for the Upcoming future.For Most people, IT IS recommended to watch it twice before you rate it."
"Review of Tenet : And it got fugged slowly.
I'm still in doubt what to find of this movie.
Do I like it? Do I hate it? Still not sure.I'll give it a second watch since this is really needed to understand all the quirks in the storyline.
What were the writers thinking? No one will ever know I'm afraid."
"Review of Tenet : After a month of waiting the new Christopher Nolan extravaganza has been released in cinemas and I have to admit Nolan did not disappoint.Plot:
Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.Cast:
Elizabeth Debicki (Kat), Robert Pattinson (Neil), John David Washington (the Protagonist), Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Sammy) and Kenneth Brenner (Andrei Sator)Good things:
The good things in the film were the main characters who really well developed as well as the fantastic action sequences and finally the mixture all of the different genres combined.The main villain is the film is also extremely threatening and menacing to follow throughout the film.Mediocre things
The most mediocre thing in the film was the lack of continuity in the film as it shows at the beginning of the film that the suicide pill didn't work and yet at the end of the film everyone is trying to stop the main villain from using the pill. This makes no sense at all in my opinion.Bad things
The bad thing in the film was the lack of motivation for the Main Villains actions and master plan.Best Point:
The best point of the film was the opening sequence as it was extremely action packed and showed the full threat level of our main villain that we'd follow throughout the film.Worst Point;
The worst point is when we learn our Main Villains master plan as it shows a complete lack of continuity in the film as it shows at the beginning of the film that the suicide pill didn't work and yet at the end of the film everyone is trying to stop the main villain from using the pill. This makes no sense at all in my opinion.Score: 9.4 / 10"
"Review of Tenet : After seeing Tenet the first time, I had to work out in my mind the basic logic of the premise. After a discussion with my wife who also saw the movie with me, I found I worked out a lot of the detail and had even had some revelations. I avoided ""Tenet explained"" articles and YouTube videos. One week later, we went to see it a second time. On second viewing, the movie made much more sense and tied many loose ends in the logic. It enabled me to step back and marvel at the scale of the movie including the practical stunts, fabulous acting and beautiful settings.
We struggled with the audio of the movie. I understand that this was deliberate. Christopher Nolan has said one needs to feel the movie. When I see it for the third time. I plan to just take it in and not try to ""understand it, just feel it."" This is one of those films that will have a relatively low IMDb score initially. In years time I can see this climbing the IMDb ranks like The Prestige, for example, which by the way, like Tenet, the characters tell the audience what to expect through exposition. The Prestige clearly states it's a slight of hand. Tenet clearly states try not to understand it, just feel it. I am withholding my rating until I've had more time with the movie, which is a process that might take a few years."
"Review of Tenet : A CIA agent must manipulate the flow of time to prevent an attack from the future that threatens to annihilate the present world.Director writer Christopher Nolan delivers a visually crisp film, with some spectacular setups. It's entertaining and cerebral, but convoluted in places. It's not a time travel film per-say, more time inversion and temporal paradoxes. The film's cinematography, score, editing, acting and costumes are high quality. It's straight laced, haunting and mesmerising, with echoes of the best of James Bond vibe throughout.The supporting cast are first rate, leads Washington and Pattinson are outstanding in this backwards-moving, non-linear thinking offering. Branagh's original bad guy is an interesting dysfunctional addition.Overall, it's grounded sci-fi; quite a simple story, even if a little confusing on the surface. Worth watch for the performances alone."
"Review of Tenet : 6.9Tenet is a very well executed film. It has a great concept and it's execution is by no means incredible, squeezing every ounce of juice from said concept to leave a lasting impression on your mind. That being said, it's not good. There are many problems with this film, such as it's runtime and pacing. This movie is a little hard to rate, but it's very clear that this movie is not his greatest.Unlike some of his other movies, Tenet is completely devoid of emotion. The characters are not very interesting to the point where a soap opera would have characters with more depth. This is very, very disappointing if you include the fact that most of Nolan's movies were full to the brim will all kinds of emotions and characters that you can remember.Another problem with this movie is that Nolan may have gotten to carried away with the concept. It's a very interesting one at that, but it's also a bit complicated to the point where multiple videos had to be created for the audience to understand. As I pointed out in my review for Doctor Strange 2, you shouldn't complicate things to the point where the viewer must do their homework to fully enjoy a movie, even though that is what the MCU has become.In conclusion, Tenet is a great film with a great concept, but it seems that it's greatest weakness was the person who created the movie in the first place."
"Review of Tenet : OH Man !! , you will see that the beginning of this film is driven by the end of this film. One of the time travel fiction film - which is based on a new kind of technology. I gets interesting more and more - as the time passes through the film."
"Review of Tenet : Can not rate the film or giv any comments as I don't understand the film at all :). But one thing for sure, Neil is so hot. I've got to research more on him, the coolest character, knew what he was doing and what shoud be done next. Very niceeee. Get addicted to him!"
"Review of Tenet : Tenet sets it's own logic to build the film upon, it's fairly simple on the face of it which allows for an easy entertaining viewing. But it feels like at times there were predictable and disruptive decisions that snap the viewing apart from the momentum and tension it's slowly built. Some viewers may be displeased at some of the rather unrealistic dialogue choices some characters make. The effort to make all the fight choreography and action as authentic as it can be really pays off in some new iconic film scenes which I haven't seen done before. Overall well worth watching if you can be somewhat open minded."
"Review of Tenet : I don't even know why I'm writing a review for this. Maybe it's so my future self can judge my past self for a missed opportunity to appreciate something spectacular that I missed the first time around. (breathe)Guys all I can say is I attempted to watch Tenet. Got the premise within 16 mins and 33 seconds. It seems to be Source Code, Inception and Bond-esque films tied into one. I can't tell you what happened after that cause I never watched past another few minutes. I knew that's how I fell about the movie why it took me so long to view it in the first place, but did so at the urging of my brother who is into films and who I told basically the same thing I am tellin' ya here.Washington is getting a lot of buzz, but I don't get it. Good for him, though."
"Review of Tenet : This movie really was amazing, the plot was great, actors were great. i wish all action movies were more like this!"
"Review of Tenet : Michael Caine ; YOU need a new suit.J. D. Washington ; WE need some new dialogue.Michael Caine ; Damn straight !J. D. Washington ; . . . And a PLOT, that makes sense !Michael Caine ; CHECK THAT !J. D. Washington ; . . . And some SEXY BABES !Michael Caine ; . . . And some BETTER CO-STARS.J. D. Washington ; WHOA !!! I need this gig !"
Review of Tenet : This isn't a movie review. Rather it's a revelation about the moment I wasn't watching and just listened to the dialogue. I could've sworn that I heard Denzel Washington's voice and so I looked at who was playing the principal role and realized it was Denzel's son. I didn't know he had a son who was an actor. I'm impressed by his acting skills and was heartened by how identical his voice is to his his father. A new Hollywood dynasty.
Review of Tenet : He always pushes his movies to the limit adding the ability to rewatch his movies gathering easter eggs and enjoy his movies to the limit. JUST WAAAATCH IT
"Review of Tenet : With so many saying how hard it is to hear the dialogue, and after months of theater closures, we don't want to return to the theater only to be frustrated. Decided to wait until the DVD comes out with subtitles."
"Review of Tenet : Rob is so hot when he says god damn it and screw it. The female character is beautiful and lovingly fragile. However, I just don't see the connection in she and the man. Their motivation are so weak and not very convincing. As for the time reverse part, I kind of lost when the Russian husband tried to kill her. P.S. the sound effect makes me almost have a heart attack."
