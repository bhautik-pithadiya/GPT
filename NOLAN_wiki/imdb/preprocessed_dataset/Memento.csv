"Review of Memento : I know that it's a little late by now for this review considering this movie is twenty years old by now. However, it's still amazing. The way that Christopher Nolan puts this movie in a jumbled order that you don't quite realize until halfway through is genius. What's very interesting is how you have to think for a while then you get it. Spoilers ahead stop reading if you haven't seen it yet!
You have the movie starting with him shooting Teddy, and then how he got there in the next scene, but what's funny is you think it's leading up to (or I guess leading down to) how he's going to reveal that Teddy is the bad guy. He is not! He's a cop, a not crooked one but a cop all the same, that's using a guy with no short-term memory to kill off drug dealers. Then you have Natalie, who seems nice but is ripping him off just the same and is using him to kill drug dealers that are competition and to get the cop off of the streets. You have him being used by everyone around to fit their purpose, turning him from a man on a revenged quest to basically a serial killer. They make him kill who they want as long as they justify it will help him. It's very well told and really makes you mad that the guy you're rotting for is a killer that's been duped. Nobody is a good guy. There is no hero. And why is it good then? It plays with your mind so well, you walk away and contemplate on it forever. Great movie, one of Nolan's best ever."
"Review of Memento : If you're looking for something intense, suspenseful, and different than your usual effects-packed thriller, this is the best movie you will see all year. You will be talking about Memento at work, at the grocery store (to total strangers!), and you will find yourself joining conversations when you hear the word ""Memento."" That's why this little film that received almost no marketing stayed in theaters for months and was in the top 10 money makers for several weeks.The movie starts with a murder -- a revenge killing, in fact. But was the right person killed?Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man with no short-term memory. He hasn't been able to form new memories since the night his wife was murdered. Now he's on a hunt to find the murderer but with no way of remembering names, dates, places, facts and faces. Instead he tattoos himself with mementos of his search. When someone knows his name, he checks Polaroids to see if he knows them. Does he like this person? Does he trust this person? Is this the killer? He doesn't know unless he's scribbled a note.Don't worry about trying to empathize with Leonard because Writer/Director Christopher Nolan puts you right in Leonard's shoes. You live the story in reverse order so that you never know more than Leonard does. In one scene you see Leonard getting information from a person who knows him -- maybe a good person; maybe bad. In the next scene you see a previous meeting between the two which sheds more light on their relationship. Later still you see how they met. But is that all of the story? You've yet to find out... and you won't know everything until the last scene. By living it backwards, you, like Leonard, have no knowledge of what came before.It's brilliant story telling. But you might get frustrated because you don't know what's going on. That's normal. In fact, that's the whole idea. Just sit back, try to relax (though that's difficult in this movie), and find out just how twisted and complex Leonard's world is.This film will leave its own memento on your mind, and you'll have a hard time forgetting how much you enjoyed it."
"Review of Memento : FACT ONE: ""Just because there are things I don't remember doesn't make my actions meaningless.""FACT TWO: ""Your notes could be unreliable.""FACT THREE: ""Memories can be distorted.""FACT FOUR: ""But, even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it.  You won't even know it's happened.""FACT FIVE: ""I want time to pass, but it won't. How can I heal if I can't feel time?""FACT SIX: ""We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are.""When life becomes incomprehensible human beings tend to simplify things, revise memories, select facts that may or may not be representative of ""the truth.""  We strive to make events as intelligible as possible but that act often has unintended consequences.  Now, if you can capture this existential human reality on film in such a way as to allow the viewer to experience this struggle for understanding, for the placement of private aspirations into the context of the moment even as the primary character makes this same struggle, then you have connected our hearts and minds seamlessly with the film's lifeworld.  That is a rarity indeed.Such is Memento, a brilliantly conceived and executed work of art that has its audience literally at their wits end (just like the film's main character) trying to understand it all.  The great debate of whether Teddy's version of the truth at the end is really ""the truth"" is symptomatic of director Christopher Nolan's purposeful craftsmanship.  The very fact that we are as uncertain throughout most of the film as to the context of Leonard Shelby's actions as Leonard himself signifies that Nolan has succeeded in not just telling us Leonard's story put allowing us to know what it is like to *be* Leonard.  This allows the film to work at a much deeper, almost subconscious, level scarcely achieved on film.Guy Pierce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano all deliver terrific performances with some of the most original material I've seen in years. This film grabs your brain and won't let go.  It twists and turns and  just when you think you've got things figured out  Nolan whips the rug out from under your feet.  You are left totally involved and struggling with creating some sense of closure out of the infinite loop of the film's structure.You can debate endlessly whether Teddy's final summary of events is the truth.  You can argue both sides of whether Leonard killed his wife or invented Sammy Jankis out of thin air.  In the end these are open questions. In the end there are no definitive answers.  In fact, in the end ANY answer is plausible, just choose the one that sits best in your mind.  Make that the truth.  Because THAT is what this film is all about.  It's about a man who can remember who he is but not what he has done and, to that extend, it is the prefect postmodern critique.  We are often forced to act without sufficient information.  The accelerating rush of our lives sends us headlong into our present without full consideration of where we've been. And on that level Memento provides a bold, compelling narrative that connects Leonard with every person.  It is the mirror image of our divided selves.No matter how much his audience might disagree with the film's conclusion, Nolan understands that - in the end - truth doesn't matter.  It is what we choose to do with what we think is the truth that's important.  And that can mean anything at all."
"Review of Memento : Losing your memory would have to go close to one of the worst experience anyone could ever suffer from. In the movie Memento', we get to see how bad it is to suffer from short term memory loss. It also gives us the chance to see how far a patient of such a disease will go to remember what is most important to him. In the vain of Pulp Fiction', Memento is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. It is no wonder that this movie is so popular with the movie going public around the world. Leonard Shelby wears expensive, tailored suits, drives a late model Jaguar sedan, but lives in cheap, anonymous motels, paying his way with thick wads of cash. Although he looks like a successful businessman, his only work is the pursuit of vengeance: tracking and punishing the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty of locating his wife's killer is compounded by the fact that Leonard suffers from a rare, untreatable form of amnesia'. Although he can recall details of life before his accident' Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he is, where he is going, or why.Christopher Nolan has made one great (but confusing) movie. His style in directing and editing Memento' is quite unique, as no movie has ever been made quite like it before. The story being told in a backward kind of motion makes the audience have to think hard about what they are watching. It also makes the audience feel for a guy like Leonard, whose condition only gets worse and worse as the movie goes on. I am almost 100% sure that Nolan and his brother Jonathan, made up this story in the realisation that it was meant to be confusing. What is also cleverly done by Nolan is the use of black and white and then colour shots. In my opinion, the variations in these shots are used so it confuses the audience even more. 
Guy Pearce's role in Memento' shows me why he is so successful in Hollywood today. Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man on the hunt for his wife's killer. The only problem is that Shelby is suffering from anterior-grade amnesia', a disease that cannot be treated. With Lenny', I feel the audience suffers partly the same condition as he does, and partly does not, as we can remember what has happened in the present. Memento's other main stars include corrupt cop Teddy' (Joe Pantoliano). A friend said of Pantoliano's performance in Memento, he was perfect for the role of Teddy', as he comes across as the mysterious bad guy'. I could not agree more. There is also the character of Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who is a lot like Teddy in her own way. What is similar about these characters is the way they use Leonard's condition to advantage their own situations.
Other characters include Sammy Jenkis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who is a victim we learn about from an old case when Leonard Shelby was an insurance investigator. There is Leonard's wife, Catherine (C.S.I.'s Jorja Fox) who is another fascinating character. Although we do not hear her say much, she is a vital part of this most confusing story. Add in the funny role of Burt (Mark Boone Jnr.), the motel clerk, who openly admits to Lenny that he is ripping him off, by giving him two rooms, but that he will not remember it happening anyway.Yet in no way do any of the characters in Memento' realise they are in a time reversed movie. I am sure that many of the performers would have had to read their scripts many times to understand what was happening from a cinematic point of view. But from an acting prospective, this would have been an easy experience to be part of. Memento also has some interesting devices to tell the story. The way Leonard tries to remember things in the present and the future, via notes tattoos and photographs, making them an important element within the movie. Without them, our hero would not be able to remember anything. Nonetheless, memory is the most vital element in this movie, because without it, people are confused, isolated and abused, which is what happens to our hero', Leonard.  As Lenny mentions early on in the film, ""Memory's unreliable ... Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police; eyewitness testimony is unreliable ... Memory can change the shape of a room or the colour of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.""  But it has to be ironic that Leonard is the one who narrates Memento', when his recollections and memories of events are inaccurate and jaded. There are also some powerful scenes in Memento'. The one which sticks in my mind the most' has to be where Natalie abuses Leonard, calling his dead wife a whore', snorting smartly that you won't be even able to remember what I have said'.  So, if you watch this movie and it confuses you the first or even the second time, I can assure you that is how you are meant to feel, confused. If you hated watching Memento' the way Christopher Nolan intended, then I can only recommend that you get a hold of the DVD and watch it in chronological order, as it will really help you. Memento also shows how bad mental disease' patients can be abused by healthy people and what lengths sick patients will go to try and keep sane'. Also, if a movie makes you think, then in some way it has been successful in doing something that many movies do not do  making you think. Those sorts of cinematic experiences are the ones that we need to cherish for life, as they are few and far between. Memento is one such experience. CMRS gives Memento': 5 (Brilliant Movie)"
"Review of Memento : During the movie ""Memento,"" the audience is left guessing throughout the whole movie until the very end. It has a unique style of presenting the plot in which the movie begins with a scene and then it plays backwards from there. While the movie jumps backwards scene by scene, there is also a transition played in black and white that is continuously playing forwards until a certain point. It is not until the very end of the movie where the scenes played in color meet with the ones played in black and white. This is where the climax of the movie occurs and all the revelations of each characters role are revealed. It is a must see and you will not regret it.In the end of the movie we find out that the main character Lenny, who suffers from short term memory loss, has been tricked by his so called friend Teddy, into killing a drug dealer. Throughout the whole movie Lenny is on a quest to kill the murderer of his wife, who is in fact Lenny himself. Lenny gets the identity of himself and a man named Sammy Jenkis confused and we find out that Lenny is in fact Sammy. It leads us to believe that Lenny has used his brain condition to illicit forgetting what really happened to his wife to clear himself of shame and anger. This caused him to create Sammy Jenkis and allows him to believe that the ones who assaulted his wife and gave him the brain condition were the ones who supposedly killed his wife. We find out that Teddy, who is a local cop, has already helped Lenny kill the man who assaulted his wife. Yet Lenny forgot all about it and Teddy kept the proof and then used Lenny for his own benefit to kill a drug dealer for money. Once Lenny figures this out in the end of the movie he decides to burn all the evidence and leaves himself a clue that indicates Teddy is in fact the one who killed his wife. Lenny then leaves the scene reminding himself that he is still alive and then as fast as it was all revealed it is then forgotten. This leads us back into the rest of the movie in which we had already seen in reverse order.When the movie is over the audience is left shocked and slightly confused about how to view Lenny. He acts as if he is an innocent man who has now become a conscious free murderer. He forgets everything he doesn't write down but he is the one choosing to leave out the facts that he finds out on multiple occasions that he is in fact a murderer for pleasure. It started as pay back but for someone who forgets the feeling so easily and has no direction to his life, why not make it a hobby. It's odd to think about that he is spending all his effort searching for his wife's killer when in reality it is Lenny he is looking for. He takes the lives of others to free him of guilt which in the end makes him more of a villain than the movies hero."
"Review of Memento : So the ""innovative"" concept of filming out of sequence has been cliche for at least a few years now, but here's a film that makes it work far better than its been shown in a while.Having read the reviews and talked to others who saw it, I thought that I'd go into the movie figuring everything out right away and declaring the concept unworkable.  I couldn't be further from the truth.  This movie does things to your head that are illegal in some countries.  Portrayed (for all intents and purposes) backwards, it forces you to think in the same way that our lead character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce being more brilliant than usual) does.  Suffering from a condition that renders him unable to remember anything for more than a few minutes, he is searching for the man who raped and killed his wife.  Since each seen lasts no more than 15 minutes before jumping back to the what happened before that, our perceptions are shattered in the same way.Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) put in great performances that leave you guessing; simultaneously endearing and revolting.Overall I left the film trying to figure out what was what, and I'm still not sure.  This film noir concept shouldn't work, but it does so wonderfully."
"Review of Memento : I saw ""Memento"" in the early afternoon, a fact for which I am thankful. Why?  Because it then proceeded to dominate the majority of my thoughts for the rest of the day.  That night I lay in bed, tossing and turning, my mind trying to wrap itself around the story, and I absolutely could not GO TO SLEEP!  I finally just gave up on sleep, got up around midnight, and watched ""Election"" to cleanse my palate.  Then I went back to bed and starting contemplating ""Memento"" AGAIN.  Finally, out of sheer exhaustion, I went to sleep.This is a movie that gets in your head and will not get out until you figure it all out.  And that can only be done with extensive internet research. Reading ""Memento Mori"", the short story upon which the movie is ""based"" helped, too.""Memento"" is nothing short of a phenomenon.  And a brilliant one at that."
"Review of Memento : Man the utter originality of this masterpiece. Before I saw this film, I took movies only as a piece of entertainment but after seeing Memento I realised movies are ART. It took me time to release this fact but Memento opened the doors for me to watch more original & indie movies.Thank God I didn't knew first time watching that the movie was backwards, me digesting the film and then the spark of realisation that 'hey I saw that clip from before'. If I could forget this movie and again go through the journey of 'what, it is backwards!! Rewind rewind'This movie is in my Top 10.Rewatching for 2nd time, after every transition I reconnect the dots and set the movie chronologically in my brain. I love this types of movies were they made me interact.Christopher Nolan brilliantly incorporates the audience POV to the amnesia of the protagonist. This is perfectly done and I can't think of any other way to pull this kind of backwards gimmick. Thats why I love Nolan, weird concept with a masterpiece execution.The is also filled with memorable lines like 'Am I chasing him? Nope he is chasing me.' And Nolan also snuggles a twist with the female charcater and my mind is even more blow.At its core the movie the movie is about a guy finding his wife's murderer(we have seen that done hundreds of times) but the layers of other artists merit makes this movie perfect is my eyes."
"Review of Memento : If you hate reality-based film-making this is awful. If you hate Film Noir, this is ugly. But for me, Nolan has convinced me he is one of the most important directors out there. I was even thinking, ""It must be easy to edit a movie so that it's all backwards."" But it's not, it's not any easier - and he leaves you straining and watching from scene to scene, searching for the truth. Even the final revelation will affect each viewer and leaves them searching for their own ""ultimate truth"" according to their own experience.Most people comment about manipulation in connection with this movie, but after watching the last scene, I'm convinced that manipulation is not the main theme at all. I don't want to spoil it for you, but the basis of unfolding backwards in time is that you are enlisted to scrutinize the film trying to discover some set of motivations behind each character's actions later in time that makes sense. If you think you would enjoy this sort of puzzle, I think you will enjoy this excellently crafted film."
"Review of Memento : Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'Memento' was not his first film, having directed 1998's 'Following', but has been considered by many the film that rose him to fame and brought the world's attention to him. Cannot disagree with this, and also that not only is 'Memento' his first great success but seventeen years later it gets my vote as his best film. It really makes one think hard about what is happening, crucial in a film where a lot of concentration is needed, without being treated like you are an idiot or dumber than you are. It is also one of the few Nolan films where it was difficult to find anything to fault.As always with Nolan, 'Memento' is a wonderfully made film. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious , with some scenes strongly reminiscent of film noir (as a fan of film noir that was great to see). David Julyan's synthesised (something that could have sounded tacky but actually adds a lot to the atmosphere) score makes very clever and dynamic use of distinct sounds, oppression, yearning, loneliness and loss having a haunting but also affecting vibe, the feeling of being lost adrift being perfectly captured.Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and the length, after seeing some later efforts that have suffered from over-length and over-ambition ('Interstellar'), was ideal.It is the story that makes 'Memento' Nolan's most fascinating film, with a unique non-linear, time-reversed structure with two converged time-lines. That sounds on paper confusing but with Nolan telling the story in an intricate, tense and atmospheric way (meaning that he takes his time telling the story) it makes perfect sense, with beautifully interwoven use of thematic motifs of memory, guilt, perception, self-deception and grief and a stunningly moving ending that one does not expect.Guy Pearce is astonishing and give one of his career's best performances, don't think from personal view that he's been as good as this since. He gets excellent support from particularly Joe Pantoliano and even Carrie-Ann Moss.Overall, a brilliant film and a contender (my personal vote certainly) for Nolan's best film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Review of Memento : Incredible, riveting and powerful.  What else could I say?  This movie has all of the qualities of classic film noir as well as the magnitude of an original, unique concept that has been tried and tired before but works here.  Guy Pearce has been underrated for years (just think back now to Priscilla and can you believe this is the same guy) and finally might get the recognition here that was at least well-deserved of him back for LA Confidential.  Powerful perfomances, well developed story with suspensful buildup of what our main character pieces together little by little makes this a must see.Easily in my top 100 of all time."
"Review of Memento : This is by far the most original movie and engaging mystery since the Third Man. Christopher Nolan's storytelling brilliance will captivate audiences with his time twist and flipping of the story's narrative. The structure has been turned upside down and backwards giving us an incredible perspective. The film is one of a kind and it will leave people dumbfounded because of Nolan's craftiness and imagination. Absolutely the best film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2000. Nolan, has thrusted himself into the category of vanguard filmmakers, along with David Fincher, PT Anderson, Guy Ritchie & Darren Aronofsky."
"Review of Memento : ""Memento"" is one of those movies that I fear discussing because I don't know how much I can tell without giving the whole thing away. You might have heard that the story gets told in reverse and that Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, who has a memory problem. People are able to abuse him and all sorts of other horrible things. Then, he has to use the little bit of memory that he has left to...no, I can't tell you; it would give the whole movie away. My point is that ""Memento"" is a most incredible movie. You quite literally have to see it to believe it. You might even want to watch it more than once, possibly backwards. Or something similar."
"Review of Memento : Every now and then, an original concepts gets turned into an highly original movie. ""Memento"" is a fine example of original movie-making at its very best.It's impossible to fully describe what this movie is about. Best thing is to watch this movie with a clear head in order to follow the movie. But even then some parts of the movie remain confusing. Because of this ""Memento"" is a perfect movie to watch multiple times, every time you will discover a new fact or things like that. The story is told beautifully and highly original with flashbacks and jumps in time. Basically the whole same story is told over and over again but every time you get to know a little bit of more information. Sounds confusing doesn't it? Well, don't say I didn't warned you...Christopher Nolan provides this movie with a brilliantly suiting visual style and directs the movie with lots of flair and pace. Truly a good young director of which we will hear way more in the near future. He also already made real fame by the 'casual' movie viewer by directing the stylish blockbuster hit ""Batman Begins"". Not only is he a great director, he also is a great writer.The acting in the movie is really solid. Guy Pearce is a great leading man and he is supported by some wonderful actors in the supporting cast: Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano.Because that the movie and its story are so original you never know what is going to happen next. It's a typical independent movie, without any clichés or other distracting elements. Yet the movie is more accessible then it sounds. Every person should be able to appreciate this movie and be absolutely captivated by it.An unique movie experience that is highly recommendable to everyone!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Review of Memento : Leonard (Guy Pearce) has a terrible problem. After his wife was murdered and presumably he was beaten, he has no short term memory. His last recollection is the moments before his wife's demise. Now, he is determined to track down the killer the police couldn't find. Yet, everyday he must read his notes and gaze at the many tattooed phrases on his body so that he can continue. Two people appear to be helping him in his quest. One is a man named Teddy, who pops around all the time but seems rather shady. Equally so is a Natalie (Carrie Anne Moss) who is sleeping with Leonard but may have ulterior motives. Meanwhile, Leonard stays at a cheap Los Angeles Hotel where the manager introduces himself every day and, underhandedly, adds to Leonard's bill. As he crisscrosses the city looking for the murderer, the film also flashes back to his time as an insurance investigator to give us more clues. For you see, this film is designed to force the viewer to piece together the plot, bit by bit! Are you game? I finally saw this fantastic Nolan film that everyone raves about incessantly. Its worthy of the highest praise as the plot travels backwards, forwards, and sideways. Pearce is wonderful as the main character, but, one quibble, I'm not fond of him as a blonde. The supporting cast is also superb with few big names except Moss. The setting in Los Angeles has its splendors and its dives. Memento is a huge cut above most other film experiences. While you are guaranteed to be confused at times, the whole experience is very, very rewarding."
"Review of Memento : Christopher Nolan is a magician. No other way to put it.This movie ended up on my top ten list when I saw it a few years ago. It is one of the most original thrillers to have come from America and it supposedly became popular solely on the basis of word of mouth.Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce in an excellent performance) is a man who has short term memory loss. He is a man on a mission. He is determined to find out who killed his wife. He has various ways to remind himself of small facts - writing them on notes and sticking them on the wall, tattooing facts on his body and so on. The story also involves two other characters - Natalie and a man named Teddy who seems to have a shady past. There is also the story of Sammy Jenkis which is told in bits and pieces by Leonard in disjointed scenes. Sammy also had the same problem which led to Sammy being placed in a mental institution.The main feature of this movie is that it goes backwards. Which means that the scene that follows is actually the incident which happens prior to the current situation. This is quite demanding for the viewer and people with short attention spans may not appreciate this movie so much. Repeated viewings may be required to actually understand what is going on in the movie.What I liked about the movie was the fact that despite the complex and confusing style, it is ultimately a movie which is not inaccessible. It is no art film which might bore viewers to tears. It is a fast moving thriller which can keep a viewer hooked and this is what separates Memento from other such complex thrillers. Most importantly, it is the little facts and clues that are the most interesting. The loose ends are tied up expertly at the end with such brilliance that I am still at awe at the execution even several years after watching this movie.Overall, it is in fact quite depressing. There is not one likable character in this movie, except for Leonard, and we see how his medical condition is used by people to serve their own interests. It presents a bleak view of human nature, in many ways.As far as the performances are concerned, Guy Pearce is fabulous as the determined but confused Leonard Shelby. Carrie Anne moss is brilliant as the mysterious Natalie who may have other motives in helping Leonard. She has the right kind of mix of beauty and mysteriousness which make her perfect for the role. Joe Pantaliano as Teddy makes a big impact in this movie. His dry humour and screen presence make this role one of my favourite performances on film.Altogether, it is one of the best films of recent years and it is exactly the kind of movie I like.10/10"
"Review of Memento : This is based on a novel by Jonathon Nolan (Chris Nolan's brother) and starring Australian actor Guy Pearce. Huge spoilers ahead: This movie works backwards, I feel like the movie wouldn't have made a-lot of sense without me knowing going in that the story would be told backwards, but I just saw this 7/02/2020 and boy oh boy is this a masterpiece.
Basically, Leonard Shelby has this incident when his wife is getting raped and murdered by two brutal attackers, Leonard hears her screams from the bathroom rushes in and tries to fight them off, but ends up getting his head smashed into a glass mirror, and then supposedly they leave. The story is that Leonard's wife survives, she is diagnosed with diabetes and he keeps injecting her with a needle but he forgets (due to his amnesia) that he is overdosing her with the drug, and she ends up dying of an overdose. Altogether, the story is original, unique and anything you would hope for in a psychological thriller.Even though the story is quite dark, there is a humour to it. For example, character Teddy is hilarious, making jokes about Leonard's condition. Overall, this is my favorite psychological thriller by far! Grade: A+"
"Review of Memento : I was totally blown away by this movie. I think this is a total masterpiece. I wish I could have thought of something as ingenious as this. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good mystery, acting, editing, directing, plot. I can and have watched it over and over again. This should have won for best picture the year it came out. Go out and rent it. Go and watch it. Go out and buy it. you will not be disappointed. This movie is about a guy who loses his short term memory and tries to hunt down his wife's rapist and killer. I won't say anything else. It is a masterpiece, thought not perfect it probably should be about a 9.8 on the IMDb but I'll give it a 10 out of 10."
"Review of Memento : Imagine you're in a bathroom and you see a bottle of whiskey. And you have to question whether that means you're drunk.Imagine a woman gets you so angry you hit her in the face and bloody her lip. She walks out of the room, but returns in a few minutes. You ask her who hit her and she tells you some other guy's name. You vow to punish that guy.Imagine you're running down the street. Some other guy is running too. At first you think you are chasing him. Then, he fires a gun at you and you realize you are the one being chased.This is Leonard's problem. He's out to find and kill the man who killed his wife. But he can't remember what happened five minutes ago. He uses notes, tattoos and Polaroids to keep track of information he has learned. But some of this information is wrong.And get this  Leonard's mission of revenge is told in scenes that are backwards-sequenced.Ingenious. That's the only word to describe this outstanding puzzle movie. Anyone unwilling to devote very close attention to a film should avoid this one. Those willing will find it immensely rewarding.I like highly contrived movies. Ironically, I'm not a big science fiction fan because I like the contrivances to be within the realm of present-day plausibility, if that makes any sense. If you share that sensibility, check out ""Memento."""
"Review of Memento : Memento is probably one of the most unique - and confusing - movies I have ever watched.
Memento does something that few other movies have done before: it is shown backward. There are scenes shown backward, along with scenes shown forward, and the two eventually converge during the climax. And while showing a movie backward may seem like a horrible way to craft a movie, it is everything but. It shows us something that will happen, and shows us how we got there. Whether we like it or not, the ending is inevitable. The movie opens with a murder, and at first, it seems justified; the man raped and murdered the wife of our protagonist, Leonard (Guy Pierce). However, as the movie progresses, or rather digresses, we learn that the man was, in fact innocent. Leonard has a strange case of anterograde amnesia that prevents him from making new memories. Every 5 minutes, he forgets who he is, where he is, and why he is there. As a result,
he uses a complex (but heavily flawed) system of notes and photographs to understand his
everyday life. He relies on these notes to survive, and track down John Doe, the man who raped and murdered his wife. Memento has so many plot twists that it is often hard to keep up with, but in fear of spoiling for you, I will end this review here."
"Review of Memento : Memento is about a man named Leonard (Guy Pearce) who suffers from short-term memory loss. He relies on writing and taking pictures to track down the man he believes is his wife's murderer. Watching the film brings to life the feeling of memory loss and not knowing how you ended up somewhere. The story is told reverse. One scene will happen and the next scene will explain how you got to where the previous scene started and so on. So the thrilling mystery is unraveling for you just as it is for Leonard. Memento is intriguing and psychologically thrilling until the very end, or really the beginning. The film breaks all the rules of storytelling in such a perfect way that you can't look away. Memento is a must-see for anyone who wants a film like no others."
"Review of Memento : This is by far the greatest work by Chris Nolan. Everything about this particular film is simply astonishing and you could see it from a mile away. The superb writing is out of this world. There is no other movie like Memento, no other movie that could take the audience through such a unique experience. So many emotions are felt throughout this film and still, by the time you've finished it, it will leave you wanting more because that's how great this film is. Not only the writing was perfect, but also the direction part. Nolan did an amazing job in introducing us to this fictional world, that everything felt almost real. The way he combined the black&white scenes with the ""colored"" ones was simply unique. There is nothing like it. Then, the acting was impeccable as well. Although this film might be a bit too difficult to understand for some viewers, there are still a lot of things to enjoy from this experience even if you don't understand the movie completely! As a conclusion, I simply adore and recommend this film with all my heart, because it is without a question one of the greatest and most unique films of all time and this is all thanks to the great Chris Nolan!"
"Review of Memento : If you have watched the very first movie done by Mr. Nolan, than yes you have seen this before. Not exactly like this and with quite a few flaws, but if you consider that it was more or less a student film and seeing this, probably nothing more than an exercise on how to do it on a grand scale, than it was more than decent.Nolan is one my new favorite directors and as the rating does show you here, I am not alone. Not that that will convince you he is better than you think he is. Actually you might even not like Memento, for one reason or another. There is people out there who just want to be entertained, when they go watch a movie. And that's not a bad thing. Nor does that mean that if someone likes, say Transformers 2 better than this movie, that he/she has no clue. It's just a matter of taste.I for one, can tell you that this is a movie that merits watching it more than once. And the disc version offers you to watch the movie ... in a different ""order"", which gives you a new unique experience. If you haven't watched it yet, you are in for treat. And don't worry, if you don't understand everything the first time you watch it ..."
"Review of Memento : Watch this movie, but you have to watch it twice. Back to back. While on mushrooms. In 2020. I promise. It's... Yeah."
"Review of Memento : Leonard (Guy Pearce) suffers from short term memory loss. His last permanent memory is an attack by two men. He killed the one who killed his wife. The other one escaped after clubbing him in the head. The police dismisses the idea of a second man. He keeps a record of his experiences using tattoos, Polaroids and hidden notes. He has to figure out whether he can trust Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) or Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) as he searches for the second man to avenge his wife.Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan announce their arrival with this unique screenplay. The forward-reverse order makes the movie disjointed and confused in a good way. It's a beautiful struggle to figure out the plot. It puts the audience in Leonard's shoes. It's a jigsaw puzzle that Leonard with his memory loss also struggles with."
"Review of Memento : I spent considerable time doing research on the brain for a class I was teaching.  One of the most intriguing things I dealt with was the idea of short term memory.  There are cases of people who carry around a suitcase with them, containing all the things they need to continually review to stay in the present with any sort of functionality.  I had heard about this film and read a very sketchy review.  I rented it because I knew my family wouldn't be interested in the violence.  So late at night, I sat and took this film in with total concentration.  I need to watch it again, but right now it may have cracked my top ten list.  The last time I was so enthralled by a film was Coppola's ""The Conversation.""  Both of these films are fairly bleak and occasionally confusing and absolutely captivating. How anyone can be bored by this with all the junk that is being produced these days, I will never understand.  I know it's a gimmick film.  I know it's manipulative. So what?  Don't all films manipulate us, especially those steeped in mystery and suspense.  I knew exactly what was going on and I couldn't wait to see how it ended (began).  At first there are so many questions--why the self mutilation?  Why are these people treating this man this way?  Where is he?  How did he get there?  Who does he work for?  Does he actually work for anyone?  And yet, how skillfully is is all done.  I suppose if you want to begin nit picking, you can come up with a few inconsistencies.  This doesn't detract from the way that the principle character floats from even to even, trying to recoup his memory each time he faces the day.  The one thing I will grant is the emotional investment required for revenge--but because he is aware of his shortcomings, he feels he must act.  If  you are bored with most movies these days, rent this and it will affect you for a long time."
"Review of Memento : This unique and well-crafted tale is a top-notch thriller packed with suspense, excellent characterisation, and a style of story-telling which means the viewer has to use his or her brain for a change. Unsurprisingly it seems to have been ignored by the mainstream crowd, but in any case it's one of the best (if not THE best) films of 2000. Guy Pearce is outstanding in the leading role of Leonard, a man who has developed a short-term memory loss syndrome since a horrific accident which means he cannot remember anything for longer than twenty minute intervals. Thus he is forced to tattoo clues on his body and take Polaroids to remind himself of his quest, which is to hunt for the man who raped and murdered his wife and kill him.The genius thing about this film is that it starts at the end (Leonard begins the film by killing the man responsible) and goes back to the beginning. I was pretty sceptical of how this would work but director Christopher Nolan has done himself proud. The style of story-telling involves one scene ending and the next scene finishing at the beginning of the previous one. Confusing at first, but don't worry as Nolan takes things slowly, giving the viewer time to get used to the method before hitting them with two-faced characters, plot twists, and some tense situations. The film is extremely suspenseful in that you really get inside Leonard's head and can sympathise with his plight and the unusual story makes for lots of interesting situations and ideas. On top of this, there's a breath-taking surprising twist ending (or is that beginning?) which rewards the viewer for watching and is as good as any I've seen beforehand (THE USUAL SUSPECTS or otherwise). The film is technically excellent, the supporting cast brilliant, and I can't fathom why Nolan or Pearce failed to get Oscars for their parts in this. Seek it out now."
"Review of Memento : If the director of this independent film tried to make us feel really confused, like the main character, he did it wonderfully. There are only a few movies like this one, the kind of movies that makes you pay attention to every minute of it. Obviously that doesn't work all the time, but this case is the exception. Really well directed with a wonderful photography and excellent cast. The main actors' performances are great. We really root for the guy as we hate the ones who try to take advantage of him.Original films like this one always stand out. Perhaps it didn't caught much attention at first but now it is in an important position at the IMDb top 250 and that means that most the people recognize great movies when they see them.As I said before, this movie is a little confusing because it runs backwards while the black and white scenes run in chronological order. But that wasn't a cheap trick to make the movie more ""intelectual"", it was its strength. A rare film that shouldn't be missed."
"Review of Memento : Yes, it's true.  The entire movie is based on a gimmick.  However, I honestly feel that this does not cheapen the picture in the slightest bit. I loved every scene; discovering information as our lead character discovered it. It demands a second and third viewing, as there are many subtleties and quick flashes that may not be picked up on the first time around.  Its one of the most original films ever made, and for people who scoff at the concept of not having a short-term memory, it actually is a real condition. Watch this movie. And, please pay attention. The performances are wonderful, and its structured magnificently."
"Review of Memento : Revising such film noir conventions as a story told through the unreliable point of view and voice-over narration of a morally flawed investigator-protagonist, the pervasive infusion of a dark past into the narrative present, and the use of a femme fatale as an embodiment of evil allure, Memento is perhaps the most original and intriguing revision of the genre since Welles' Touch of Evil.As almost every commentator has noted, the most startling (or 'gimmicky') feature of Memento - and one with obvious roots in the film noir tradition - is its inverted/contorted plot structure. The film loops backwards episodically to present a series of revelations about the main character, Lenny (Guy Pearce), about the motives of his antagonists 'Teddy' (Joe Pantolino) and 'Natalie' (Carrie Ann Moss), and about the nature of Lenny's memory-loss condition. His condition 'isn't amnesia' (or so Lenny tells everyone he meets) but rather such severe short term memory loss that he is unable to assimilate and retain experience - in other words, to make new memories. Consequently, Lenny's identity, or more precisely his self-knowledge, is arrested at the moment he received a blow to his head while trying to stop intruders from raping his wife.Everything that has happened thereafter has no subjective reality for Lenny, only whatever 'objective' reality he can forge using instant photos, notes to himself, and - for the really important stuff - tattoos. But matters are even more complex and paradoxical than this setup might lead one to expect. Gradually, the viewer learns that even the clear memories that Lenny claims to have from before the assault are, like dreams, colored by protective distortions and selectivity. Moreover the so-called facts he has assembled in his investigation and that he defensively claims are more reliable than memory turn out to be irretrievably entangled in subjective motives: his own, Teddy's, and Natalie's. Thus the viewer's initial sympathy for Lenny as a justifiable victim/avenger transforms to horror as Lenny's true current identity becomes clear.Importantly, Memento's regressive plot structure is punctuated and counter-pointed by a series of noirish black and white flashbacks in which Lenny relates to an anonymous phone caller the story of Sammy Jankis, another sufferer of short term memory loss who, ironically, was Lenny's big case in his pre-trauma life as an insurance investigator. Unlike the main narrative, the Sammy sequences are told in chronological order, strategically intersecting and organizing the narrative as it wends its way backwards to the moment when Lenny decides to set in motion the data trail that will lead to the murder we see him commit in the film's opening sequence. In addition, Lenny's reconstruction of the Sammy sequences is itself dreamlike and unreliable since he attributes to Sammy characteristics that (if we can believe Teddy, an utterly corrupt cop) are Lenny's own.In addition to providing plot exposition and a recurring visual/narrative reference point, the Sammy sequences also bring into clear thematic focus the existential implications of memory loss. Like Sammy's, Lenny's 'condition' is a reduction to the most minimal and absurd level of the human mental processes for constructing meaning (in life, in film) out of fragmentary phenomena and evanescent recollections. In an age of Alzheimer's, deconstruction, and ego-fictions, most viewers will all-too-easily identify with Lenny's painfully hopeless and terrifyingly arbitrary quest to hold reality steady as is it fizzles and flits away."
"Review of Memento : A unique premise presented in a non-linear film; is structured in a way that comes together clearly, and provides an unpredictable twist that leaves every character involved in a moral grey area.Everything about this movie ranges from great to excellent. I don't know what more could you ask for."
"Review of Memento : Memento sees Guy Pearce play Leonard Shelby, a man with no short term memory, on a search for his wife's killer in a film which is intelligent, engaging, well thought out, and sometimes, even funny. Memento demands your full concentration, and its backwards development is a stroke of genius, placing you in the same situation as Leonard; you see what he sees, and aside from small clues, very little else. This way of engaging its audience is what makes Memento special, as it draws you into the plot and Leonard's complex situation without leaving you lost amidst the chronology or bogged down in little clues. This is also helped by Guy Pearce's performance; he remains likable for most of the film, his little jokes and his honesty helping you side with him, but he also shows evidence of a darker side, especially towards the end (the beginning?), as Teddy (Pantoliano) plants the seed of doubt in his mind.Basically, Memento is a very good film, an intelligent, engaging storyline that keeps you interested even after it ends."
"Review of Memento : I just watched this picture three times in five days, and before you get around to asking - no, I'm not a glutton for punishment. It's just that I was totally fascinated with the way the story was presented, as if it was rigged with a perpetual rewind button that brings the viewer back a couple days prior to the last rewind. These kinds of stories have a way of making my head hurt, but there was something about this one that was different. Maybe it's the way the story had you empathizing with Guy Pearce's character Lenny. The man was relentless in his quest to find his wife's murderer, but at the same time, that murder might not have ever really happened. There are literally as many interpretations of this picture as there are people who have seen it, and reading some of the other viewer posts and discussion threads are bound to move even the firmest of opinions to yet another different conclusion. So in that respect, the film invites criticism for being nothing more than a gimmick, even if a thought provoking and mind bending gimmick. I have to say, I usually like my movies wrapped up in forthright fashion, even if I don't like the resolution. But here it's virtually impossible to know anything for sure because it's all based on Lenny's reconstruction of events, relying on facts and not memories, as he explains in one of the sequences to Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). But what happens when the facts can metamorphose as they did here? I just know I can't watch this again for awhile because I've come to enough different conclusions already."
"Review of Memento : It is refreshing to see a (relatively) mainstream thriller that does not follow the tired old rules, that uses Resnais, rather than Mel Gibson, as a starting point, that substitutes for an inevitable linear plot a temporal time bomb, where the straight line of events is smashed to pieces and put together with seeming haphazardness.  Further, this plot is told completely from one character's point-of-view, a character as we by now know, with short-term memory.  His great boast is that he remembers his identity and memory up until the accident - the denouement suggests that even this is a myth.So what is the plot we're watching?  Has the emotional shock of finally getting revenge had the required, cathartic effect, and that Leonard Shelby is now piecing back the bits of remembered past?  Or is he, in effect, a dead man, if we agree that someone does not exist as an identity without memory, exists in a kind of limbo, and that this dead Leonard is watching his life flashing before (or behind) him?  As all the 'revelations' at the end take place in the narrative's begining, Leonard is denied all the action hero's usual rewards - increased self-knowledge, knowledge of the world and the plot.  He is given the answers at the start of his plot, and forgets them.  Leonard at the end (his beginning) is a more coherent character than at the beginning (his end) - is this just because we've given a mass of (highly dubious) information by then and think we know him and his situation better?  Or is he, as his narrative progresses, getting vaguer, moving towards inertia, the catatonia that finally swamped his altar-ego Sammy Jankis.  Our problem is that the film comprises not one plot, but four, all fragmented, full of gaping black holes, all mediated by this character who knows nothing.  One is Leonard's narrative as he sees it, as he tries to avenge his wife's murder.  The second is told in monochrome flashback (or whatever this is called in a film that runs backward), mostly told in mysterious phone calls, and seem to flesh out the gaps missing in the first plot, but actually creates more. The third is the 'real' plot that may have something to do with cops, snitches, femmes fatales, or may be hallucinated, misremembered by Leonard, or simply planted there as cover for another plot, or may not even exist at all.  The fourth is the story of Sammy, who suffered the same 'condition' as Leonard.All four are obviously connected with each other to create a discordant fugue, but each undermines the other; in a sense, hell is other plots, and Leonard is in hell.  We can only take the opening sequence, where Leonard stands holding a fading photograph over a dead man's bloody body as the only 'reliable' image, and in this 'reliable' image, another, the photograph, is slipping away, ungraspable, like Leonard's memory, like the film.In another sense, though, what this film does is what any detective story does, which is work its way bakwards from the crime to its source.  This is what Dupin, Holmes and Poirot do, followed by legions of TV and movie detectvies.  This film just takes this journey literally.  In a conventional detective story, this travelling into the past is a way of making the present and future safe, of reasserting order, of filling up the gaps.  As Leonard doesn't succeed in reaching the source, and as the audience flounders too, there can be no reassertion of present and future. 
Leonard is the logical conclusion of a long line of anti-detectives, figures who do not solve the crime, who are personally implicated in the investigation, and are eventually destroyed by it.  'Vertigo''s Scottie Ferguson is the most famous example, others include 'The Spider's Strategem', 'Blow-up' and 'The Parallax View'.  These films offer detectives who do not order chaos, who cannot reorder the world, in the way Holmes used to.  Crime, solution and detective get lost in a temporal vacuum, never to be saved.  These abstractions are firmly grounded in 'Memento' in the body and the eye; Guy Pearce's rather splendid physique as palimpsest, where history is recorded at random, where the keys of interpretation are lost.  The split between mind and body is complete, and with it the essence of our unified humanity.  Similarly, with all the Polaroids he takes, the camera may never lie, but, as discrete entities, images are meaningless, in narrative terms anyway."
"Review of Memento : It's not until a film like Memento comes along, or that you personally have to deal with someone close who suffers a form of this subject to hand, that you get jolted to remember just how your memory is such a prized and treasured thing - and crucially that it's one of your key safety devices.Christopher and Jonathan Nolan crafted one of the best films of 2000 based on those facets of the human condition. Their protagonist is Leonard Shelby, played with stupendous believability by Guy Pearce, who is suffering from a memory amnesia caused by a trauma to the head as he tried to aide his wife who was raped and murdered. He can remember things before the incident, but anything post that and he can't form a memory. So who can he trust? Does he know any of the few people who appear to be in his life at the present time? He tattoos his body to help him remember, constantly writes notes to keep him alert in his now alien world, while all the time he is on the search for the man who ruined his life.Christopher Nolan plants the audience right into Leonard's world. By using a reverse story telling structure it's deliberately complex and ingenious given that it opens with the ending! It has been argued that it's trickery for trickery sake, style over substance, but the way each scene is built upon in the narrative is a thing of high quality, it's all relevant and demands the closest of attention from the viewer, where cheekily we are ourselves asked to form memories of prior narrative passages. Mystery is strong throughout, the characters currently in Leonard's life may have different means and motives, it keeps us alert, with the confusion, lies, manipulations, enigmas and amnesia angles booming with neo-noir vibrancy. And the Nolan's know their noir of course, adding a narrator who is hard to define or trust himself!The reverse structure wasn't new in 2000, but Christopher Nolan picks up the idea and adds new strands to it, simultaneously bringing his visual ticks as David Julyan's musical score shifts from elegiac forebodings to pulse pounding dread, and as evidenced by the darling easter egg option that allows one to watch it in chronological order, it's a damn fine thriller without the reverse trickery anyway. Super. 9/10"
"Review of Memento : Quite simply this is one of the best films I've seen with actors and actresses of whom I've barely seen. This is NOT a cult film which is popular by some weird twist of fate. This IS a solid film; well acted, directed and definitely well written. Although I have seen this basic plot twice before, I haven't seen it in a movie or so well done. The combination of Leonard's brain damage and the reverse chronologic filming allow one of the most bizarre plot twists I've seen. Thespian for Thespian, one of the best-done films to come out of Hollywood."
Review of Memento : Non-lineal storytelling at its best by Christopher Nolan. Watched this multiple times. Guy Pearce's best role also.
"Review of Memento : Memento is a very unique thriller. It's very imaginative, original, and absorbing, and I'm guessing you wouldn't have seen anything quite like it.It demonstrates a very powerful and thought-provoking message that 'we all tell lies to ourselves.The film's structure is told in a non-linear fashion involving two timelines. Ultimately we begin at the end of the story and work our way back to the beginning.It's filmed in both color and black-and-white sequences, with the latter showing the events of Leonard's story in an easier-to-understand, chronological order.At first, it might seem quite difficult to follow and, while as a viewer you are puzzled from the outset, we start to realize that we are meant to feel confused, and disoriented as if were are the one in Leonards's shoes.We have the same feelings, thoughts, and ideas as our main protagonist. This means most of the film is also a mystery to us and left scrambling to put together the scattered pieces of Leonard's past.Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is unable to create new memories. He has short-term memory loss and received this 'condition' after he was hit over the head by a break-in at his home, which led to the rape and murder of his wife.He recalls a case from his Insurance industry days regarding another person with the same 'condition' named Sammy Jankis who he initially believed was faking his condition as Sammy could not learn new things through repetition. And so he recollects techniques such as sticky notes, polaroid photographs, and tattoos to help form his lost memory.Leonard is manipulated, and taken advantage of by many people throughout the film, which gives him little choice but to trust only himself.You develop sympathy for his condition, and what he has to go through each day for the rest of his life.There are so many twists and turns that Memento keeps you guessing, and your mind constantly racing for answers. I think you will be stunned by the ending when all the secrets are finally revealed.Guy Pearce was phenomenal, and this was easily his most memorable role to date. He was assisted by having such a diverse, and powerful role but he makes it his own. You believe him to be the real Leonard Shelby.This is a film that you need to be switched on, and keenly focused on to understand all the little details that make the film bind together. Very similar to 'The Machinist' starring Christian Bale.Take away all background noise, and fully immerse yourself in the story, and I guarantee that you will have an unforgettable experience.9/10."
"Review of Memento : This is one of Nolan's earlier works, and I must admit that it is still as impressive as some of his later ones. Okay, it certainly isn't as confusing as, say, Tenet, but it really is quite mind bending in a lot of ways, especially since a bulk of the film actually goes backwards, and there is a really good reason for this. Yeah, the film starts at the end, and moves to the middle (while cutting back and forth to the part of the film that is heading forward to the middle) to where the big reveal actually is.The film is about this guy, Leonard, who suffers from Anterograde amnesia - that is that he can't retain memories. As such he resorts to a number of ways to remind himself of things, such as tattooing important things to his body, and taking photographs and making notes on these photographs. His mission is to find the man who murdered his wife, and put him into this state. Yeah, it's the same condition that the woman in Fifty First Dates has, but this film is much, much better.That is actually the reason why Nolan has the film go backwards, so as to give you, the viewer, the feeling that you actually suffer from the same condition that Leonard does, and that you are just as mystified by all of the notes as he is. This is the same with all of the characters that he interacts with, namely because you pretty much know as much about them as he does. This is what makes the film so intriguing because as you head back in time, more is revealed, and characters that you initially thought were nice, turn out not to be so. Like there is this constant reference about why Leonard is wearing these specific clothes, and the car that he is driving, and at the beginning of the film there doesn't seem to be an issue.Another of the great things about this film is that pretty much everybody is unreliable. Leonard is clearly unreliable because he can't remember anything. As for Teddy, well, we are constantly reminded not to trust Teddy everytime Leonard looks at the photo, so of course he is unreliable, but we also ask ourselves whether there is any truth to this or not. I won't say anything else because that will no doubt completely ruin the film. Hey, even the guy at the desk in the motel is unreliable.What is surprising is that this is quite a low budget film, which is surprising coming from Nolan, but then again you really do have to start off small and work your way up, as well as get involved in some more mainstream work. However, if you like Nolan's work, and love how he messes around with time, then this is definitely a film to watch."
"Review of Memento : This movie is by far the most original I have ever seen.
Keeps you guessing till the end.
Some memories are so painful you would rather forget."
"Review of Memento : I became a fan of Christopher Nolan after I saw Batman Begins and I must say Memento is another spectacular addition to his repertoire.This is unlike any movie you will see. Lenny, aka Guy Pearce, is searching for the man ""he thinks"" killed his wife. He has a condition known as anterograde amnesia, which means he has no short-term memory. He developed this condition after suffering a TBI the night he and his wife were attacked in their home. This is the same night he ""thinks"" his wife was killed. He must put tattoos all over his body and gather every clue he can to find ""the killer"".Truly a classic in the suspense and mystery categories. Very unique the way the movie is shown with flashbacks in color and the present in B&W until the time periods meet. See this movie!!!!"
"Review of Memento : Memento is undoubtedly one of Christopher Nolan's best movie of his career. Though, it is not a commercial movie as it doesn't falls in the mainstream cinema.Still it manages to influence us.The plot revolves around a guy named Leonard Shelby or Lenny (Guy Pearce) who suffers from amnesia and tries to find the person who raped and killed his wife. He just can't make new memories. So, he uses notes, tattoos and Polaroid cameras to make new memories. One thing is that, the story runs backwards, jumping back and forth after every scene, which creates a suspense. Guy pearce has done a good acting, neither too bland nor too overreacting.The problem with it is that, it couldn't explain how can he remember that he is amnesiac. It's a major plot hole. Also, the suspense created doesn't result in some extraordinary or satisfying result."
"Review of Memento : A man (Guy Pearce), suffering from short-term memory loss, uses notes and tattoos to hunt for the man he thinks killed his wife.Although Christopher Nolan had previously made ""Following"" and a short film, this was easily the film that catapulted him to worldwide success, landed him the Batman franchise, and made him one of the greatest directors working today. Although it may not be a fair assessment, the fact almost every one of his films has been in the Top 100 on IMDb suggests he has a magic touch not seen since the days of Kubrick or Hitchcock.This was also a great role for Pearce. He has been known for ""The Time Machine"", ""LA Confidential"", and more recently ""Iron Man 3"", but I think he will always be remembered for ""Memento"". He was, after all, the driving force behind the film in the acting department, appearing in basically every scene and conveying a wide range of emotions... the fact Pearce is not one of the highest-paid actors in the world is a bit unfortunate, because he can hold his own with the likes of Christian Bale and Daniel Day-Lewis."
"Review of Memento : I had grave doubts going into this one. Its fans seemed to me to be the same people who like a lot of the movies I really hated over the past five years or so, movies like The Matrix, Run Lola Run, Fight Club, and many others. I avoided it for a long time, though I always thought I had to see it no matter what. And when the chance to see it for free came along, I jumped at it. Fortunately, Memento lives up to the hype. It's one of the few movies that can. Seriously, I wouldn't doubt that this movie will one day be counted as one of the best ever made. Perhaps not the ninth best ever, its current position on the imdb top 250, but it will certainly have its place in the history books.The main reason for this is its unique narrative structure. Add this one to the ranks of Citizen Kane for its high level of narrative innovation. What it does is it tells its story backwards. It will give us one large chunk of narrative information, stop, and then rewind to the last place Leonard (Guy Pearce) began his small chunk of memory. You see, Leonard has this condition where he has little short-term memory. After a few minutes, he forgets everything that has happened to him since a serious injury. He reminds himself of his purpose every time he wakes up in a new chunk of memory through hosts of photos and notes that he has written to himself. His purpose: to avenge his dead wife. She was raped, and her rapist knocked poor Lenny on his head. This condition, which is the foundation of the narrative structure, is clearly false. You just have to suspend your disbelief as you watch, and, I promise you, you'll see something very unique.The best thing about this film is that it gives you some real mental exercise. It asks you to remember a large amount of information. Add to that the fact that not everything is trustworthy, and that truth and memory and facts and everything that we take for granted are constantly being questioned and warped, and you've got yourself an enjoyable uphill battle.
The rest of the film is equally commendable, which ought to be remembered as long as you can retain it. The acting is quite good, especially Joe Pantoliano, so good in Bound, and Carrie-Anne Moss, with whom I was quite unimpressed in The Matrix. Here, she shows that she can play a complex character and that her main assets aren't her T&A. Guy Pearce is also quite good, though he was perhaps better in L.A. Confidential. I think someone else might have brought a bit more depth to the part, but perhaps not. One of the most difficult things about his role is the fact that he really has no complexities - he's a blank slate. One could honestly call him simply a tool of the plot. However, someone who would say that would be missing the fact that he is often being used as a tool by other characters. Christopher Nolan is not just a master scenarist, he's also an excellent director. Also great is the cinematography, sharp color with some spatterings of black and white.Perhaps there are some plot holes, but I didn't notice them. This is truly a masterpiece, a film to remember. 10/10."
"Review of Memento : I also have frantically started writing. I want to make note of the movie lest I forget it. The movie has ingrained a sense of condition in me as well. Leonard says the memory can change, the color of the car can change. True?? One of the puzzling pieces was the presence of a picture of Lenny bare chested and happy. It doesn't have a caption and he doesn't question why. He is conditioned you see, he is confident. Leonard believes he can lead the life as the police conducts investigation, taking notes, relying on facts. Well, the problem is what are facts? All in all, a puzzling movie and it drives the viewer also into the whirlwind of thinking. It challenges your notions of being, notions of certainty. It's not just a movie, it's more than that. ""Memento"" is an episode in your life which presses you hard."

SO, I have to make more sentences following other's will,not my own.Leonard did the same thing during the most time,as an avenger deserving pity---he complied with the rules he made:recording the truth.AS a psycho,a chain killer can be regard as an innocent person,especially in the eye of law.But when facts prove that this killer has self-controllability,he is not innocent any more.WHEN he chose to record the unreal information,he abused his self-controllability.THE in-between sentences are superfluous words.I don't wanna break the rules.IN the movie,the first and the last are the what and the why,and my comments share the same CONDITION."
"Review of Memento : This movie is absolutely genius and although I love it, there are some negatives that I will quickly run through.First off, the cinematography and visuals are very boring and not at all memorable (apart from the photographs and the parts in black and white). I understand that this is partly because of the budget but also because it fits the narrative of the film really well, but this doesn't take away from the fact that they are uninspiring and frankly quite boring. The score and sound design were not particularily great either, I can't even seem to remember if there was any music at all. My third and final complaint is about the acting. While the actors sometimes shined and truly showed the pain and tragedy of memory loss, most often the performances were quite bland and not something I will remember about this film.The story, writing, and directing, however, was absolutely brilliant. In true Nolan fashion, he has created a wonderfully complex, interesting and truly unique story that is told in a very original and captivating way. It gives you something to think about, and the way it is all connected as well as how it gives us information and reveals, is extremely rewarding. Thank you, Cristopher Nolan, for this fantastic movie. I will not forget it for a long time."
"Review of Memento : This film is for those who like mysteries, or are in school to learn how to make a good film script, or who are at least of average intelligence.  The lower life forms, such as NASCAR/Wrestling fans and bowlers need not apply --- go see The Flintstones, Part 8 in 3D.  I have never had the pleasure of watching a film which progressed completely backwards in time & frame sequence.  You could literally watch this film from the last scene to the first and it would make sense, maybe even more sense, except of course that you would watch the true ending first and spoil it for yourself.  What's really cool is that there's a slight narrative story within the story that is moving forward --- it's really ingenious.This is a classic in the making; completely original in all aspects.  This is something that I'm sure Hitchcock would have liked to do if he or anybody had thought of it before.  There are plot holes, but incredibly, you don't notice them badly and they don't have to be resolved to enjoy the film.  The script even mentions at least one, and you have to stop and think for a moment to find the others --- if Leonard can make no new memories, what good is a revenge killing if he won't remember the satisfaction of it, or even if he has even exacted revenge already --- in fact, what good is doing anything other than just existing and waiting for a cure, but then you wouldn't have a movie, eh?  These questions were posed by the story which inspired the film and of course were omitted for sake of argument and they do not spoil the continuity one bit.  The introduction of certain elements of the plot are not mentioned and left up to the viewer to decipher, and another big hole --- if Leonard can't remember anything, how does he remember how to drive a car, how does he even know that the Polaroids he takes are in his pocket, and how does he know about anything he has done more than 30 minutes ago which are essential to functioning in life in general?  There are also elements of certain characters that fail to resolve themselves, but you can live with them as well --- what you get in return is a heckuva neo-Noir flick that deserves your attention.If you will suspend belief as you should when you see any film and manage to hold on for the first 30 minutes until the plot thickens, you will get an incredible payoff.  In fact, this will be a film that you will want to watch again the very moment it ends to take stock of what just happened and the time frames and appreciate the mastery of the plot & screenplay fully and even discuss what you just saw with someone, as you may have a time figuring out what you just saw!  The filmmakers left a little of the story in your hands to allow you to decide what you just saw, but not so much (like ""K-PAX"") that you feel like you were left with an incomplete storyline.Thumbs straight up on this one, and you MUST get the DVD version to really appreciate this film."
"Review of Memento : Sometimes a move is so complicated it has to be seen twice; once forward and once backward. Memento is such a movie.We already saw it in reverse; now lets run the scenes forward. The advantage of renting a DVD is that you can explore the inside. Not that the movie was too hard to understand; it's just that the writer/director, Nolan, left so much out. The special features tell you that that memory-man did indeed cause his wife's death and that he had escaped from an asylum to seek the ""killers"" of his wife. All this is alluded to in the movie but since most of it comes from the Pantoliano character, you don't know what to believe.The characters played by Pantoliano and Carrie-Ann Moss are especially hard to pin down. When do they lie or tell the truth?In fact then the audience is intentionally left in the dark the same way memory man is confused. That is the beauty of the movie. Is it necessary to know all during the playing of the story? The answer is no. Because, the not knowing keeps the interest and the concentration level maximized throughout the playing of the tale. It is only afterward that you want to talk it out with a friend or read about it from the DVD."
"Review of Memento : For people who love to see movies with excellent scripts, psychologic effects and complicated plots, this movie is a must see one! The movie is about Lenny, who suffers from Anterograde Amnesia. This is a memory disease which enables the sufferer to make new memories. So, every day, he experience everything totally new. For example, every human being he has met after his disease onset is seen by him as a totally new person to meet. With this disease, he hunts the people who murdered his wife. The most brilliant thing about this movie is that it is played totally backwards: when the movie starts, you see the final scene. After that, the movie takes you back, scene by scene, to the beginning. In this way, the movie makes you experience it a bit like Lenny. You have to orientate everytime the movie goes one scene back, which makes this movie a bit complicated to follow. But, I can tell you, you will get rewarded with an absolute brilliant ending (or beginning!). Last but not least, Guy Pierce, who´s playing Lenny, gives away his best actors performance of his career so far. After having actors like de Niro and Pacino, we finally get a couple of new great actors in Hollywood.I would say that we have waited long for new great actors, but after Kevin Spacey and Russel Crowe, we´ve got two coming men: Edward Norton and the leading man of this movie: Guy Pierce. To movielovers I dare to say: don´t miss Memento and keep a close watch to Guy Pierce, he really is a coming man."
"Review of Memento : MEMENTO / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:	How is this for a scenario? A man breaks into your house in the middle of the night. He kills your wife and leaves you with brain injuries. Furious, you pledge your life to track down and kill whoever is responsible. There is just one problem: after the head injury, you are no longer capable of creating new memories; everything before the accident is crystal clear, but now you cannot remember anything past several minutes.	Now chew on this: what happens to guilt if you cannot remember what you did? How can a person have emotions if he does not know where they came from? How can we learn from our experiences if we cannot remember them. What is the purpose of revenge if someone cannot recollect or prosper from it?
	""Memento"" wins this year's prize for inducing the most audience participation. Not only is the film thought-provoking and unusually absorbing, but it also places us in the main character's shoes. How can we be in the same mental status with the main character when he cannot remember anything? Writer/director Christopher Nolan has that answer: he tells the story backwards. We begin at the end and work our way towards the beginning. However, each individual scene plays running forward, often overlapping, providing us with clear, constructive transitions. The main character, Leonard, is confused in prospects of time and experience, and so are we.	Other characters include Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss, from ""The Matrix""), who also lost someone close and can help Leonard, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano, also from ""The Matrix""), whose identity often shifts mysteriously. Then there is the series of flashbacks of Leonard's experiences while working as an insurance agent. The situation involves an individual named Sammy, who has a memory disorder similar to Leonard's. His diabetic spouse is not sure whether her husband is faking his condition or not. To prove it to herself she arranges a test I dare not reveal. Leonard is more intricately involved in this story than he even believes.  	""Memento"" is smart and imaginative. It doesn't pass up little details of the characters. Leonard is constantly jotting himself notes and taking Polaroid pictures so his life can make some sense. He even gets permanent tattoos all over his body so he does not lose or forget some of the most important information. In a movie like this, it would be almost impossible to make without leaving some information out; even some of the film's actors were confused and requested a script told in sequence order. But these filmmakers have constructed a movie with a plot hole big enough to drive a semi through: If Leonard cannot remember anything after the accident, then how can he remember that he has a memory condition? There are no tattoos or notes to remind him, and whenever he meets someone he explains his condition thoroughly. This is necessary information he reveals, but there are better ways to do so. We could be there when his doctor explains the condition to him, or see his friends talking about it. The sky is the limit in a movie like this. It was not essential to leave such a massive, obvious hole in the plot. ""Memento"" is still a unique mystery thriller. It is a tantalizing experience we do not often come across at the movies. For audiences who like to sit back and relax, this film is a waste of time. It requires us to follow along, participate, fit puzzle pieces together-""Memento"" doesn't provide any easy or obvious answers. All but the most intelligent and thoughtful kids will not be able to follow this film; it is intended for adult audiences. ""Memento"" is one of the year's most challenging movies, not to be missed if you are looking for something clever and original."
"Review of Memento : Excellent movie. This movie shows Nolan's early spirit in movie making, as this is his second feature film. However this is not for everyone. Even if you're a die-hard Nolan fan, you still might not like it. It was in my cup of tea, so I loved it. The movie is a complete mind bender. It doesn't play in order. It jumps from the past to present a TON of times, so it can be a hell lot of confusing. It's a slow movie, but fantastic. It grabs your attention from the start till the end. The suspense builds stronger as every second ticks by. If you haven't seen it go see it now, because in the second part of my review I'm going to talk about the ending. The ending is something to talk about. There is a plot twist at the end, rather twistS. It is one of the most unpredictable twists ever.Spoiler Alert!As many of you have seen the movie, you will know the ending is completely mind blowing. I never expected that Leo had killed the attacker over a year ago, and that now he kept forgetting and believed that the killer is still alive. Also another crazy twist was when Teddy told Leo that Leo's wife survived the attack, and that Leo himself killed her by accident with an insulin overdose. The real shocker was when it was revealed that Leo was mixing Sammy's life with his life. Everything that was said about Sammy, indeed revealed Leo's life. Totally mind blowing. There were like 3-4 twists at the end, which blew me away. To be honest, I didn't even expect one of the twists. I was blown away because there were many twists at the end, and none of them were predictable. From all the movies I've seen this movie had the second biggest twist ending, right after ""The Prestige"", also by Nolan.This movie is very suspenseful and interesting. It doesn't let your interest leave until the very end. In short, fantastic movie and it deserves at least one watch. For me many more watches. Nolan never disappoints. Not one of his movies disappointed me, and I've seen all his movies, including his short films."
"Review of Memento : Protagonist Leonard has an unusual condition; he can't form any new memories; anything that happens to him fades from his memory in a matter of minutes. He explains that he still recall events that took place before the night that he came home and discovered his wife being raped and murdered. He is hunting for the killer; to make this possible he must keep notes and take photographs to remind him who the people in his life are now, the most important facts he has tattooed onto his body. In the opening scenes we see him driving to a remote location with a man called Teddy; he looks through his pictures and on the back of Teddy's picture is says that he is the killer Leonard shoots and kills the man.Because of the way the story is told this is actually the end; as the film progresses two narratives unfold; on, in black and white, moves forward, and the other, in colour, gradually moves backwards. As the two narratives converge we learn more about Leonard as well as Teddy and a woman called Natalie who helped him.This early film from director Christopher Nolan is gripping and manages to avoid being too confusing as we gradually learn more about the characters. As time passes it becomes apparent that Leonard is a far from reliable narrator thanks to his condition. The way time is played with gives an idea of what Leonard's life is like; he can only trust his notes and what people tell him; not easy when his notes tell him not to trust certain people. When the truth is finally exposed it comes as quite a surprise despite hints that we have seen. The cast does a really good job; Guy Pearce does a great job as he captures Leonard's condition in a believable way, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are also great as Natalie and Teddy. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting a thriller that is different check this out; you might want to watch it again though as I suspect many details will improve on a second viewing."
"Review of Memento : This is a decent movie, it's in no way a masterpiece/classic! People rating this a 10 or a 4 star movie have been fooled to believe the movie is somehow deeper then it actually is. It's actually a very simple movie. When you first watch the movie you aren't sure what's going on (confusion is the intent to kind of give the viewer Leonard's perspective), you believe it's a mystery and are trying to piece things together, but in all actuality, it's not a mystery and there is nothing to really piece together, which is fine, just don't kid yourself that it's some type of mind bender that you as a viewer must figure out. Spoilers At the end of the day, Leonard is constructing these endeavors to give his life meaning...that's the big ahhah moment! So the whole time you're trying to figure out what's going on, the answer is; Leonard is just giving himself something to do. Not that big of a deal. Not a biggie, but the scene where Leonard found out that the Motel Clerk was ripping him off was kind of lame. Wouldn't that be something worth writing down, rather then chuckling about? It's kind of a big deal."
"Review of Memento : Memento, mistakenly called amnesia in Portuguese, has a script made by the director's brother, when we think it wouldn't work, but this result we have one of the most original scripts in the history of cinema and a catapulted director for the Hall of great Hollywood directors and budgets.The script tells the story of an investigation into Leonard's revenge for raping and killing his wife but the form that is told, totally backwards, it puts us perfectly like the vision of leonard who has recent memory loss , so we never know where the story is coming from and all his actions go through his notes on his photos and tattoos on his own body that puts a lot of suspense in the plot and character obsession. In addition, we have another story in parallel about an old Leonard client who has the same memory problem that goes on in black and white and this one in chronological order.With great performances we don't know who to believe in the film, exactly everyone is suspected of cheating Leonard, and even himself. But the culmination of the film is when we know that: the final scene of the film that we see the murder of a friend of the main character was not a spoiler, but when we got to the beginning of the story and she meets the parallel story in black and white and shows us that he himself killed his wife, and with the death of his wife's murderer he would never feed his ego , because he ended up doing this but did not remember, he saw that the only objective was to have life goals, to continue looking for her killer. Great!"
"Review of Memento : SPOILERS AHOY!Hehe, after seeing this film i did what everyone else did and tried and figured it all out :)But I kinda agree with what one guy said was that it isn't really meant to be figured out. You are meant to form your own conclusions, and that is exactly what the director was trying to point out, that there is no real truth, just a mixture of preceptions and memories. OK, fair enough ! SO there are alot of images thrown about to make you think one thing then another, and enough evidence given to suggest quite alot of different things. Did he kill his wife? Was Sammy a projection of himself? Did Teddy deserve to die? etc etcI'm going to close the lid on this for myself right now anyway, by saying that its just one of those things that you are not meant to figure out. You are not given enough evidence to form a conclusion, especially as alot of the film is seen through the eyes of someone with a severe mental condition and thus unreliable. In Scotland we have a verdict between guilty and not-guilty, known as 'that bastard verdict', 'Not Proven', and I'll have to leave it at that. Having read alot of Philip K Dick I do like this sort mind twister stuff, but as I said, I don't think the director wants you to be able to figure it out, so that people can have something to argue about in the pub! :P"
"Review of Memento : Memento was a much better film than anticipated from acclaimed writer/director Christopher Nolan the man behind films like The Prestige, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and last years blockbuster hit The Dark Knight which was my favorite movie of 2008. In Memento Nolan really establishes himself as an extremely talented filmmaker. Memento has an intricate but not too complicated story and the way the movie plays out with the ending in the beginning and the beginning at the end makes it feel different (in a good way) and original. Its one of those films to watch a couple times to fully understand what it was all about and so that you can pick up on little things you didn't notice the first time around. The surprises in store for anyone who hasn't seen it I wasn't quite expecting myself which made the film very enjoyable to watch at least to me. The three leads in the movie are admirable in their roles including Guy Pearce as Leonard a man with a rare brain disorder after an accident who can't form new memories. Pearce's Leonard is after the one who raped and killed his wife a man's identity he can never know for sure. Pearce is believable in the role and does a great job as the main character. Carrie Anne-Moss does a decent job as Natalie an ally to Leonard who helps in his quest to find his wife's killer but may not be who she appears. Moss is quite good at playing a character you're not sure is trying to help Leonard or just using him. The same can go for Joe Pantoliano whose equally impressive as Teddy a man Leonard isn't sure whether he can fully trust. The rest of the relatively unknown cast also turn in solid performances. The ending is fitting which reveals some secrets while keeping other questions unanswered but that doesn't hurt the movie. Overall Memento was much better than expected because of it's interesting revenge story, complex characters played by talented actors, and surprising plot twists that make for an above average entertaining thriller to watch."
"Review of Memento : This is my 1st review on the site and I have chosen this masterpiece of a movie to review.I have seen movies in my life with an innovation factor whether its the characters, the plot, the directing or even the soundtrack, but this movie deserves to be a great, clear contender in the innovation land.Since the 80s, we are tired as viewers of clichés regarding protagonists or antagonists and this movie serves the cause of surprising the viewer not necessarily plot-wise, but character-wise. I mean all of the characters in this movie have their ups and downs within the build up.Guy Pearce is certainly one of my favorite actors of all time, so it isn't new to me that I got owned by his acting and for Carrie-Anne Moss, she is an actress of natural, God-given ability. So, where did the pleasant surprise came from?... It came from Joe Pantoliano who added THE flavor to the movie.If you still haven't watched this movie and I doubt it, then go and see it today for it is a masterpiece not necessarily in its epic, rich, novely aspect, but for its innovation."
"Review of Memento : ""Memento"" is a little, minimalistic drama, artistically and technically well done film, which has received accolades from all corners well beyond both budget and hype. A ""whodunit"" of sorts with a curious premises, the film tells of an insurance investigator (Pearce) who suffers midterm memory loss and can't remember anything for more than 15 minutes. Pearce sets about find the killer of his wife, a difficult task for a normal investigator much less one with his ""condition"". The film's story is simple, the characters few, and there's no sex and little action or emoting going on. Rather the film focuses on the investigation with a clever one step forward, two steps backward flow and tortuous denouement which camouflages the many holes in the plot making for a compelling watch. Recommended for all adults into whodunits who want something to mentally chew on."
"Review of Memento : Huh? Talk about an unreliable score for a film! Unfortunately, IMDb is very, very, very skewed by recent movies. So many older great films have very few reviews or have generally lower scores--not because they are worse than newer films, but because there is a bias against older films because SOME reviewers are teens or people who simply won't consider anything that was not made in the last decade or so. Likewise, there is often a strong bias only for Hollywood blockbusters, even though many foreign or ""small"" films deserve recognition but are ignored because people just refuse to try something outside their comfort zone. This is a real shame, as there is just so much more out there. While MEMENTO is a decent and very unconventional film (I sure respect them for trying something DIFFERENT), it isn't great when viewed in context.Okay, so you may think I am just some crazy crank who is totally negative! Well, this might be true (the verdict is still out), but of the IMDb top 250, over 30% were made just in the last two decades. Also, films like THE WALLACE AND GROMIT movie, MAGNOLIA, FINDING NEVERLAND and V FOR VENDETTA make the top 250 and yet films like MARTY, THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US, SHOW PEOPLE, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, BANSHUN, THE CAINE MUTINY, CAPTAIN BLOOD, MY MOTHER'S CASTLE, CHARIOTS OF FIRE, DINNER AT EIGHT, DODSWORTH and ELMER GANTRY don't make this list (among others). It's sort of the like the expression ""out of sight, out of mind""--if a film isn't recent or make a ton of dough at the box office, it's chances of making the list are very low indeed.Okay, enough of my rant--now on to this movie. MEMENTO is a very strange movie in that the film starts at the very end and works its way backwards towards the beginning. This is an intriguing and clever idea. You know that the main character who was brain injured committed a murder, but because his injury makes it physically impossible for him to remember any events AFTER his injury, he tries to solve a mystery by leaving notes for himself and tattooing himself so he can eventually put all the pieces together. The problem is that after a while, the very stylish film becomes awfully tedious. Plus, the ending, to me, just wasn't very satisfying--it's an ending you will either love or hate. Leonard Maltin gave the film only 1 1/2 stars out of 4. I won't be THAT critical, but I just can't see how stylish film making and an odd plot result in this movie being elevated to near the top of the IMDb list of films!!NOTE TO PARENTS--the ""f-word"" is used about 200 times in the film and there is some intense violence, so this film is rated R. I watched it with my 16 year-old, but you might want to think twice about letting the kids see this one."
"Review of Memento : A man (Guy Pearce) searches for the man who raped and killed his wife.  One problem--he has no long-term memory and forgets things a few minutes after he hears them.  Another thing--the whole story is shown backwards so you have to pay strict attention to what's going on.  It's difficult (most movies don't want you to think) and exhausting but absolutely fascinating. The acting is simply superb, direction assured and the story full of unexpected twists and turns.  Also there were revelations at the end (or beginning) that totally caught me by surprise.  It's not a perfect film--I still can't figure out what Moss' character was doing in this--but how many films can you name that challenge you and don't treat you like an idiot. This will probably be a bomb (it's way too difficult for an average audience), but if you like something different and intelligent this is definetely a film to see!"
"Review of Memento : Memento is not a movie to be taken lightly. Do not get me wrong, it is definitely a good movie to watch, but it is not like many movies where you can watch it, sleep through the middle, and then wake up almost at the end and totally know what happened. These days many movies are like that, but not Memento. This is a very unique, from the way it was written, to the way it was taped, even to the way it was edited. It is a movie told backwards, in all sense of the meaning. You cannot understand the beginning without understanding the end, yet you cannot understand the end without the beginning. However, at the end of the movie, you do not go away with a feeling that something is missing, instead you get the majority of the movie, and you're are so excited to be able to say that, since most of the movie you were so confused, that you settle for the feeling that at least you got the basic idea behind the movie.I encourage everyone to see this movie with someone else, because it is definitely a movie that gets better after a good discussion. There is a lot in the movie, and since it is told backwards, it is easy to forget some things, or to forget to tie two things together. That is why the movie gets better and more interesting after discussing it with someone else, and even watching it a second or third time. The main character, Leonard has a memory disorder, and is unable to convert short term memory into long term memory. This plays out in many ways, but most importantly in the way it affects the people around him. At first one would assume that the people around him are manipulating and abusing him because of his memory problem, but in the end, which in this particular movie was the beginning, there was definitely someone alive and someone dead.Something else to think about when watching this movie is the difference between the black and white parts and the colored parts. At first it may feel that only the colored scenes are giving you the part of the story you want. However this is not true. If you watch the black and white scenes closely, you can figure out many of the secrets that make this movie to intoxicating prior to them being bluntly given away in or towards the end of the film. At first Leonard may seem like a simple guy, but you must realize he is more complex than I can explain without giving too much away. Understanding that even while he has no control over his memory, he still has a large amount of control over his life will make it a lot easier to understand. In the end, my explanation will do no justice to actually watching the movie, so I highly encourage it. But do it when there are no distractions, and perhaps when you have time to watch it a second time, even if it's not until the second day, but trust me this movie gets better the second time, and in many cases even the third time. It is well edited, and except for a few lighting problems, it is very pleasing to the eye. Over all, I think it is a top notch movie, and I do not understand why it took me so long to finally watch it!"
"Review of Memento : WOW!!Wel i have seen this film twice and the first time i watched it i thought 'very clever, but whet the hell is the truth?!'I watched it the second time VERY closely and after a while of thinking my and my friend thought we had worked it all out!But now i'm not sure, after reading some of the reviews for this i'm not sure if what I thought is really what happened, so i'm left thinking i need 2 c it again!When i first watched it i was intrigued from the word go! i couldnt stop watching it and my eyes were glued to the T.V. I couldnt wait to find out what happened next (or before depending on how u look at it!!) It is a very clever storyline and i enjoyed it but u definatly cant relax while watching it, its almost as thought u need a pad of paper to write down everything that happened! which is just what lenard needs to do with his condition, which i suppose is the whole point to the movie to make u feel like u r him!But i am still confused on to what actually happened and i would love to ask the writers, directers etc what is the truth and what is the audience meant to think!! Is there a right answer ?? I dont know, but i determind to work out the truth so i need watch it again!I think it was a brilliant film because of how it was edited and it has such an different storyline and it is very weird but interesting to watch a film 'backwards' from the truth!I'm sum what confused but it is good :)If someone knows wot the actual truth is please please write a comment on here for me 2 read so i can compare what other people think happened to what i think! thanx!Definatly worth seeing but buy the video dont rent it because you will definatly need to watch it more than once! The first time u dont have a clue, ur just thinking 'wow thats clever but i dont get it'!!SEE IT ! ITS WORTH IT !"
"Review of Memento : Except for the final couples of minutes this movie is really cool! The general idea of running the plot backwards seems totally silly at first glance. But this truly surprising film makes it. There is even an increasing tension while the movie moves towards it's plot point.This kind of storytelling is simply ingenious! But it only works once! You've seen one movie ""reversing"", and there's really no need for another one.There are even some great emotional moments, that should catapult ""Memento"" into the region of 10 or 9 stars.But they mess it up within seconds at the end. When our deranged hero tells us something about life in general and memory in special the movie breaks down. The philosophy behind these few sentences (from the off) is crude. Not at all matching the quality of the film.That costs it one star!Movie makers in general should be very careful about philosophical ideas in their movies. Especially when these ideas are expressed by their characters. They rarely reach an agreeable depth of thought!"
"Review of Memento : It is very tempting, and it is also fair, to compare Memento with Nolan's Prestige. Both require multiple viewing to fully grasp and enjoy the scenes.18 years later, Memento still puzzles. And when you finally think that you've understood it, the truth makes you shiver. Yes, this movie will make you discuss and argue its meaning.While I believe it could have been better in terms of sequencing, when I look at the progress that Mr. Nolan has made following this film, I can only applaud at his bold approach to Memento as stepping stone.
Bravo."
"Review of Memento : ""Memento"" is a Mystery - Thriller in which we watch a man trying to remember his last movements and find out the murderer of his wife. Suffering from short-term memory loss makes things very hard and he will struggle a lot to remember anything.I liked this movie very much because it had a very interesting plot consisted of many plot twists that made it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Christopher Nolan was simply amazing and he did an excellent job creating the feeling of unknown and terror to the audience. Regarding the interpretation of Guy Pearce who played as Leonard I have to admit that he was outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joe Pantoliano's who played as Teddy and Carrie-Anne Moss' who played as Natalie. Lastly, I have to say that ""Memento"" is an interesting movie and I recommend everyone to watch it but I suggest you to follow the plot very carefully otherwise you will be completely lost and you won't understad anything."
"Review of Memento : Tightly acted and directed, and brilliantly adapted from a short story that used an unusual idea for a mystery thriller: supposing the central figure can only remember things that happened a long time ago or within the last 15 minutes? The psychological condition where someone, after a trauma, cannot create new memories, is vividly recreated as we are introduced to 15 minute segments one at a time, in reverse chronological order.
To pull this off and maintain smooth continuity is quite a feat, which is why this movie is such a remarkable accomplishment. We are as bewildered as Leonard (played by Guy Pearce) as he searches for the man who brutally raped and killed his wife. He leaves himself clues in the form of tattooed notes and Polaroid pictures to substitute for memory.The tension towards the climax and gut-wrenching revelations reminded me of the Usual Suspects as I came out of the cinema dazzled by the inventiveness and mental pace which this film achieves."
"Review of Memento : Memento is one of the most intriguing films I've seen in recent years, but it hardly deserves the current ranking it has in the top 250 films of all time.We begin the film with the murder of the man whom our hero believes raped and killed his wife, and move backwards throughout the entire plot. Each segment moves forward narratively, but comes after the scene which follows it. Meanwhile, in black and white, we follow a short space of time somewhere in past in which Leonard talks about his life as an insurance investigator before his wife's murder.The main character suffers from a brain injury, acquired at the time of his wife's murder, which has destroyed his short-term memory. He can't remember what has just happened to him, but remembers everything up to the ""incident"" - his name, his wife, his job. He deals with life in 15-minute snatches, as if he was continually waking up in a strange room. In one especially clever sequence, he is running through a trailer park with the thought, ""Okay, what am I doing? Ah. I'm chasing this guy. Wait. He's chasing me!"". He tattoos his body with important information relating to his pursuit of the man who killed his wife and destroyed his memory. He writes copious notes and takes Polaroids of people and writes crucial information about them on the back.All this is simply a device, a device which sometimes transcends the relatively standard plot which accompanies it, but not always. It does make the film worth watching. One of the hallmarks of a great director is being able to take a familiar story and tell it in a way that suprises us. It succeeds. The backwards storytelling puts us in the same predicament as Leonard; we don't know what just happened before this scene. We're confused, working off what he's written on pieces of paper and Polaroid photographs, with no knowledge of what has happened before (which will be displayed to us subsequently).Good system. The story, unfortunately, isn't entirely worthy of such a cool storytelling method, but it's still quite good, despite falling into some film noir cliches.The directing is crisp and the innovative editing style is enjoyable. The score is unnotable. The acting from all four of the major roles is outstanding. Leonard's character is incredibly sympathetic, which is crucial to such a film, although nobody is who we think they are by the time we've rewound through time far enough to understand what has come before (after).The DVD features an ability to watch the story in forward rather than reverse order, a perspective on the film I'm very much looking forward to experiencing.Totally worth watching, but don't expect the greatest film you've ever seen, despite the state of the votes at the moment (11th of all time). My rating: 8/10."
"Review of Memento : **possible spoilers**This movie is about reality,  memory, cruelty, tattoos, damage, time, dangling clues, making  sense of it all, and taking useful notes. It's about the ungraceful way so many lives unravel past points of no return.
Things happen as we age. We crumble a bit at the edges, and sometimes we break off in huge chunks beyond repair. This is the story of a real broken cookie named Lenny Shelby.Lenny doesn't look broken. He's got the pretty face, nice car, fancy suit. but it is hard to fathom how he is not dead or institutionalized, poor chap.
I watched this film twice. It's twice as cruel the second time. Though the spit is hard to swallow, this is a kick-ass film. It got me thinking from so many angles. Why didn't Lenny put dates and times on his notes? IMDB users rank it #10 in the top 250. Part of that high rank is that this is a secret tattoo cult film, like Cape Fear. Ball point pen ink and a hot needle {{ shivers! }} ."
"Review of Memento : Who is the villain? Who is a friend? What will happen next? What did just happen a while ago? Many questions in a movie that unlike any other really explores the memory of a man who is lacking it. He wants to find the person who murdered his wife but with a memory that lasts no more than fifteen minutes it's a hard work.Excellent dialogues, good actors and the constant mind-bonglingly sense that no one seems to be what he or she claims to be makes this a real winner. Rent it, buy it, own it and go on a exploration into an absent mind. You won't regret it. Your memory is a terrible thing to waste."
"Review of Memento : Memento is a thought-provoking and potentially uncomfortable discovery into people through the main character Leonard.SideNote: The biggest complaint my friends had about the film is that they couldn't grasp the multitude of time shifts that occur in the movie. These are key to understanding the plot and the motivations and mind-set of Leonard. I didn't have any difficulty in this area, perhaps because I am described as observant and attentive. By the time the third shift happened, I was ready for it, and by the end of the movie, was relishing each shift. In case its not obvious, if you can't handle these shifts, you will not do well in understanding the movie. :End SideNoteLeonard can't fix his life. He asserts that he is seeking revenge for his wife's murder, but that is a smokescreen to him dealing with the person he's become, and the life he's living. He can't let go of the notion that his wife is just around the corner, 'just gone to the bathroom'. This haunts him. If he could just wake up one day knowing that his wife was gone, he could let go. He destroys evidence and kills people, but when he wakes up, his purpose in life will still be to find John G., as tatooed on his body.The uncomfortable truth uncovered through Leonard is the limitations, frailties, and desperation we all contain. Leonard's memory problem sets the backdrop, and his dealing with it is where you will start questioning things. While you can mentally seperate yourself from the character in the beginning because you don't share his particular ailment, in relection you will see the connections to all people.My reaction to Leonard's character changed with my changing perception of his motivations, as well as how conscious he was of his actions. Victim? Murderer? Confused and desperate? Its all there.I enjoyed Memento, and I intend to watch this movie again. There are many levels here, and I want to pick up on more. I saw the DVD on the small screen. Included is an interview with the director, which carried some interest. Unfortunately, the interviewer didn't seem to fully understand the movie, which weakened it somewhat."
"Review of Memento : Enough reasonable (and a few truly dismal) reviews of Mememto already exist on the IMDB, so I can only add my vote that Memento is a film worth seeing. Whether or not it deserves to be called one the ""greatest films of all time"" is irrelevant, since that is a subjective honor anyway. It's high ranking is almost certainly due to a rapid flood of votes following its recent release (I mean, come on--Lord of the Rings ranks even higher than Casablanca, Star Wars and Citizen Kane!). The point is that, objectively speaking, Memento is a truly original, unique, and well made film, and there is some truly fascinating and thoughtful dialogue and narrative here. For that reason alone any film lover should check it out.I must add, however, that the DVD features an Independent Film Channel interview with Writer/Director Christopher Nolan that is one of the most visually irritating pieces I have ever seen. The interview randomly skips frames, causing subtle but silly jumps that remind me of the lousy black & white film the castaways on Gilligan's Island once made (""I'd walk out on that picture even on an airplane!""). Presumably, someone thought this was an artistic touch, but the end result is that it just looks dumb, and I had to *turn the video off on a DVD* in order to enjoy or get anything positive out of the interview! That's quite a blunder considering how worthy the film itself is."
"Review of Memento : This one is probably the greatest script of all times: a feast for the brain, a mind-teasing exercise in madness, that starts with a bang and develops in a movie that you have to see several times to fully appreciate. SPOILER ALERT... The story is great, logical, perfect in its development, with the start that is the end and the end that could be a new start... And there also a key to the understanding of the movie: the principal character is really without short term memory or he is faking this disturb? The answer, at least for me, lay in his key-chain alarm. Watch for is use during the movie and you will have a clear answer. But my answer could be different from yours. And in this, mostly, lay the force of this movie. Remember...."
"Review of Memento : Man, this movie blew me away.  They took a totally new approach to storytelling here.  Straight through, then backwards from the end, while showing present time as the story progresses. This is one of those movies that you'll have to watch numerous times to make all of the connections. The cinematography simulates Leonard's short memory loss, it seems, as you are thrusted form scene to scene, mostly out of sequence.  The story is compelling and it keeps you guessing throughout the whole movie. Excellent!!"
"Review of Memento : What else can I say about MEMENTO that hasn't already been said? It's wildly original, endlessly brilliant, unforgettable in all senses. I wonder how it didn't win Best Original Screenplay in 2002- Academy voters gave the award to GOSFORD PARK, a film I also loved, but you can't ignore a screenplay like that of MEMENTO, one that restores your faith in screenwriters.10/10- the second best film of 2001... losing only to MULHOLLAND DRIVE"
"Review of Memento : Memento is a one of a kind film that to me felt like it didn't quite live up to the hype and reviews. The cinematography itself was superior and the way it filmed was extremely unique and had never been done before which I appreciate. But for how unique and different it was, it was equally confusing and just all over the place. I felt the movie lost your attention and just lacked an overall synergy. The story line was cool and there was a lot of mind bending moments that made you think but I just think this movie could've been redone and been better than it ended up being. Worth the watch regardless still."
"Review of Memento : ""Memento"" is a sleaze-ball suspense movie with a twist. As if you don't know it yet, the scenes are played all jumbled and out of order.What could have turned into just a nasty trick on the viewer is actually very well-done here. You see things from the perspective of our main character who suffers from a bizarre memory loss condition. Rather than explain the plot, I will just say that if you plan on watching this movie just once, get ready to change your plans. You will need to watch it twice to fully GET it. It moves too fast for the viewer and by the time it's over you will tell yourself that you GET it, but you don't.To those who say there are no holes in this film I scoff at you. Why does Leonard have no memory loss in the murder sequence? He remembers long enough to drive all the way to that abandoned building and then wait for the murderer. In other scenes, he forgets what he is doing after two minutes. Maybe he is just psychotic and made the whole condition up in his mind to excuse a rampage? The hypotheses are endless. Personally, I'd rather watch a movie that just makes sense on it's own and no matter what you say, this one doesn't. ""Memento"" tries to do what ""Pulp Fiction"" did but takes itself way too seriously. The viewers are treated to a narrative from the character Teddy at the end when he has to explain the situation to Leonard thus explaining the movie to us. Kind of cheap, Nolan.One thing is for sure: Guy Pearce is one of the best actors alive.7 out of 10, kids."
"Review of Memento : The majority of people on this comments board attribute this film's success to its very original editing style. The film is built upon this style, showing you a present-time snippet of the main character which leaves you wondering about why he got there and what he's doing. The film then continues showing you a snippet of the immediate preceding past of the main character, and so on backwards in time helping you understand the beginning of the film. That's where the movie's originality stops. The plot itself is filled with huge holes. While the premise is interesting, it is hardly plausible that someone with no short-term memory would not be 'assisted' by society in any way, nor that he could not have a notebook handcuffed to him or something rather than all the tattoos. I found the movie rather predictable and did not really care about the movie after about halfway through.Still, an interesting and innovative movie-making style with a neat, if unplausible, situation for the main character. This coupled with sometimes very unconvincing acting by the main actor (although it is a hard role, he never really pulls it off) and a wholly boring plot earns this movie a 7 in my book.If you want to see a real whodunnit type movie that will haunt you for a long time to come, try Thesis by Spanish director Almenabar which I saw last night and save Memento for a day you want to study film rather than enjoy it."
"Review of Memento : I like to start my review by saying that I don't think this is an enjoyable movie which doesn't mean it is at all bad, I thought it was very good actually. The story is what stands out, it's very unique and the way it is presented is great although it is rather slow throughout. For me it was a bit boring as it was straight dialogue for two hours, but it did all lead to a dramatic ending which was quite satisfying yet a bit confusing. Most Christopher Nolan movies are quite confusing though so I did expect this when coming into it and I did understand what happened I don't feel like I was truly able to take in so much knowledge in at once and it left me a bit baffled. The acting was pretty good, nothing stood out to me neither did the music used and it wasn't that tense but the idea as a whole was great and that is pretty much the only reason I give this higher than a five, the story. I wish it were showed in a different way or just readjusted to better suit the high percentage of slightly idiotic people watching the movie, which I feel like I fall under that category after watching this. I give this seven for it's cleverness alone."
"Review of Memento : I went into this movie with high expectations and found it to be good, but by no means great. I think that this movie would have been better if it were shorter, about 50 minutes. Within 30 minutes I had figured pretty much everything about the movie, who's bad who's good, what's happening now and what's gonna happen next, predictable. In fact I was bored for the rest of the movie, it was not suspenseful and not thrilling. The good things that this movie did have going for it was excellent directing and a slightly confusing turn of events from one scene to the next, but again after the first 30 minutes it became very predictable. It was pretty unique, though i have seen a few movies that begin with the end first and work backwards. This is also done in Seinfeld, in the episode titled ""The Betrayal,"" which came out two years before. Overall, it is a movie worth seeing, though it is highly overrated."
"Review of Memento : Christopher Nolan directs this truly original, mesmerizing, though puzzling film featuring Guy Pearce as a man suffering from amnesia, who, along with assistance from co-stars Joey Pantoliano & Carrie Ann Moss, try to unravel his identity, and the events that led up to his amnesia, though they may wish they hadn't...I couldn't give away the secret even if I wanted too, since the film is densely plotted, being revealed layer by layer, with the events told and retold so frequently, that it may be hard to figure it out after only one viewing, so multiple viewings are a must, even though one can take only so much of it at a time! Nonetheless, a most intriguing and fascinating experiment, worthy of Alfred Hitchcock!"
"Review of Memento : This is just...I don't even know. I watched this years ago and was really blown away by its odd structure, but really it's rather simple once you get a grip on it - heinously simple, even. It's told backwards in a linear line and interspersed with black and white shots of the lead actor telling us the back story, so what? This movie is given a lot of credit for being complex, but it's not that mind boggling when you think about it. And the ending just feels like a huge slap in the face, especially after all that build up and guessing...it's deceitful! And a lot of the first half of this is just too dull at times - especially the bits where the lead character is telling you about his client in the past who had a similar condition. It just feels too forced; they could have done it in a better and more interesting way. But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a good movie anyway. The deceit of the ending has its purpose and everything is fulfilled in the end; I just can't help feeling a little odd about it anyway. The strength of this movie just lies in the suspense that comes with it. Deceitful or not, it keeps you watching and guessing until the end. Sigh, this is a really dividing movie, as you can tell. You just don't know what to think about it, and I guess that's another good thing about it. Memento is a perplexing case and I would recommend it if you like thrillers - although you could always do better, this one definitely stands out."
"Review of Memento : Leonard Shelby, who suffers from short-term memory loss, attempts to find the identity of the surviving thug who raped and murdered his wife (Jorja Fox) by retaining Polaroid photos and notes that are stuffed into his pockets, and by tattooing essential clues on his body. Although he was able to shoot and kill one of his wife's two assailants, the second villain caused him a serious blow to the head, damaging his brain. The police do not believe in a second attacker. As Leonard remembers the past before his wife's murders, he has anterograde, and not retrograde amnesia, and knows how to read, to drive, get gas, handle personal affairs, etc. If Leonard's conversations exceed 5 minutes or so, he will forget what the subject was to begin with. His personal struggles are obviously great. When he awakens, he has to determine where he is and how he got there. When a man chases him, he is at first confused and thinks he is chasing the man and wondering why. He knows the truth when the other man fires a gun at him.To tell the tale, Director Christopher Nolan demonstrates an unusual take: there are two alternate timelines. They comprise a black and white part told chronologically and the color sequence division that is told in reverse (non-linear). They merge in the middle of the film although the black and white scenes continue to nearly the end. Each scene is divided into 5-10 minute segments.The film begins in color with the murder of major character John Edward ""Teddy"" Gammell (Joe Pantoliano) and works backwards to show the events leading up to it. Leonard, in his own mind, believes that Teddy was one of two assailants that killed his wife. But Leonard is looking at the picture from his own (flawed) perspective. Teddy may be a corrupt undercover cop who takes drug money to enrich himself, and even uses Leonard for his own purposes, but he is no murderer or rapist. And the way the film is constructed, we probably have to believe Teddy's comments because there is no other explanation from the director. Nevertheless, Leonard wrote ""Don't believe his lies,"" under Teddy's photograph, and Teddy was doomed.Then there is the woman, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Morse), who also has her own agenda and definitely uses Leonard. Her boyfriend is drug dealer Jimmy Grantz (Larry Holden). Near the end of the movie, in the last black and white segment, Leonard murders (again) Jimmy because he thought that he was the man who supposedly killed his wife. During the confrontation, Leonard receives those two annoying scratches seen throughout much of the film. After that Teddy warned him to leave town, discard Jimmy's expensive suit, and drive his jaguar because he would be a sitting duck for dealers looking for him. Leonard ignores Teddy.The black and white chronological portion explains Leonard's life as an insurance claims investigator. He has authority to handle the case of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who has claimed short-term memory loss as a result of an automobile accident. After many tests Leonard concludes that Sammy's problem is mental, not physical from the accident, and advises his company to deny the claim. Later to test her husband, his diabetic wife subjects herself to a fatal test. Nevertheless, near the end of the film in a color sequence, Teddy explains to Leonard that Sammy was faking and never had a wife, and that it was Leonard's spouse who was a diabetic. Furthermore Teddy explains that it was he as a cop who was assigned to Leonard's wife's case. The two of them tracked down the thug and killed him. Also, he states that his wife survived the assault, and that Leonard invented Sammy's story as his own! Did Leonard forget to give his wife an insulin injection? Or did he give her too many? Assuming Teddy was telling the truth, why doesn't Leonard remember that his wife was a diabetic? Note that there is a color scene where Leonard lies in bed with his wife. He does appear to give her an injection in her right thigh, and right after pinches it. And near the very end we see tattoos are already on his body with his wife alive. She must have survived the assault.The film ending is in color and shows Leonard driving up to Emma's Tattoo parlor. Guess what he will have tattooed on his body this time!?The acting is top-notch throughout, as is the editing and pacing. The storyline is unique, to say the least, in the way the timelines are presented. Viewers have to pay close attention and trust their own memories when watching this one! I believe that there is a plot hole. Near the very end we see tattoos on Leonard's body with his wife alive. On the left side of his chest, a tattoo reads, ""I've done it."" (So he killed the thug who assaulted his wife.) But why is the particular tattoo missing throughout the movie? Anyway, Joe Pantoliano steals every scene where he appears. By the way, the movie doesn't say, but if this writer were a betting man he would say that Joe Pantoliano's character is called Teddy because of his strong resemblance to Teddy Roosevelt when he was a Rough Rider. Check out his old photos circa 1898."
"Review of Memento : I have to say, this film was very interesting to see. It had a really interesting concept and it was great to watch. I did not however enjoy it as much as what I see others have, from seeing other reviews. It's not that I don't understand the plot or something, I just didn't find it as gripping as others make it out to be. Besides that it still was a very solid film that I recommend."
"Review of Memento : Very mysterious, but I was too confused by the timeline and the editing. Didn't quite enjoy it. May be suffering from unrealistic expectations due to the film's cult classic status. Very mysterious, but I was too confused by the timeline and the editing. Didn't quite enjoy it.

Review of Memento : Great the first time but there are inconsistancies noticable after a couple of vewings. But the premice of the movie is great. The backwords time thing makes it difficult to notice inconsistancies. Also Guy Pierce's memory isn't quite eraced in some of the scenes.
"Review of Memento : This movie is great not because of wonderful stories but how they are told. I could not figure out what this movie is trying to say for the first time I watched it. However, I knew these stories were narrated from the end for the second time and could narrowly understand the whole structure. After watching many masterpieces of Christopher Nolan, I gradually developed a particular sense to know how the plots would go on because his technique is basically playing with clips. This movie tells a very simple story that the leading role's wife was 'murdered' somehow, and he tried his best to find and kill the 'murderer'. Monochrome scenes were narrated from the beginning while colorized ones from the end. Only at last could we know that it had always been him that created puzzles and solved them himself."
"Review of Memento : First and foremost I'd say to anyone going into this film blind, do not come in thinking you're in for simple linear narrative with a clear start and end point; it's one of those films that can will never be easily explained, the narrative is just that complex.The film follows a man named Leonard or ""Lenny"" with after an accident now lives with extremely short term memory. This characteristic is the very foundation of the film because we as the audience follow Lenny from start to finish, we know everything he knows, we learn everything he learns. However just as we learn everything Lenny does, Lenny is unable to remember the new information which adds good layer of intrigue and mystery as to how the film will end.The narrative as I've mentioned before is non-linear, the events as we see them are not chronological for the most part. The only scenes that actually run in chronological order are the series of black and white scenes that incorporate flashbacks providing additional plot points. The scenes in colour play backward in contrast to the black and white scenes in what Christopher Nolan (the director) describes as a hairpin narrative where the narrative loops on itself and the true end point lies around the middle of the story.As my summary suggests Memento had me confused for the large majority of the run time, what with the unconventional narrative structure and the slight frustration I felt as Lenny's memory issues proved to be his greatest weakness amidst everything and everyone around him. However the overall mystery of the film kept me engaged from start to finish, although the conclusion may leave some (as it did with me) with an anti-climactic feeling due to how Memento resolves its plot threads. Despite this Memento is still gripping from start to end and I'd highly recommend checking it out, especially for those interested in more unconventional and experimental storytelling."
"Review of Memento : This is my first review here. I just watched Memento last night and was looking at other reviews. I might not have wrote my own but there are way to many people just over rating this movie. Yes was a it good to watch yea. Unique sort of. I know this film was made a while back but the backward story telling or puzzle story telling has been done before. Many have sighted Pulp Fiction. This is just a story telling tool and whether it has been done before or not is not the point. Was it done well. Yes. It also suited the getting into the POV of the main characters head. For this the movie was very well done.As far as acting it is hard to grade for me. Short scenes leave little chance to truly show off what talent may or may not be there. Over all you do get a sense of the chars but its really just a superficial view of them. I think this was done on purpose by the film maker to hide what comes next. Did the actors fit their roles yes but they fit their roles for the moment. The moment of each scene. You see what they are like in that moment in time before who they really are is revealed. This works for the first half the movie and once you figure out things they seem more like actors just saying lines. The true trick or gimmick is not the backward story telling but the fact that every scene... wait spoiler... is built upon illusions and lies. From the very first scenes on is all a series of lies and illusions. This is what actually is very well done and different, because even in lies there is truth. However by the time you get half way through the movie you already figured out where these lies will lead and how they lead back to the first scene. To me there was no major plot twist it was just now following the trail to see how it plays out. This to me is were the film begins to lag and no longer holds any suspense. Two thoughts on this. One is that really in the end the actual story was a weak plot. There was nothing to the story but questions. This could be what the film maker wanted. What is real what is not. Who is not telling the truth who is. Or maybe they are all telling a bit of the truth. Maybe its Leonard who is not facing the truth. That the truth is to hard to face so he creates his own. Or that the world is nothing but the lies which we want to believe. Maybe a mix of it all. OK so it makes you think but I was thinking this half way through the movie. We do get hints that maybe the Leonard and Sammy are one but nothings really answered. Leonard manipulates his world by what he wants to believe by writing it down. Others manipulate him into believing things are not what they seem.It is the ending which I believe is the let down. We are filled with not only the suppose twist with Teddy and what he tells Leonard but we are left with who is telling the truth. All we are left with is that Leonard actually doesn't want to know the truth. This leaves the viewer sitting through 2 hours of film that from the very start the main char is seeking the truth that he never really wants to know in the end. He killed the only one who perhaps knew the truth at the start of the movie. How ironic.One more note. My opinion is the black and white scenes are Leonard's lies he is creating to hide what happened and the color scenes are the lies or half truths the world is showing him. Otherwise he remembers his lies or what he wants to and the color scenes is what the world unveils to him. He reconstructs his world with what he writes down. Unique, different but I would not say brilliant. Good beginning but fades and becomes predictable in the end. You realize the question the film maker is asking and that he isn't going to tell you half way through the film. Writing for first half 10 second half 6. Plot 7. Did it keep me on the edge. 5 Overall I give it a 7 because I liked it. Its is a movie you have to see once just not the type I would see again. To me that is what makes a movie great is wanting to see it again."
"Review of Memento : This movie is like a beautiful person, who everyone agrees is beautiful, but only some would date. It is a matter of taste. I loved the action, mystery, and drama in this film. I loved the original plot and phenomenal acting. But I don't like movies that lack a protagonist. I don't like movies about bad people doing bad things for the rest of their lives. I like to see at least one good person, who does the right thing, and achieves justice in some form at the end. What ever happened to the universal theme of good vs. evil? Do Americans just want to see evil? Is there an evil trend going on that I wasn't informed of? This movie would have gotten a 10 if it had a happy ending, or even a happy anything. Movies that start and end with wickedness are not my thing."
"Review of Memento : I like the way it is filmed, quite new at the time.I like the concept but it is used too much, too much exploited. We see the same scenes again and again. It is a good thriller though, we have a different portrait of the character since we go backwards. The actors Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano do a great performance.Most of my friends really enjoyed the movie, so did I. We try to figure out the movie during the whole time, thanks to the concept. It makes us think and the story is not predictable, which is nice. Of course it can be confusing, and some people don't like these kind of movies. For me the ambiguity is what makes the film great."
"Review of Memento : Memento concerns Leonard Shelby, (a great performance by Guy Pearce) a man who suffers from short term memory loss. This leaves him unable to form new memories. Director Christopher Nolan puts us inside the mind of Leonard by giving the film a non-linear structure. This brilliant choice is at times a double edged sword. The non- linear time-line makes the viewer as clueless as Leonard Shelby. We don't know what has happened, when it happened, etc. I give Nolan chops for making that choice. I think it gives Memento its unique quality. On the other hand, the jumping back and forth does not allow Leonard Shelby to develop as a character. As I think more about this, it is actually brilliant. As a character who cannot form new memories, there is no reason for Leonard to have a character arc. The audience member is deprived of the same things as Leonard: closure, understanding, relief. This is definitely a film to see more than once. I bet that I will appreciate it more after viewing it another time. Meanwhile, watch, enjoy, and go along for the ride. Let Christopher Nolan play with your mind like silly putty."
Review of Memento : Memento was a very good film about a man called Lenny with anterograde amnesia and in order to progress with his journey he takes photographs and write on them to remember. The storyline uses a technique called fabula and ceujet which is Russian and means the story line from the black and white to the colour crosses over after building from different points.
"Review of Memento : The ending starts at the begging, the sequaence is going backwards to the start of the plot. Now, in 2021 we have seen many directors make similar attempts, however must have been the most unique script of the early 2000s.However, once you realise certain facts about the storyline, it get's annoyingly repetitive. Felt like I was waiting it to end at some point. The opposite of actively piecing the puzzle together, which was the entire point of the jumbled sequencing.It's definetely out of the oridinary and will get you thinking but the payoff right at the end was not exactly gratifying. Don't regret I watched it, since it is first of it's kind and is a piece of movie history in my book."
Review of Memento : The idea is cool and is a good thriller. But its too much confusing and strange to me. The mix the point of view too much. But the movie overall good. If thinj you need to watch it at least 2 times to get bettey point of view. But i am not kind of this people who watch second time in a row.
"Review of Memento : Don't be fooled.  This is certainly a good film but I strongly believe it has been consistently overrated by most voters.  Its originality - and it's original like hell - has surely generated more enthusiasm among voters than it should have.  When you come to a cold analysis, however, it's definitely not a better film than American Beauty, Vertigo, The Seven Year Itch, Cat on Hot Tin Roof, East of Eden, Mighty Aphrodite, Requiem for a Dream, Chinatown and The Green Mile, to name just a few among a hundred.  Relax, forget the 8.7/10 rating, and enjoy its mind twisting puzzle."
"Review of Memento : I really love when the movie makers tried to surprise me. Tried to make me spend two hours of my life with good entertainment mixed with a more elaborated history then the Hollywood usual. And even more, i really love when them shows me that a history who not seems to have so much potential at the beginning and accomplished a whole different dimension if showed from another perspective. Memento it's a movie that can full almost completely this description, but if not do so, it's because we can saw in this movie what happened when you have a thousand of ideas, a strong will of executed them, but failed in what matters the most: makes those who watched the movie believe in that history as them believe in their owns. And this can be verified after the half of the movie, when the history, exciting and fresh until that moment, turn to a extreme confuse narrative, dialogs in the limit of the good sense, with characters taking the most strangers decisions in pro of the most complicated and untouchable final a as possible as can be. A common addiction in the post-Tarantino age. And i just can't agree with that."
"Review of Memento : Like Bladerunner's director's cut, this movie could really win from losing about half of the voice-overs. Sure enough, most of these are an attempt to drive home the role of ""routine & discipline"" in the main character's life, but so much info through the guy's eyes makes the second half of the movie relatively predictable. I am not saying this is a bad movie, on the contrary, but 49% of you voting 10/10 is ridiculous."
"Review of Memento : Memento will grab your attention from the first scene, let you relax a little in the middle and finally feel in disbelieve and some what empty at the end. The plot is actually quite simple and ordinary if it is told in the normal fashion - chronological order. However, because it is told in reverse, the film sort of rewards you as you figure out how this scene has affected the previous scenes. You will be guessing each characters true intentions and motives.Yes, memory is not reliable, and yes people still believe what they want to believe. It's good but I don't think it can stand repeat viewings. A Cool 7/10"
"Review of Memento : This movie is mind-blowing. I have seen it at least 20 times and cannot get sick of it. Guy Pearce rocks and kind of has a Brad Pitt quality about him in this movie. I really hope that movies like this become a standard. I am really getting tired of hearing people say that they really think Cast Away was a good movie or that titanic was even decent. movies like that make me sick, there is no thought put into them and a five year old could have written better dialogue. It's sad to know that those types of movies are 30 times more lucrative then works of art like memento are. Memento is the most original, well-written, well-directed,and well-acted movie i have ever seen. This is definitely my favorite movie of all time and i'm sure that after you see it you will feel exactly the same."
"Review of Memento : This was ""okay,"" but frankly overrated by the national critics. Because the story ran backwards, I guess that was supposed to be cool or hip or something. If you make things too hard on the audience and most get confused on what's happening, it makes the elitist critics feel good because they ""understand it"" and thus feel superior. It's so much hogwash.Having said, I didn't say I didn't find the movie interesting. I did, and enjoyed the performances of Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss. A man with no short- term memory goes back, scene-by-scene, trying to find the killer of his wife. It's a film I saw back in 2001 on VHS and I'd like to see it again, now that six years have passed since then. I understand one of the special-edition DVDs of this showed the movie in the correct time sequence without all the flashbacks. That might have been less-creative, but better.However, be warned: this is a frustrating film to watch for first-time viewers."
"Review of Memento : Watching this until the end and back a few minutes of the beginning is, TOTAL IRRITATION.The ONLY unique element of this movie is that scenes are played backwards and every time the man reads the note taken in previous scenes so that you can understand the confusion of someone with short term memory loss. A secondary element is that, similar to the case in Shutter Island, this man's hallucinations forged his memory into distortion so that later on he realized that even the name imprinted on his body wasn't fact but invented by himself.The main character was supposed to be a 'disciplined and organized' person, or in short, highly logical being. But he turned out to be a stupid and conceited retard.Yes, it particularly amazed me that every word thrown at him by Natalie (played by Moss) when she tricked him into her puppet and changed the course of his revenge fits him perfectly - a freaky venereal disease-ridden retard who did a pretty poor job in taking notes, which is the very central element in this movie."
"Review of Memento : It's very complex and complicated. The whole film consists of flashbacks, which is very hard to watch. But you're solving the puzzle. At the end there are still pieces of the puzzle lacking.
It's a very complex story. Too many flashbacks. There is no red thread."
"Review of Memento : Perhaps because this movie was rated SO HIGHLY, my viewing was tainted by unrealistically bolstered expectations. Maybe...There was a strange twist of irony at work here: the more I watched this film the less I liked it. What began as a wonderfully, refreshing look at (reverse) story-telling, became less entertaining and more tedious with each passing (and re-passing) flash-back (or is that flash-forward?)Part of this film played like an old Twilight Zone episode I recall seeing many years ago. And that's not a bad thing. I enjoyed piecing together the ""why"" of the plot, since we already knew the ""what."" However, generally uninteresting and unappealing characters mar the performances, and while our hero may be unaware of time, as a viewer I was painfully aware of how his film seemed to drag, lacking a good sense of timing. As for the ending, it too could have been given the same delicious touches as the beginning sequence, but alas, it does nothing to reward the viewer for having endured the bulk of the film.One reviewer commented how well this HIGHLY RATED film will hold up in another few years when compared to the classics. Others have asked how on earth it could have rated so high to begin with. The former will be answered on its own, and I believe time will not be too kind. The answer to the latter is akin to the McDonald's Syndrome: Those who grew up eating Big Macs on a regular basis erroneously come to believe it's actually good food. Perhaps compared to what Hollywood is offering these days, Memento is indeed gourmet fare. To me, it's still just a hamburger. (6 out of 10)."
"Review of Memento : There are holes in the plot of this movie that should prevent it from receiving the ranking it has in this database (1 of the top 10 all time best movies). In the end, the characters are not sympathetic or interesting enough to warrant the treatment they get in the film. I do not think this is a must see movie for anyone."
"Review of Memento : * Spoilers * I've seen many positive comments about this movie from people who were happy they ""got it"". For me the film didn't tell anything new. Basically we live in the world we want to live in. Welcome to life. I didn't have any sympathy for the guy from the start. Anyone who thinks revenge, and especially murder solves anything deserve what they get. And Nolan made it obvious that Lenny made mistakes - not being consistent, not writing down stuff - this told me he wasn't a hero searching for the truth but someone running from it.The interesting part is how captivating the description of this guy's condition is. Nolan could really make it believable and had me scribbling stuff on paper just for fun after the film.So apart from some starting boring moments, an entertaining film, but it doesn't deserve 14000 10 votes from people who have just discovered that there are movies other than the action flick of the week.6/10"
"Review of Memento : You know that IMDb Top 250 is always discussed, the overrated movies, the underrated movies, the movies which should be in the list, the movies which should not be in the list etc. I believe that movies like Memento causes a problem. The ratings of some other movies lose their meaning. They cause some other movies lose their worth. Memento has one of the most smart, brilliant and complicated scripts of all time and also the story editing of the film is the same, it must be very hard to make, as known, the story begins from the end and retrogresses, in terms of direction, it is well, but no more than that, so a good movie, a good crime thriller. The tone of the movie is 'independentish'. I don't say this in a good way or in a bad way, but it just looked me interesting. Even if I could not understand it exactly, there is also a twist at the end. I recently saw The Machinist which I can call Christian Bale's Memento, it was a pretty good movie, but there were plot holes, but there is not in Memento, so I appreciate the effort, but it is neither one of my favorite movies nor a great movie. If its rating had been 7.7 or let's say 8.0, it would have been welcome. Probably it is because the script was brilliant, I agree, but as a movie, generally 8.6 is extremely over."
"Review of Memento : At the end of the movie Shelby explains everything about what really happened to the person Leonard was looking for. my question is where is that ""I've done it"" tattoo through out the movie. A scene shows Leonard's wife rubbing his ""I've done it"" tattoo but where is it when Natalie and Leonard look at the mirror when they are reading Leonard's backwards tattoo. Its a good movie but it fell apart for me when i figured out the hole. Because if Leonard would of saw his ""I've done it"" tattoo at the start of the movie, he would need no reason to find that burglar because he would seen on his chest that he has killed him! Still a good movie though.I'm just guessing here but maybe this is why the academy awards didn't nominate memento for best picture because they probably figured out the hole too."
"Review of Memento : Rating: 6.9A creative thought experiment of a movie about how your perception of reality can create your reality. The structure of the film was unique as it really put you in the shoes of the protagonist who had short-term memory issues as it was basically told in reverse. The twist of the ending where we learn Lenny was actually Sammy and he was the one who sent himself on a quest to kill Teddy was insane (though I doesn't make sense how Lenny knew about his wife's experiments because his memory issues started after the assault which was before his wife's OD.). It always kept you questioning the veracity of what's being presented because we're dealing with the unreliable narrator trope. However, the engagement value of this movie was low as the novelty of the reverse storytelling wore off by ACT II, leaving you just wanting all the pieces to be explained. This is a movie that almost requires a rewatch to fully grasp so I may be editing this review in the future. Overall a ""ok"" film though not the most entertaining."
"Review of Memento : OK, granted this movie has a unique premise. This movie is quite entertaining and will keep ya watching. But this movie is not the amazing work of art many would have you believe. It is a decent thriller with a twist in that it works backwards and puts the watcher into the same mindset of our main character who has reoccuring amnesia. Decent movie that changes the viewers opinion throughout the flick as our character slowly works his way through time in reverse. We see things happen and then we slowly find out how those things came to be as we move farther back.***********Spoiler****************One major fault in the movie. The scene where our main character is manipulated by the lady to deal with her boyfriend is completely screwy. They tried to make it out that she totally planned it and covered all the bases but if one watches that scene one can see that one million things could have gone wrong and even should have when she plays her game and gets hit. Hiding of the pens, the seriously fast relapse of the main character (and her not knowing at that point how fast a lapse takes), and other problems just bugged me with that one scene. It was the most far fetched part of the entire movie and should have been done differently."
"Review of Memento : End the from begins that thriller dark a. If you have problems with understanding the previous sentence, you are going to have even more trouble with understanding the film. Its basic idea is turning the action around. Not in a mechanical way, fortunately. ""Memento"" is a pack of scenes that end in the moment the previous scenes started in.The main character is an ex-detective from an insurance company (Guy Pearce). His wife, as everything seems so, has been brutally raped and murdered while he himself was hit in his head. The effect of damage is the so-called short memory loss. Our hero remembers exactly who he was before that tragical incident, but he doesn't remember who he talked to and what about five minutes ago. That is why he has to write everything down. He collects Polaroid pictures of the people he meets. He fills his pockets with some quick notes. He even treats his own body as a big organizer and he tattoos his chest with the main memorized clue: ""John G. murdered your wife"".This film has its own style and class. The idea itself about a guy who doesn't remember his experiences from a second ago is great. The ""reverse gear"" narration used here seems to be both logical and functional solution. Sometimes it is quite funny. For example, when the character doesn't know whether he chases someone or he is being chased."
"Review of Memento : The movie tells the story in a reversed order, which confuses people and keeps building suspense. It was fun to watch, but the story was not that worthy.The story is mediocre, which is about manipulation of a man that lost his short-term memory. Actually this seems a little unfair, because the writer decides when the protagonist starts forgetting things. So I won't say this movie has a good writing. Good writing shows consistency, which means the concept that makes up the movie should be taken through invariably. The Nolans did very well in The Prestige and Inception, but just no this one.However, the narration is innovative in a certain way: the confusion was just enough to drive me watching instead of forbidding me to undertand the plot.In recent years, they did Tenet which was not so well-received. That movie has a learning curve in its narration to make sure people following, but it tells a boring time-tralvel story, while the time-travel part is quite fancy. I think Tenet made the same mistake in this movie: they try to catch people's eyes with narration instead of solid plot."
"Review of Memento : I have always in mind that most of the films shown at The Sundance Film Festival in a way or in another are interesting, this is one of those.A despaired man has lost his ""immediate memory"" due to the murder and rape of his wife. His thirst of revenge but do not keep anything in his memory so he is obliged to tattoo and take notes of important events, names, places, etc.. The film is shot in a sort of flashback which you start to understand it after at least 30 minutes.It is an original film which has slightly reminded me the Italian film  ""The Mnemonist"", this one plays more with the spectator to get a sort of thrilling effect.Rating: 6/10"
"Review of Memento : ""Memento"" is told in reverse, which makes it hard to follow at times.  In normal chronological order this would be a normal run of the mill murder mystery.  It has the definite mood of film-noir.  I just do not understand why it is so highly regarded.  By telling a tale in reverse, does that make it a better film??"
"Review of Memento : It's a pretty cool idea. The last thing Leonard (Guy Pearce) remembers is someone killing his wife - since then he's had a head injury and has not been able to form new memories (a little like the start to Dark City). He takes pictures, makes notes, tattoos himself to try to order his life - but ultimately he does not know what he's doing. All that drives him is the desperate desire to track down the elusive 'John G.', who raped and murdered his wife. The film starts at the end of the story and works backwards (yes Raquel - backwards).  The only problem is, the scriptwriters seem to have suffered the same defect as their protagonist and forgot to wrap up all the questions actually posed at the start of their script.
Just when you're thinking ""This is a really clever piece of film!   I have no idea what the real answer is."" the screen goes blank and the credits start to roll. The story doesn't go back to who actually killed his wife, and dodges with some philosophy about 'who are we if we don't have our memories' - which is nice, but not strong or original enough to justify the weak script. Plus, this philosophical point is not exactly proven by the sudden ending - it would have been just as strong with some answers to the plot.Like: Who is Teddy? Why is he really involved? Was Leonard actually caught up with the other characters before his wife died? Why does he have two, apparently contradictory, sets of memories? Just a couple of big holes that lower the quality of what had the potential to be a really brilliant film. Still kudos to the acting, directing, and the 2/3rds of the script that they call a movie."
"Review of Memento : The film memento, which was created on October the 14th 2000 staring guy pearce as the main protagonist lenny who has a conditions which is called anterograde amnesia which basically means he cannot create new memories. Christopher Nolan directed the neo noir type film which grossed over 40million dollars. The film is about a guy called lenny who's wife got killed and now his motive is to kill ""john g"" in the film john g could potentially be made up and that he killed him a long time ago hid friend teddy explains this to him in the film but he seems not believe it at all so lenny is living in a kind of a circular narrative as what he does is in a circle. Moreover, the narrative for the film memento is fabula and sujet which is where the film starts all together but the takes two different paths in time as in the film when the scenes are in coloured frame its in the present and the black and white scenes are in the past. In my opinion I feel like the movie lets the audience kind have their own opinion's about it. Furthermore, the audiences who will enjoy this are people who like to put things together. Overall the film is very entertaining."
"Review of Memento : Aside from Guy Pearce and Carrie Anne-Moss's performances, and of course Christopher Nolan's overall talent as a director, I could not get invested in this film. I get that it is the kind of movie that many can be fascinated by given how it's structured with its themes and many of the plot elements, but the reversed plot and jumbled sequences were the same things that took me out of the film! Plus I really didn't care about the main character enough to be entirely emotionally invested in him and his arch. It loses me at quite a few spots and is so convoluted with multiple focal points that it ruined any chance of me truly enjoying it, even though I wanted to."
"Review of Memento : I'd always meant to watch this movie, mostly because I like Guy Pearce and have ever since L. A. Confidential, and because this movie got rave reviews when it came out.At first I was intrigued. It's a movie you watch during which you're very conscious of the fact that you're waiting for a big payoff that you hope will knock your socks off.It was pretty clever, after all. It would maybe make it more impressive if I knew why the cop was helping him (maybe they explain it at some point in the movie and I missed it).It's much more cerebrally interesting than emotionally gripping.I'd put it in somewhat the same vein as The Usual Suspects. I liked that movie much more, though, even though I guessed the ending, which I didn't with this one."
"Review of Memento : Don't believe the hype -- people seem to go out of their way to tell you how great this film is.  The truth is that, when it comes to the crunch, it's actually not really anything that special.Pearce, as the man who has no short term memory after he sustains a brain injury when his wife is raped and murdered, is competent enough, but this film does get really annoying in the way that it loops within the plot in order to get you back to the same point you were at 2 minutes ago -- and then moves onto the next scene.That was really annoying.A lot of this only makes sense in the last scene -- when the Sammy story finally comes to a point -- but by then it's taken an effort to sit through a lot of the rest of the film.Make no mistake, it's not bad, but it's not anything sensational either."
"Review of Memento : I know my opinion won't be popular, but after hearing the adoration for this film. I had to try it out. I've tried to watch this film a half a dozen times over the years. Never quite got thru it, until now.It's definitely not as convoluted as Tenet, but it's still a chore to watch. Before you begin to question my comprehensive abilities. I made sure I understood every plot point, idea, and twist. I even went as far as reading the entire plot to make sure I didn't miss a thing, and then I read it again. Maybe it's the high level of praise, but I just wasn't impressed.The final reveal didn't really blow me away. The payoff in Tenet was far better, but that film was an even bigger chore to watch. The Nolan's make great stuff, but they also go a little overboard sometimes. Inception, amazing. The Dark Knight, incredible. Memento, wake me up when it's over."
"Review of Memento : There have been several Hollywood films about loss of memory and patients suffering from amnesia. It was actually an overworked device for several years in order to develop a character with some type of motivation we do not know about. For the most part, it worked in several films , and failed in a few. In this one, it succeeds because of the sequence of events we are shown in flashback. Ask anyone over 75, and they will all tell you the same thing; where did I put my keys? Where did I put my credit card? Where was that pen I had yesterday? Short-term memory loss is not a big deal for them (or me), but it is a big deal when there are capital crimes involved. That is what makes the film interesting."
"Review of Memento : ""Memento"" is an American 110-minute movie from 2000, so not too long anymore until this one has its 20th anniversary. And a lot of its popularity such a long time later is of course because the director is Christopher Nolan from the UK, the man that many consider the most gifted filmmaker of our days, even if he still hasn't managed to get a Best Director nomination at the Oscars. But he received a nomination for his writing here as he also came up with the script together with his brother Jonathan. Nolan was only around the age of 30, maybe even under when he made this movie and it also has as many plot twists and moments that f*ck with your brain as many of his later works. So his style is easily identifiable in here. The one lead actor here is Guy Pearce and it is probably still the most known work of his career, even if he has appeared in several Best Picture winners. The supporting cast includes also several well-known names, maybe back then more than today, but still very recognizable, also several familiar faces from the small screen.So this one here is the story of a man who severely suffers from short term memory loss since the day his wife got murdered. There are situations when we know just as much as he does, but the longer the film goes the more we actually find out about his illness, his background and his motivations. And also about the ways in which he manages to help himself, especially when it comes to remembering things. His body is a sheet of paper basically. So yeah, I do believe that this film has some good moments, maybe even one or two great moments. But I still must say that Nolan occasionally went over the top here in terms of trying to make this movie as smart and mind-blowing as possible. It's of course a fine line, but back then he may not yet have had the talent to deliver really convincingly and walk that fine line from start to finish. This becomes especially visible in the second half of the film. I definitely enjoyed it more in the first 45 minutes. Acting is okay by everybody, but there is also nobody who really stands out, including Pearce. This is absolutely a writer's piece. What else can I say? Oh yeah. I did not really like the fact that it wasn't chronological. But that is very frequently the case for me and just subjective approach. I don't think it is subjective though when I say that this film overall is not as creative and memorable as it turned out in Nolan's head himself. Making an argument that I and other people who don't like it that much have just not understood it is not valid. There are flaws and weaknesses here that are occasionally pretty grave. So I am still relatively generous with my 3 stars out of 5 I would say. It is a joke that it is apparently according to IMDb voters one of the best 50 (not just 250, which would already be very exaggerated) films of all time. I do recommend it, but just cautiously. Definitely one of my least favorite Nolan works (maybe my actual least favorite from his full features). Don't expect too much or you will be majorly disappointed."
"Review of Memento : Good? I believe this story is good but how can a film maker get the idea of making the story backwards? It simple ridiculous. The plot follow through the story well but this movie will only suitable for expert users, someone who hold at least a bachelor degree to understand this movie well, otherwise, people might think it is a magic or fantasy movie.Also, the ending... what happened next? the screen just turn black and end title rolling. So... at least a last intro should be written. Anyway, enjoyable movie."
"Review of Memento : I can't believe the number of people that have been taken in by ""Memento"". Sure, it's a clever idea to start a murder mystery at the end and work back to the beginning.  However, it's just as well that ""Memento"" did it that way, because the story does NOT stand up to even average scrutiny.  Worse, it is played out in a sluggish manner, the conclusion of which would be obvious about 15 minutes before the denoument, had the film makers not resorted to cheating (Something a genuinely great film such as ""The Sixth Sense"" never did.The always excellent Guy Pierce plays a former insurance investigator who is searching for the men who raped and killed his wife and left him with brain damage, leaving him incapable of creating new memories. This forces Pierce to take some drastic actions (including tatooing his body with important clues) in order to maintain enough coherency to pursue his quest.  He is aided(?) by a waitress (Carrie-Ann) Moss and a mystery man (Joe Palantiano).  As, I said, the story plays itself out in reverse.  That's a pretty easy task, even for a student film maker.  Just edit the story out of sequence.  Big deal!DEFINITE SPOILERS AHEAD1. The film relies on coincidence.  Joe Palantiano's character has the same initials as the rapist. 2. Joe Palantiano is an undercover cop.  Yet, he never tells Pierce after the first killing, even when he knows Pierce could kill him. Certainly, if he is hanging around for the money, he might try looking in the trunk of Pierce's car.  Pierce probably doesn't know it is there. 3. Pierce has false memories which deceive the audience. 4. Dodd, the ""big time"" drug dealer comes alone, even though a HUGE amount of cash is involved.  By the way, just WHERE does a guy with no memory hide a huge stash of cash? 5. Dodd is easily subdued by Pierce. 6. Moss's characters actions are inconsistent. An interesting experiment, but rather sluggish and with unsympathetic characters."
"Review of Memento : A man is determined to avenge the murder of his wife, but his mission is complicated by the fact that he suffers from short-term memory loss. The film is unique in that it tells the story backwards, starting at the end and moving to the beginning scene by scene. The purpose of this narrative device is to let the viewer experience what the protagonist is going through. It may have seemed like a clever idea on paper, but it makes for a muddled and unsatisfying film. The plot is preposterous and there are too many loose ends. Nolan seems more interested in propagating a gimmick than in telling a compelling story. It's not bad, but it's really not worth the trouble. Pearce is good."
"Review of Memento : Another cleverly done example of backwards story telling, from the Pulp Fiction school..  Unlike Pulp Fiction, the backwards element got annoying and tiresome fast in this film.  It certainly was a creepy film, maybe even affecting (time will tell, since I just watched it), but I didn't find it all that enjoyable.  The ending was unsatisfying for me, after sitting through the previous hour and fifty minutes (yes, I found myself watching the clock to count down when it would wrap up).  I suppose I could get a bit more out of it with repeated watchings, but I don't really care enough to bother with that.  I would give this one a 5/10, although few of you will probably agree with me so let the flames begin!"
"Review of Memento : I just don't understand what it is that makes this movie so popular, especially with male viewers, I mean 8.6? Come on, what is that?! ...Leonard suffers from short-term memory loss and tracks back using notes and body parts to find the man who killed his wife. On his journey he encounters a number of people who he has to be able to assess at first sight because of his deficiency.The acting by Guy Pearce is very convincing and even appealing but the story however is most of the time way too irritating because you constantly have to backtrack yourself in order to completely understand what's going on. I like flashbacks in movies but a film that turns out to be one big flashback by itself may be a little too demanding for me. I guess this is just not my kind of entertainment ..."
"Review of Memento : Before I rant on the absurdity of Memento being currently ranked #14 on the Top 250 list, I'll say what I liked about it. Yes, it was an extremely entertaining, original and well-done all around film. The acting was first rate, the story decent, and the film makers did a great job putting it all together.However, I may be crazy, and I'm sure the ""film snobs"" will grit their teeth at this, but at the end of the day, isn't Memento just a gimmick? A water cooler novelty? I mean, basically they took a slightly above average plot and did something new, and granted inventive, by editing the film structure in reverse. For the most part, the movie is pretty much shown from end to beginning. Yes, they did enough to make things make sense in between, but essentially it was an exercise in ""hey, let's make a movie, and then edit it so everyone will talk about that reverse movie"".I don't care what anyone says. That's the bottom line, period. I've talked with plenty of fellow movie buffs who I consider to be reasonably intelligent, and some are even the snob-types mentioned above. And none of us can figure out what all the fuss is about. Maybe we ain't that smart.I hate to get into comparisons, because it's difficult to compare different types of movies. But be honest, if you can tell me with a straight face that Memento is an overall better film than ""Apocalypse Now"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Fight Club"", ""Jaws"", ""Chinatown"", ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"", ""American Beauty"", ""Silence of the Lambs"" and a large chunk of the other 230 films ranked below it, than you just need to sit back, take a deep breath, reel in that massive ""I'm a nonconformist art-house movie aficionado"" thing and get a reality check. It was a good movie, but it wasn't that good."
"Review of Memento : I saw this movie around five years ago so you'll have to forgive me if you're a fan. The truth is I was not blown away by this 'diabolical thriller'. Sure it leaves you scratching your head but is that necessarily a good thing? It may be a 'super intelligent' movie but that does not necessarily make it good art. I remember the acting as being semi-wooden, the production values low, and the dialog sparse. Is it a confusing movie? Absolutely. Will it makexsense if you watch it a dozen times? Probably. But I still would not count this as one of the top 250 movies of all time. That said, my hat off to a truly original script"
"Review of Memento : You know, this movie has everything to be an awesome movie. The main actors, Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss deserve an Oscar for such a professional acting. The originality of ""Memento"" is also pleasant, I myself had never seen a similar story in a movie. But something in this plot didn't satisfy me. The story was very confusing, there are flashbacks all the time, and it becomes boring once we get lost in the mystery.I have to admit I didn't make it to the end... as stated before, once I got lost in the story it became very boring. And it's not my fault as a viewer to don't get things straight: they (the writers) are supposed to make me want to follow their thoughts, otherwise movies wouldn't be classified as entertainment."
"Review of Memento : This movie has a nice idea that it stretches out too long. It's not a bad movie, but knowing the ending and story takes all of the suspense and questions of the movie. A counterexample would be Fight Club, where the ending adds a real twist to the whole movie but dosen't spoil it for the next time you view it, you just view it with different eyes, as Fight Club has more to offer than the ending.Some SPOILERS are ahead due to the nature of the movie. I don't think they will spoil the movie totally for you, but they might lower your expectations towards this movie, and you might even decide not to spend money or precious time on it :The movie is told backwards, so the viewer has no memory of what happened ""before"", like the protagonist. The plot has (in retrospect) some holes that don't get filled, mostly regarding Dodd, a seemingly key figure, who in the end is completely insubstantial.I expected a murder mystery movie bordering towards a film noir, but except for the explanation at the films end (and thus, at the beginning of the story), the story is completely banal. The story is climatic towards the end of the movie, but the end dosen't live up to the suspense that was built up during the movie.As Leonard has conditioned himself to operate on a few promises, he reacts to every situation in the same manner, which makes many scenes repetitive. Partly, this is necessary to demonstrate how he ticks, partly this is entertaining as the viewer already knows how Leonard will react in a scene, but the whole concept is stretched too long like a running gag repeated some times too often. The film would be better entertainment if it wasn't 2 hours long."
"Review of Memento : If 'Memento' was released this year, there is absolutely no chance it would achieve the average rating of 8.5 that is currently has on IMDb. That rating puts 'Memento' in the top 50 highest rated movies of all time. To say that such a ranking is misleading would be an understatement.This film is unique and like nothing that had previously been attempted before its release. The plot is ambitious and intelligently told, giving the audience an insight into the mind of a short-term memory loss sufferer. The film makes for absorbing, but also frustrating viewing. I got the impression that 'Memento' thinks its better than it really is.Overall, a decent and unique thriller, but the rating is misleading and not a true reflection of the quality of the film. Interesting? Yes. Top 50 of all time? No!"
"Review of Memento : This movie tries to be complex, but instead of achieving it by means of a clever plot, it creates a fake complexity through a messy editing. It presents the story through half scenes shown in a mixed chronological order so that the trick to follow it is to ""remember"" (get it?) everything and put the pieces together in a way that it makes sense.
The thing is, maybe you're not up to play a memory game for two hours, maybe you just want to watch a movie, and if you don't play along you end up just watching stuff happen.
This chronology puzzle can be entertaining at first but it quickly becomes monotonous and boring, it's two hours of nealy identical scenarios and dialogs repeated over and over again, and by the time you have all the pieces to put everything together, you simply don't care anymore because all you want is for the movie to end.Lastly, the protagonist's condition on which the story relies on is too far-fetched for my suspension of disbelief to handle (don't worry, not a spoiler): a person with brain trauma that left him with an impaired short them memory and is unable to make new memories. Someone with such condition should be barely able to function in every day life without a care-taker, but being independent to such degree? And the most obvious question, how does he remember he has such condition in the first place?"
"Review of Memento : ...and his brain. For example: Why on earth isn´t he using a dictaphone? You know some sort of recording device!?Spoilers: He can remember after all always to bring that camera and the pictures. Why not record your impressions on tape like ""I parked a blue Chevy outside the Seven Eleven"". Would be so much easier. Oh, my mistake. But some kind of wonder he can recall his car and where he parked. But he can not remember that Carrie-Ann is double-crossing him.
So if you don´t care for any logic in a movie and you are willingly fo fall for a gimmick namely telling something backwards this is the right movie for you. Macaulay J. Connor still 1/10"
"Review of Memento : It's certainly a unique concept. Leonard, played by Guy Pearce, is a man who has no short-term memory after being attacked when trying to save his wife from a rape-murder. The rest of his life is spent in a quest for revenge - a revenge he can't remember if he's ever been able to achieve because he has no short-term memory. That's an interesting enough premise, the added piece here being the decision to offer us the story in reverse chronology - beginning with Leonard killing the man he believes to be his wife's killer (played by Joe Pantoliano) and then scene by scene retracing the story, going back just a bit at a time to fill in the details of his search, and how he came to the conclusion that Teddy was responsible. Essentially, then, the viewer is pulled into Leonard's own condition - seeing what's happening with no clue as to how it came about because we haven't seen what came before. Edited into the regression scenes are black and white scenes in which Leonard, holed up in his hotel room, essentially talks about his condition and seems to fill in some essential details about his past.It's an interesting way to present a ""whodunit"" - because the question all the way through is whether Teddy is actually the killer. The ending offers up a twist - although it isn't the biggest surprise you'll ever see, if only because the way the movie is put together you're conditioned from the beginning to expect pretty much any twist possible, it still leaves open a decent bit of uncertainty about who actually killed Lenny's wife. So, the premise and construction of the story is interesting enough. Also interesting, though, is that - while it's intriguing - I just didn't find it particularly enjoyable to watch. Perhaps it's because I didn't buy Leonard's condition - for one reason. He used photographs to jog his memory, so he took pictures of important people, places, etc,. to refer to when necessary. What's wrong with that? Well - nothing, I suppose, except that I found it passing strange that, for a guy who supposedly forgets everything within a couple of minutes of it happening, he always knew exactly which pocket to find the pictures in. He NEVER had to search for one of his photographs; there was never even a moment of hesitation when he had to refer to one. That's a small point, perhaps, but it caused a bit of a credibility gap for me. The movie's well acted by the leads and interesting enough as the pieces of the puzzle are sorted out, but for me it fizzled a bit on that admittedly relatively small point. 5/10"
"Review of Memento : I did not get into this movie. I like the director and the star, but just didn't care about the story. It is well made and structured, so I would recommend most people give it a try, I just personally didn't respond to it."
"Review of Memento : I didn't have too much trouble following this film after the first ten minutes - maybe because I'm a touch dyslexic, and I'd seen the backward Seinfeld wedding-in-India episode several times. It was ingenious that while the central character had his puzzle to figure out, we as an audience were given one that paralleled his.But the further Memento progressed, the more I felt that I neither liked nor related to any of the characters, who become more one-dimensional the further back in time we encounter them, and that then becomes who they really are. It's not a film I would have cared to see had it been chronological.Take Groundhog Day, make it the others in the film who know what's going on, then change it from a comedy to a moody thriller with a bunch of sleazeballs, and you have Memento. It gives the impression not only that nothing is as it seems, but that no one can be trusted, and everyone is parasitic when given the opportunity. It's sad that so many people have praised it, given it's jaundiced view of humanity.Yes, it's a milestone, a new Third Man for the new century. I recommend it only as a study in film-making and storytelling. You may smile at the tricks in the unfolding of the magic. But if you have the simple desire to see real, complex characters -- with both good sides and human failings -- they won't turn up in Memento.By the end - or beginning, as it were -- the completion of the puzzle only creates an ugly, slimy picture. It's like watching the magician pull a dead rabbit from his hat. At a different time in my life, I'd have been a lot more impressed."
"Review of Memento : There are spoilers in this review.This is your chance to see Guy Pearce as a bleached-blonde SoCal Calvin Klein model.  Not only that, but he is also half-naked during the entire film as the camera pans up and down his body.  Guy in the shower, Guy on the bed, Guy getting dressed.  Like it or not, you're going to see Guy Pearce's body, dammit.This film is strongly reminiscent of the Seinfeld episode where everything goes backward, the one where Sue Ellen Mischke gets married in India.  I wonder if the screenwriter was inspired by that show.Anyway, Pearce plays a man who has no short-term memory, so he has to write down everything.  This is a thinking person's film, which cleverly challenges your own short-term memory as you try to remember how each vignette ties into the previous one.  It works, but after awhile it becomes formulaic.  Joe Pantoliano's character is utterly unconvincing as a police officer.  He is such a simpering milquetoast, and his friendship with Guy is so weak, that you wonder about his motivation for helping Guy.  It is never clearly demonstrated.Major spoiler alert in this paragraph.  The problem I have with the ending is that it is so unsatisfying.  It does not clearly demonstrate Guy's motivation for `finding new challenges'.  His writing down of Teddy's license plate is so contrived and unlikely, and largely unexplained, that the whole film falls apart.  It is as though Leonard is inventing challenges just to keep himself busy; it is such an empty, unsatisfying conclusion that one wonders if there are a group of screenwriters somewhere whose job it is to create silly movie endings, such as those in `The Ring' and `Donnie Darko'.  A lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.On IMDB's scale, this movie deserves a five."
"Review of Memento : I gave a five because I found the intertwining storyline to be original and appealing but not more. The interweaving lead namely in my case to a complete chaos and I must confess I did not get the plot in the end. Christopher Nolan is great (thinking of Prestige or Batman Begins, the best Batman picture so far), really, but I couldn't follow him on this one.I could have done without the story still, but the cast could also have been better. Carrie-Ann Moss can't act. She couldn't act in Matrix, and she still can not. Joe Pantoliano was uninteresting as Teddy and although Guy Pearce gave a strong performance, well, it wasn't enough to save the day for me.I recommend this movie for people who have either been acquainted with the short story somehow before in the first place, or for avid fans of someone having to do with the movie because I can't imagine that anyone impartial might fall for it."
"Review of Memento : I'm not trying to be dramatic but I don't get how the rating for this movie is so high. If you're looking for a high rated IMDb movie to watch, this is NOT IT. You find yourself constantly waiting for something to happen for not only a letdown of an ending, but an unexplained ""not worth the wait"" reveal. I was expecting way more from this movie because I love Christopher Nolan but man this was so stupid and it made no sense to me. Maybe it was good in its time? I don't know. I would never watch this again nor recommend it to anyone unless I hated them. I will say that the way it was filmed reverse-chronologically was cool in theory, but not really that enjoyable tbh. 5/10 for the attempt, I guess? The acting was decent too."
"Review of Memento : Surprise endings don't excuse complicated, explanatory meanderings.  The story is much more shrewd than the film makes it out to be -- things are still falling into place long after the credits have stopped rolling.Kind of slow, forcing you to give it a chance, since we presume to know the rest.  Through all the billowing sequences and finally settling for some lucid crime/detective/drug theme, at the end the surprises pop out and BOOM credits roll, but only after a very cocky, humorous Guy Pearce says with the utmost pretension ""Now, where was I?""  You can almost hear the filmmakers sneering into your ear ""Aren't we just so goddamn clever?""Yeah, you were clever...but not much else.5 Fight Club insinuations out of 10."
"Review of Memento : the most annoying thing about this movie is that people claim to like it because it's so revolutionary in it's style and complexity... Cause then i look back on other movies, like 'lost highway' and everyone hates it. Well folks this movie isn't all that revolutionary. First off i'd like to mention a certain convience of this movie, how can the main character remember that he has a memory disorder, yet can't remember anything else? Think about it, he'd constantly live in the present, and be completely unaware of living in the present, the only way he'd know he was living in the present would be if someone was there to tell him that. So that's a MAJOR plot hole. that's not the worst thing about the movie, the worst thing is that the character's are flat, the plot is flat - C'mon a plot about a guy searching for the guy who killed his wife, with NO twists (if seen without the contrived plot)boring characters, and lame dialogue. Watched in regular motion this movie is not interesting at all. Some people were comparing this to Lynch. Well, comparing it to what lynch has done so far, he ALWAYS uses interesting characters and great atmosphere to tell his stories, not just some lame plot contrivance. The movie isn't terrible, it has it's moments, but it's annoying that it's getting so much praise when movies like lost highway get trashed. Look at Pulp Fiction, Tarantino didn't use just the plot contrivence to make his movie interesting... oh ya and i didn't re read this, bollocks to all the grammar and spelling errors!5/10 Boring, contrived story, with flat characters, the only saving grace is the surprises that occasionally pop up. Although the movie is ultimately completely let down by a REALLY lame ending, c'mon, they could've thought of something more interesting... If they had i would've considered giving this a 6 or 7. NOT A MASTERPIECE ~!!! Watch Pulp Fiction or The Killing if you wanna see a uniquely told story with Good characters and good dialogue."
"Review of Memento : I saw this movie and I think it is good. The way it is played out is very unique, if not a little confusing at times. Still it was a good movie. The actors did a very good job, especially the lead characters. But to have this movie ranked number ten, on the list of 250 best, is a travesty."
"Review of Memento : I cannot tell you how many recent movies I have seen that start with the character in a screwed up situation, then backtell how he got there. I hate it! It's like a spoiler for the whole film! It takes away all the mystery, it's like someone telling you when you are going to die. Why go on living? Why go on watching such a film? Just Married and Salton Sea are two recent copy cat examples. I guess it is the latest style. And what about all these absurd movies trying to be like Fargo or a Tarantino flick, example Orange County.This film is like all those, rolled into one. This film is very clever with the main character having no short term memory but that is where it ends. It is NOT top 250 material. I think that the ranking system is screwed up or something. It is better than 238 of the best films of all time? Helloooooooooo?It is a crappy overused story, told in an unusual way with ok acting. Wife is killed, person seeking the murderer etc etc."
"Review of Memento : And unanswered questions.But i guess thats the point of this film..? You dont know whats happened or hasnt happened to Leonard, Natalie or anyone really. I suppose it plays on the whole ""mind plays tricks on you"" thing but i dunno for me the story and plot missed something. Altough lots of movies dont really conclude and are left open i feel like they could have included Teddy more and Natalie less.But Nolan always has to have some sort of love story, infatuation or strong lust between a man and woman characters which kind of bothers me about him. Nolan can def do without that element in his films. Hes great but the best directors dont color inside the lines. Nolon def doesnt in terms of stories but he does when it involves the relations between men and women.Anywho its an okay movie but anything above 7 is kind silly for this moive. Worth the watch while not intoxicated."
"Review of Memento : Elegantly acted, and interesting put together, but so messy, and with so many plot holes, that it became distracting. Friends and I who had seen the movie discussed it afterwards, and while we were intrigued and interested in the devices used in the film, ultimately, it simply didn't hold up. Were it 10% less jerked-around, I think it could have held much more tension. The concept was nevertheless fascinating, and I recommend that you see it once to see what experimental film is all about. True, I believe: there are no (or few) new stories; only different ways of telling them. This was about as original as it gets, though."
"Review of Memento : At first I really loved the film. Mostly the idea of momentarily loss of memory (""memento"" may mean that.If so, forgive me)  and going backwards. But When I searched for the details, I've found out some details that comes unlogical to me. Mainly I could not understand how long or until which condition Lenny's memory lasts. In one scene he forgets the events at that moment even while he is trying not to forget ( while looking for a pen). However in another scene he gets up from the bed in the girl's house and directly finds his notebook!(I think) In general the idea was excellent but I think it must be thought more on the details."
"Review of Memento : Now, after watching the movie second time in 2019 I must conclude: a highly over-rated one trick pony. Maybe it's time, maybe it's me, but this movie is not worth 8+ points in IMDB - not even near. The plot and screenplay is confusing, the acting is fine, but nothing too special there. Please accept my apologizes, but this is average at its' best. Sorry."
"Review of Memento : if you are interested to explore another film about thesubjectiveness of 'memory'', check out this brilliant film fromChina, Yangguang Canlan de Rizi (aka In the Heat of the Sun). 
i tried to rewind the film and see how it would be like to watch afilm from the end to the beginning, i saw repetition, jumping editingand this covers the incomplete storyline underneath.  it left with mea terrible headache.  it is a hollow story, with shallow characterswhich come from nowhere.   i do not have a clue why it can be ranked #12 of the list."
"Review of Memento : Anyone who says they understand this film after one, or even two viewings, is lying! I don't think either Nolan or Pearce fully understand it - indeed I suspect there's a deliberate intent to confuse! Personally i think it is trying to be a bit too clever, and it doesn't quite succeed in achieving what it sets out to (unless that was purely confusion!) The first hour is so slow and bewildering I found myself starting to pick holes in the plot and continuity, of which there are a great many. Shot over 25 days and with little room for error, I guess the faults are understandable. The problem is the story doesn't hold your attention long enough to mask them.I suspect after a second viewing I may feel more comfortable with it, but I shall need a long time to recover from the numbness caused by the brain-scrambling complexity of this story. I'm tempted to describe it as pretentious, but I don't think that's entirely fair. Yes it's trying to be clever, but I don't think it's trying to deceive. Nolan is a fairly inexperienced director and I think he has much to offer, so I'm going to cut him some slack. Maybe he bit off more than he could chew with Memento, but you can't accuse him of being boring. I shall certainly be paying close attention to his future projects, as well as trying to unearth some of his early stuff.I think this movie should come with an instruction manual, but failing that perhaps it would be better to get the DVD and watch the interview before the movie. I don't think it will spoil it, and may ease some of the pain. Unfortunately I think it's appeal will be severely limited, and many people will - understandably - be irritated by it. It needs working at, which perhaps isn't what movies are about. After all, this is supposed to be the entertainment industry. If you understand and accept that this film is not light entertainment, and will leave you with more questions than answers, then you must watch it. If nothing else it inspires great debate, which is a good sign for the industry as a whole. I will simply sum it up as flawed, but fascinating."
"Review of Memento : Don't get me wrong, the storyline is authentic in it's entirety. Casting for the film was on point, but the way it was broken down lacked back story. In a way, I suppose the movie was intended to be that way to put you in the shoes of Leonard. But even so, I was expecting MORE the whole movie. I'm reading other reviews and they were glued to the screen yet I found the film to be condescending and easy to drive my attention away from. Even the ending, I was expecting something after the fact of how finally Leonard got his revenge and it would carry from there. Felt like I got sucked into the reviews of this one to be majorly disappointed! And I'm an AVID Christopher Nolan fan. I will be one of those who will not recommend this movie and am honestly shocked by those who are a fan of this film."
"Review of Memento : I've heard good things around this movie. So I was really excited to watch it. In the end, I honestly didn't enjoy it. I think it's because of the gimmick of everything being told backwards. By the first hour I was getting used to it, but I can't say I enjoyed this kind of storytelling. Since the viewer has seen the scenes that are the results of the next scenes. It didn't keep me interested.Maybe if the charactets were interesting and I felt something for them maybe I could overlook it. But no. The main character is very uninteresting, and throughout the film I just don't care for his revenge story.If you want to watch a good mystery thriller, I recommend Seven."
"Review of Memento : having been given recommendations from friends to watch this film, i duly booked a night in to watch it. what a mistake. i believe this is the most over-rated film in history. ok, the film was original yes. but entertaining? no, not in the slightest. even after watching it on another 2 occasions, my views haven't changed.!"
"Review of Memento : Very little substance in this movie, with the gimmick (very well done) of telling the story in non-continuous sequences and almost in reverse order. But it is a frustrating and non-rewarding movie that cheats the audience at every step:  a fictitious illness, characters that do things more to startle the audience rather than for a realistic reason, and an ending that is way too predictable and really silly at the same time. Basically, if you told the movie in a normal fashion, it would show more holes than a certain cheese I am fond of."
"Review of Memento : Phew, what a ride! A stunning piece of art! Or maybe not. You don't need any substance, just make some clever surprises, and the mediocre pepsi-drinkers think it's brilliant. Maybe some good entertainment in a hangover, but not worth watching another time, which is a good reason enough to say: Memento is NOT a masterpiece, just a somewhat handy and therefore empty piece of postmodern dullness.Why is it that movies get so easily attention by shallow tricks? In the beginning I thought that Memento might have some levels, but the feeling of mystery involved can all be reduced to the plot, not to the theme, which is just some insignificant decoration on filmmakers' intellectual masturbation, not like in Donnie Darko, for example, in which the complex elements are related to some content.All I'm saying, not a terrible movie, but you gotta be kidding saying it's ""highly intellectual"" or a ""masterpiece"". Unless you are uneducated or just dull."
"Review of Memento : When I saw Memento in theatres I left feeling numb. The film did absolutely nothing for me---in fact, I found it intensely awful. Hearing so many positive things about the film and taken by the possibility that it might've been my mood, I decided to revisit it when it appeared on my movie cable channel. I found myself appreciating Mr. Nolan's directing more at home, and Mr. Pearce's performance stood out the second time around. What remained the same, however, was the complete lack of interest I had in the story. It seems Mr. Nolan was so pleased with the gimmick he had that there was little atttention paid to generating suspense and creating involving and/or compelling characters. There were moments at home when I was entertained by the film, but I was never fully interested in it. If I really want to watch a reverse chronology film I'll take ""The Betrayal"" over this any day. My rating: 2/5Sidenote: I look forward to Insomnia, however, if only because I know that one will have an interesting story."
"Review of Memento : But not as clever as others have made out. The first hour is confusing, its supposed to be. The whole point of this film is to keep you guessing until the final scene where the whole thing comes together. I just thought that the final revelation wasn't that mind-blowing and a bit disappointing. One other point that I didn't think was too realistic was how quickly everybody around the main character accepted and adapted to his condition in order to exploit him.All in all its a good film with excellent performances from Pearce and Moss and is different to anything else I've ever seen - 7/10."
"Review of Memento : This is nothing special and I find it hard to accept the high voting for this film. The ending is so unspectacular and a huge anti-climax. With the excessive amount of time-shifting with scenes not shown in chronological order - it just overly confuses and irritates. Pulp Fiction for example did a much better job of this, but here scenes were all over the place and made the film difficult to follow. I stuck with it thinking that the ending will make sense of it all and will be worth the wait- but that turned out be very disappointing. Yes it has some clever moments in it but one viewing was enough for me-the film just doesn't interest to justify watching it again."
"Review of Memento : I think that the people who gave this a decent vote must have been watching the wrong film. May I suggest you go back and have another look. If they told this story fowards it would have received about 3.0 and although it may be ""clever"" to tell the story in this backwards forwards whatever format I think the film would have benefitted greatly from being set in space or possibly under the sea."
"Review of Memento : Fragmented, disjointed, unsequential story and screenplay, is innovative and certainly attention-getting, but ultimately mutes the emotional impact of film.  Too few moments when the viewers here could connect, possibly because you have to work so hard continuously to figure out what is going on.  An intricate cerebral puzzle but without passion."
"Review of Memento : After seeing how many people loved this flick, I am surprised.  I guess you should be wide awake and completely alert to watch it.  I was tired and I could not wait for this movie to end.  It left too many questions unanswered at the end.  I will admit that it was an interesting way to film a thriller."
"Review of Memento : Since I've started watching and reviewing movies, I was searching for innovation and fantastically. What then happened, it proved actually that my theory about British directors have stile, been wrong. That was when I saw Memento At first, I found it unusual that the film begins extremely violent, do even the most controversial films ever made, like Cannibal Holocaust, or (what's more possible that this film is a copy of that movie) Pulp Fiction, don't begin by killing people, by showing how they die. Its true that's a shock for the audience and that they will stay to see the movie, but the next move, was so unprofessional, like he did never get a video camera in his hands. He broke the main rule, of every filmmaker that ever broke a rule. He tortured the audience by showing too many flashbacks. The rule, of every film is not to do a same thing more then 3 times or 7 times but not at once. Even if you look at Pulp fiction, it's got not less then 7, yeah, seven my friends, seven! Memento's got 22 jumps. A man, a normal human, looses every wish to see a thing if you have repeated something more then 11 times. I'm somehow surprised that it became a success. I have nothing against the actors, because Nolan chooses quite well actors. What I'm really mad, are the characters In every Nolan movie! The characters are mean, evil, stupid I mean, you don't have to think in Nolan's movies, they tell you anything at the end, so you have to just watch the end, cause anything else it for throwing away: the horrible music, poor characters and no style directing, only some trademarks, but nothing else. But let's go back to Memento You may have notice that the characters are changing, but from good up to evil. This lends realism, that's for sure, but it does not automatically made a great feature. Some of you would probably say that a man gets rotten, because the society wont help him with his problem, but that's not the case in Memento. Leo's the guy who actually killed the only person, who was ever kind to him, and understood his problem, Teddy, what makes Leonard a guy, who doesn't want any help from anyone which turns his character not into a anti hero, but more a antagonist: he has no purpose, he doesn't want any help, he loves nobody a villain. Finally, some of you might think that I'm only writhing bad reviews all the time, but true's that I love much worse movies and writhe reviews that show how charming films are. I even see something positive in Michael Bays films, but this film doesn't have a place at IMDb top 250.I'll give this film a rating 5.6 out-ha 10.0, cause I still think that the idea to have a whole film going backwards nice. As well the actors are pretty good, and its not easy to forget such a film, but its nothing special or innovative. Its mean, evil, not well directed and overrated"
"Review of Memento : The backwards story was interesting, but the plot was no longer exciting.
The movie was only OK because story told backwards was positive
and weak plot was negative. A total of 4/10."
"Review of Memento : This movie is waaaaaayyyy too confusing to even be considered one of the best of all time. Guy Pearce is super in it and the acting is wonderful. I like the idea and the concept of telling the story is pretty original. But wow!!! What a bummer ending. It works up all this suspense and intrigue and you find out, the story we saw was for nothing???? I don't mind not knowing everything, but not knowing anything???? Not acceptable. I didn't like it and call me stupid, but after being intrigued and following along the whole time, the ending is just too stupid. At one point, I was just ready to get the movie over with. Not something a movie should want me to do. There is some entertainment value, but at some point, it becomes too complicated to even really care. That's how I felt. This movie is pretty overrated for where it is in the standings. It's half-way decent, and DEFINITELY NOT ONE OF THE 20 BEST FILMS EVER MADE!!!! Go see the Usual Suspects instead."
Review of Memento : Not my cup of tea I must say... Been looking on search engine on the internet for the best thriller movies... And this one was amongst a lot of good movies I've seen... But not a +8 movie for me....
"Review of Memento : I mentally checked out after fifteen minutes, because I neither cared for the plot nor its main character. So a guy who has short-time memory loss accidentally kills his wife, doesn't remember it, gets screwed over by a bartender, a motel owner and a cop. Then the protagonist kills two more people and cannot admit to himself that his quest for vengeance doesn't lead anywhere. I suppose I can see what the purpose of the movie is supposed to be, but it's neither particularly deep, nor has a positive message. It just tells you that people will screw you over if you are mentally challenged and that people lie to themselves. That movie is the definition of ""overhyped"" and is not worth more than 4 stars."
"Review of Memento : I was recommended this film by someone whose opinion I value. Perhaps consequently my expectations were too high and I was left just feeling disappointed.The positive thing about the film is that it did give an insight into how confusing life must be with this kind of short-term memory disorder - but so what?, is that supposed to be entertainment?It's a novel approach to show the ending of a film first and then work backwards but it made the (otherwise very simple) plot overly complicated and more like a memory-test puzzle than a film.The acting was good enough but I think that overall this film is greatly overrated - how on earth did it get in the ImDB top 10?Algis Kuliukas"
"Review of Memento : Watch this movie only if you absolutely have nothing better to do for two hours. The storyline contains an interesting idea but is portrayed in a boring predictable manner. The characters are as dull as the writing. I found it near impossible to relate to any of the characters as they are flat and emotionless, it felt like I wasn't even watching real people. I was disappointed in Guy Pearce's performance and a little surprised that Joe Pantoliano's character was the best part of this movie but it was not enough to make it a good film. I feel like the movie had to run in reverse otherwise it wouldn't be worth watching at all. The stability of the plot is constantly contradicting its self and is at times way over complicated. The flashbacks and narration really seem to distract from the story, not that it's that believable anyway with its lack of continuity. Since the events play out in reverse you already know what is going to happen and that completely eliminates any suspense. I believe with a better script and character development this movie could have been a lot better. I personally enjoyed the short story much better and wish the movie was more like the that. Definitely read the short story."
"Review of Memento : *Tiny unspoilers within*No, it's not a dig aimed at the formerly great MGM, I talk of Memento. Intelligent film making? Perhaps. An intelligent film? I think not! In this post Tarantino age of cinema this is what passes for a masterpiece, god help us! It was Tarantino's Pulp Fiction that sparked this brave new age of cinema we are currently suffering, the age of mediocre is the new good. It is so fitting that the so called benchmark for film making in the 21st century should be the personification of style over substance. In fact there is hardly anything worth extracting from this self congratulatory thriller other than the over stylized imagery and technical wizardry on show. This film is stone cold, a lifeless film made purely for your aesthetic pleasure.The premise for the film IS intriguing, the director provided himself remarkable scope in which to create a fantastically gripping thriller by virtue of the protagonist's 'condition' combined with a muddled take on the old reverse narrative. This allowed him the chance to chop up the plot and deliver the punch line from each segment first then show us the events leading up to that point. This is fascinating the first couple of times, but by the 4th I was thinking ""wow, that's getting old fast"" by the 8th time I just wanted the punishment to stop. The narrative device is purely and simply a clever gimmick, and one that is clearly wasted on such a banal story. The argument has been used that the connect the dots narrative structure is the only thing that makes it intriguing. Heck, so what? It is possible to take a half decent plot and spin gold from straw with the right narrative structure. Not here though, even told in reverse it had no worth in my eyes because the plot is beyond redemption. A thriller should be thrilling, this film is snail paced and instead of being intriguing the narrative structure quickly begins to resemble someone desperately trying to draw blood from a stone, futile. Further more a thriller or drama should have interesting characters and a bit of intrigue. The plot was not captivating, the situation was not captivating, the characters were not captivating and I did not care about them, especially not Lenny and his questionable motives.There is not one good character in this film, not surprising since the actors don't have any challenging dialog to work with. Also they look like they were sleepwalking through filming, only Pantoliano attempts to bring anything resembling life to this turkey. I can almost forgive Pearce as he is playing a vengeful, obsessive psycho, and he has no short term memory so he might well have zero personality or emotion for good reason. However Moss' character is simply a horrible film noir cliché, the femme fetale, and she performs the role with no style whatsoever, perhaps because she has little work with. All she is required to do is look moody and menacing and be a bitch. Please, can nobody come up with good characters these days? The effect is not good at all, I felt these characters and the swiss cheese style excuse for a thriller/drama were spat out as the appendix for a Nolan master class in technical magic and whiz bang editing. The cast are rendered pointless by a senseless plot that only exists to be manipulated and rearranged to display the fact you can take a terrible story, mix it up beyond recognition and somehow disguise it as some sort of epiphany, a la Pulp Fiction.Then the ending (sorry beginning?) was just the icing on this grotesquely elaborate cake, I don't want to totally spoil it for those who have not seen it as the surprise of having your head deflated in disappointment is one not to be spoiled. It's suffice to say the preceding events were rendered even more senseless by the anticlimactic conclusion, I had not seen an ending this whiffy since Fight Club (later bettered by Mulholland Drive). I was left apathetic and cold by the conclusion to this 'riddle' that seemingly offered two possibilities, neither of which would validate the rest of the miserable excuse for a film. Why? Because I didn't care! Memento (and it's message) is like ouroboros in the most literal sense - circular, self contained, endless and ultimately pointless. Forgive my apparent artistic blindness, I DO appreciate creativity and inventiveness, my message to Mr Nolan and his peers would be ""please use it to INVENT a decent story!"" In reflection, perhaps the most annoying thing isn't that Memento is so mediocre in every way, it's the fact that it has been so widely regarded as a great film, much like the two putrid films that it rooted from - Fight Club and Pulp Fiction. I don't know, my friends say I am a cynic and the harshest of harsh critics, well I simply say I am just reflecting on a harsh and cynical world that thrives on misery and depression like they are going out of fashion. With the rapid development of special effects, filming equipment and creativity in cinema it's easy to look back on the 'golden eras' of cinema and chuckle at the technical integrity and naive world view of some of the oldies. However it almost makes me want to shed a tear that cinema has come such a long way technically but sadly seems to have lost the values that used to be at it's heart. Films used to tell stories, they used to have REAL characters and had soul and substance. Now I look at the 'classics' of todays material world - films like Pulp Fiction, Memento, American Beauty and Fight Club and I see nothing but hate, cynicism, sharp emotionless dialog, 2 dimensional characters and most importantly style over everything else, a sad but accurate reflection of the age we live in? Indeed."
"Review of Memento : This movie's strength is that it keeps your attention, trying to figure out just what the heck is going on.  It's well made, but suffers mainly from being too cryptic.  I'm not a stupid person, but I can't imagine anyone with an IQ of only 100 being able to figure out what's going on and therefore to enjoy it.  (I'm sure the viewers who gave it a ""10"" will be duly flattered.) By the time the movie ends, you have a wonderful idea of what it must be like to lack short-term memory -- the director and editor did an outstanding job here -- but as a viewer you are still owed a denouement, and what you get isn't complete; there are yet a few unresolved facts that gnaw at you. Furthermore, the plot is grisly.  A person with the protagonist's problem could be pursuing an entirely different quest.  Which gets me to the last point:  the scenes of violence were more gratuitous than necessary; they didn't strengthen the plot.  If you really like to work hard while watching a movie, or if you enjoy something out of the mainstream, this one's for you.  It's ""out there""."
"Review of Memento : Perhaps since the storytelling technique - unfolding things backwards - didn't knock my proverbial socks off, I'm not terribly impressed with the movie as a whole. I did like it, and it was an enjoyable film, but in its self-imposed restriction of only allowing the audience to know as much as Leonard it becomes victim to that restriction. Some reviews here have mentioned good characterizations, yet I think that despite very good efforts by the performers, there was no room for character development because of the very limits the movie imposes on itself. Its greatest achievement is in leading the audience to believe that what Leonard knows - what Leonard holds as ""certainties"" - are all true.MEMENTO is good, and worth seeing. I just feel that its own narrative rules, clever as they may be, prevent it from the ""fleshing out"" that it seems to need."
"Review of Memento : This movie has been 'sliced and diced' so that it is confusing and hard to follow.  The last five minutes does little to bring this abstract video into focus.  The movies subject matter, dealing with short term memory loss, only made me wish I was suffering from that malady when I left the theatre and could forget the whole flick."
"Review of Memento : I finally watched this after years of hearing how great it is. I've come to the conclusion that the only reason this movie is filmed ""backwards"" so to speak, is because in chronological order it would be even more boring. No action, no suspense, nothing. I get the movie, but I don't get the hype."
"Review of Memento : So many people raved about this movie, some even went as far as to say it was their favorite. IMO This movie was barely twisty; the pay off just wasn't there.By 2021 I have seen mindblowing plot twists, and much more intriguing plots that had me at the edge of my seat. I was no where near the edge of my seat during this movie.Quite frankly, it dragged on and on.In 2000 this movie blew people's minds, apparently. However its repetitive scenes, going backwards (something unique back then) appear to me now, as a way to stretch out an actually VERY simple plot."
"Review of Memento : Perhaps this film's success will signal the transition of film from a medium of words to a medium of pictures, but that doesn't mean i have to approve.  The problem with Memento is that the film shown backwards (ie without the gimmick) would not be watchable.  The plot develops at a slow pace, the dialogue is riddled with ughs, every time Guy says he has a ""disability"" as an example (South Park speaks more intelligently about the topic).  The acting is flat, which i think could be attributed to the filming process during which the actors have said they weren't told much about their roles.  The film is mostly predictible, barring plot twists which seldom make sense due to the backwardity. One thing that this film proves even moreso than The Limey (a better, if average, movie) is that editing counts. Another thing this movie proves, except this time by bad example, MUSIC counts.  The score in Memento is typical pad swells and synth strings, it only hinders a film which would be much more riveting with no music (or perhaps some odd backwards soundscapes). While the directer immerses you in the world of the amnesiac, it's not a world worth inhabiting, as nothing is really happening.  Memento is sort of like throwing a party but spending all your money on the band and not being able to afford invitations.  It's just you sitting alone, enjoying the show of your life (the editing), but wondering why you bothered. 6 of 10"
"Review of Memento : It eludes me how this movie has gotten such high ratings and even two Oscar nominations.This movie is for the most part mind-boggling boring, with endless repetitive sequences of how our main character writes notes, tries to remember certain events or persons. This goes on for about 80% of the movie in an desperate attempt to create ""suspense""...but it gets tiresome. The end admittedly had a moderate surprising twist...however, from a certain point of view, the end was also predictable and, somehow, disappointing. The only positive thing about the movie is a good performance by Carrie Ann Moss, however the main character did not convince me, neither did the plot. (If there was one, besides of a repetitive line-up of the character's confusion and attempts by him to puzzle together memories.) This movie is breathtakingly boring and the ending *extremely* underwhelming. One of the movies which is praised about all over, you watch it - and it turns out a huge disappointment."
"Review of Memento : I can scarcely believe the cult status this film seems to be getting here at the IMDb board. It's a totally enigmatic mess of a nightmare ""from end to beginning"", to coin a phrase based on the fact that the story is told backwards.If it made even one iota of sense to me, it was only toward the end when I had a clue as to what I suspected all along. But even then, nothing was clear and much of the story is unresolved so that you, the viewer, can fill in all the gaps depending on how brilliant and imaginative your mind is.The storytelling technique used here is a tricky one and altogether unsuccessful, in my opinion. As far as I'm concerned, short term memory would be a blessing if only to forget this one entirely. The payoff is zero, as Leonard Maltin has already suggested, and makes watching a film like this a total waste of time.GUY PEARCE does an okay job in the central role but his talent is totally wasted in a script that is as ungrounded in reality as his character is supposed to be. The film itself is all style and no substance, as pretentious and manipulating as any film can be that does not respect its audience.JOE PANTOLIANO and CARRIE-ANNE MOSS are competent but their characters are given coarse language full of expletives that should have been directed at the script they were forced to recite rather than inflicted upon a viewer patiently trying to follow a deliberately incomprehensible storyline. What hurts here, is there is no real solution to the puzzle, leaving the audience just as confused as the central character.What should have been a taut film noir turns out to be nothing more than a cheap shot at manipulation.Apparently, audiences these days are willing to swallow anything that seems unusual or offbeat in its appeal but--even so--there is no way I can account for the sort of comments I see here. Are we watching the same film???"
"Review of Memento : I'd heard a lot of great things about this film before going out to rent it.  But once I did, I must say I was not extremely thrilled with it as the rest of the world seems to be.It is a brilliant and creative idea of how to make a movie (backward revealing of pieces of the story with every new scene) but unless I missed something, I believe that this is all this film had to offer. The acting was good, the story was good, the movie was good... but I do not believe it should be rated the number 1 best indie film and number 10 best film of all time.  (As it is on IMDB while I write this review)I think it simply receives a lot of praise because it is a movie made in a way that no one has ever seen before.  A friend even told me that he thought it was an amazing movie--though he didn't quite totally understand it.  Maybe it is appealing because it is confusing and people view it as a ""smart"" film because they can't quite follow totally what it going on and they have to watch it over and over again.  Either way, I believe it has received much more acclaim than it deserves.  It has certainly won many awards for great editing and original screenplays, etc--which it has.  But a movie of the year--or of all time as some IMDB users are rating it--I totally disagree.Finally, It is indeed totally original in the way a story is told and presented, but it is certainly not the greatest movie of all time.  I was disappointed overall with this film.  I do not believe it is a must-see.I could film an entire movie by attaching a camera to a dogs back and having him film the action, then playing it on the big screen mirrored and upside-down during some scenes.  That would certainly be an original idea never seen by movie-goers before, but that doesn't mean it should be voted into a group with The Godfather or Citizen Kane.I'm not saying Memento is like watching an upside-down film from a dog's point of view... But I'm saying it's up there with the Godfather for reasons that it should NOT be."
"Review of Memento : First of all, this is not a horrible movie.  It does keep you mildly interested.  But it has several, fatal flaws. One reviewer mentioned that the film was too clever by half.  I totally concur.  The film went out of its way to create something unique, and in the process lost the entire narrative structure.  So when it ends, you barely even know if it happened.  In fact, you don't know that it happened.  If Leonard was delusional about Sammy, then perhaps he was delusional about all the characters in the movie.  The fact is, you will never know.The problem is, this doesn't make for a good film.  Good films are those where the narrative art is enhanced by the photography.  By this measure, the movie fails, as the photography does almost nothing to tell the story, and Guy Pearce is as milquetoast a leading man as there is.  The fact is, the film is about trying to put you in his shoes, to show you what Leonard must have felt like living with no memory, but you end up feeling nothing at all because he is such a bland character actor.  I would compare this film in some ways to Se7en--except that Se7en does a much better job telling the story (even if the ending wasn't at all surprising).  The major difference is that you care about what happens to the characters in Se7en.  There is no empathy with Leonard, partly because the film never gives you the chance because it's too busy being clever.Perhaps people will rate it highly, but it is definitely not a Citizen Kane or Casablanca, a movie where you can take it out and watch it over and over again.  It's far too dismal for that.  It's more a movie like Resevoir Dogs, where you like the idea (and perhaps the execution), but the way the story is put together keeps it from being a classic.3/10"
"Review of Memento : Just a deception package! In NO WAY this picture is only half as intelligent as it pretends to be. A quite good idea in deed, but after a promising start it gets  a heavy-handed, mechanical and  predictable bore and a pure letdown, especially because it stays beyond the means. And sorry folks: It really is no achievement to UNDERSTAND this movie -but it sure is to to keep up till the end."
"Review of Memento : Many people seem to consider this to be a brilliant film. Not me. It was a confusing barrage of flash backs, flash forwards, flash whatevers... There were few times when I thought I was beginning to get the drift of what was going on, but that's not how I felt by the end of the film. I believe that the intention of this film is just to mess with your mind, and that was not the sort entertainment that I was looking for when I watched it. Perhaps, at the end of the movie, they hoped I could have empathy with what it must be like to suffer from the memory condition that this guy has, so they tried to create an environment where my brain is turning itself inside out while trying to understand what's going on. Perhaps they succeeded, but I didn't like it and don't recommend it."
"Review of Memento : A very manipulative movie that constantly tries to fool the audience.  It runs in reverse, but only halfway up the story line where everything that went before is called into question.  The director is a David Lynch wannabe, but the expostion is SLOW and BORING."
"Review of Memento : My friends had raved so about this one, I was expecting depth, intricacy, and brilliance.  Instead, this played like a contrived derivation of an old Alfred Hitchcock episode that starred John Forsythe with a dash of Mr. Buddwing and a pinch of Wait Until Dark thrown in for good measure.  # 14 movie of all time !?! -- someone is playing a joke -- right?"
"Review of Memento : In India, one of the top Bollywood super stars Khan  Amir Khan is making a movie. We hear that he is very choosy, selective and does lots of discussion with the Director of the movie before saying YES. So when he said yes to act in a movie everyone got interested and we knew that he is re-making a Tamil version of a movie called Ghajini in Hindi for national release. While reading the story of Ghajini, I remembered that this story is something I have seen. I thought for a while and realized that during one of my International flights I saw a movie (and felt asleep half way) with same story line. So researching on the web  I found that the story on which Ghajini is made is Memento. That is when I decided to give Memento another shot, determined not to sleep this time during the viewing.The story is about a man Leonard (Guy Pearce) whose wife (Jorja Fox) is killed and due to the fight with the killer Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), Leonard looses his short term memory. Leonard remembers every event till his wife was alive, but after that his memory captures only events for 12 seconds maximum. To remember that he has to take revenge for his wife's murder  he has tattooed all over his body the events and facts, and he keeps taking photographs and writes lots of paper notes to remember what he has to do, where he has go etc. That is the way Leonard takes the revenge and kills his wife's killer.It is a typical revenge story. What makes people interested are two things  the concept of 12 seconds memory thrown in and the story is told backwards by the Director Christopher Nolao; meaning the movie starts with the killing of the murderer, and it goes backwards to the scene when wife was killed. This I think is the unique selling point of the movie.The Director must have really spent a huge amount of time and energy in scripting this unique concept. Why one should say the story backwards is a question I still am not able to figure out. For what purpose and sake  just for experimentation, just to show that yes a story can be told in this fashion too? I suppose YES. Earlier we have seen many movies of the same genre where the episodes are juggled and presented to the audience, and only through the last episode the real mystery is uncovered. But does Director Christopher succeed in this experiment? Yes  in getting audience interested in the concept, and yes in getting nominated for Oscars for best scripts and editing.As I told earlier  during the first viewing I fell asleep, because I could not make head or tail of this movie. My second viewing, I forced myself to see it through the 113 minutes. I saw it. As the movie is presented in reverse, I viewed the movie twice in reverse to get hold of the story better. I must have spent about 250 minutes viewing this movie again and again from all possible ways. My verdict is the movie is badly made because: The director even though experiments with a new concept, but fails to hold interest of the audience. All the actors have acted with stoned faced expressions. The love scenes between Guy Pearce and Carrie Anne Moss (another woman Natalie  who helps him) are too irritating, distracting, clichéd and unnecessary for the flow of the movie. The direction  apart from the reverse presentation is very poor.The biggest flaw is that it thinks that the audience is stupid and fool. I could not understand when this hero is not able to remember anything more than 12 seconds how come he figures out that he has kept the notes and photographs in his pockets? Every time he pulls them out  how his memory works then? The story seems to be said lasting two days in total, during which time  he solves the mystery and kills the murderer. What happened between the accident and that two days? How many days have gone by? I saw the movie backwards too. The precision with which he solves the mystery and leads up to the killer is so simple and like child's play  one thing leading to another. The director says that the police don't believe in the hero analysis and thus have not helped him. The efficiency and confidence with which the hero analyzes and corrects his notes is laughable. How he knows what he wrote earlier was false, just because someone has just said the opposite? Could be the person who just gave him the facts  must be telling lies. No questions asked  just a big gimmick by the Director Christopher  who wants to prove a point that he too can make an intelligent movie.But according to me he has failed miserably. I would like to give this movie a zero rating out of 10 just to bring it out of the number 28 slot on IMDb database, but because of this unique concept and attempt I have to give him (Stars 3 out of 10)"
"Review of Memento : Will start this short as can and finish it short as i can! basically in first 10min. of the movie you can see everything. Easily uyou can see who is actually a good,bad or suspicious person that main caracter will deal with. I made sure throughout the movie that it was not possible that the plot was so simple. The main character trolls himself with these photos while the most positive character, officer Teddy, convinces him to listen him and leave town to quit. In short,the whole movie is one big trolling machine because of main character diagnosis. To be clear, the acting is perfect and that was the only thing that kept me watching the movie until the end."
"Review of Memento : I actually understand why the movie is shown in the nature it is, and thought that was an interesting choice in keeping the audience also in the dark, like the character was. Bravo for that, even if it's annoying to the viewer.The problem is that the film is completely one of those pretentious 'ambiguous' believe what you want to movies. You watch in this annoying format hoping to get concrete answers, but never do. The ending, or beginning, depending on how you see it, is completely up to you to figure out. Directors think they are being artistic, but they're being annoying.So yeah, don't bother unless you like to write your own story I guess."
"Review of Memento : Memento started out well, I was enthralled for the first twenty minutes. The next twenty minutes I found ok, the twenty minutes after that I started to get bored and after that I just wanted the film to end.  No I did not get the ending before the end reel but by that time I didn't care, it had turned into a matter of wills, which would break first my will to watch the film or my will to say to a friend that this was the most boring piece of s*** I have seen in ages and could he please turn it off.  The former won, but I felt tha I had wasted two hours of my life which I cannot now get back. If you want a film with a good plot twist watch The Usual Suspects, if you want to watch a film and then be able to say well I'm a real fan watch Memento. Watching Memento and saying it is wonderful isn't a case of watching interlectual film its a case of thinking you are watching a interlectual film, whilst in fact you are watching second rate tat which isn't smart or clever."
"Review of Memento : You see the ending, and then have to wade through the rest of the movie, as it is told in scenes that are presented in reverse order, to see if the ending was a good thing, or a bad thing.  I had that figured out as the opening credits were rolling.  I didn't find the story at all interesting, I knew how it ended, it was just a matter of seeing how we got there... it didn't work for me.Also, I found the guys affliction very odd.  I've never heard of such an extreme memory problem.  I also kept asking myself if a person with this problem could function well enough to leave himself notes, and to tatoo himself with notes, and go on this quest, would he be going around with no one to help him a little... he knows that eventually he will be lost again, except for his notes.  I didn't buy it.  Too odd... too silly."
"Review of Memento : Man am I going to lose some ""artistic"" cred here. The formula is very well done, and totally apt to the condition portrayed by our main character. It is a very interesting story and well told by Nolan and the entire cast. Yes I'm aware of all of that, and based upon all of those things ""Memento"" was brilliant. That being said, I didn't enjoy watching this movie. After being interested for about the first 5 minutes, I lapsed into waiting for the story to progress. It never did. I don't see how anyone could pull off this type of ""pacing"" any better than Momento, the problem is I don't see how the pacing of this story can be good either. It's not the fault of anyone involved, I just couldn't stand constantly receiving the same information over and over. I already know this, I don't care that the main character does not. It could not have been put together any better than it was, but it just kept frustrating me over and over. Every single second of the movie is spent re-hashing information about the movie that the movie has already established. And I don't think that's even possible. The entire film I was thinking ""movie, show me something we don't already know."" And it never did."
"Review of Memento : This was OK, I suppose-but I'm glad I rented it from the library and didn't actually pay money to watch it. It wasn't the worst movie ever, but it just was not very good, in my opinion. Instead of trying to tell a story, the film jumps around with time which can be confusing unless you're paying close attention. I actually thought it was a clever way to go, but they just overdid it to death. By the time it was over, I didn't much care about the plot twist at the end. The jumping around made it less interesting to me.Overall, it was OK I guess, but it lacked something. This was a good idea that could have been a great movie, but it was fumbled. There were holes in the plot and a few things that just didn't make sense to me."
"Review of Memento : The story of two different characters who lose their memory and have no recollection of the previous day each time they wake. Our hero, Pearce, survives by taking notes on the back of polaroids and tatooing important facts on his body. The story is well told and Pearce and the rest of the cast do OK, but basically this is only a 1/2 hour Twilight Zone that would have been better if Rod Sterling had produced it.Save your money and wait until this hits Showtime or HBO."
"Review of Memento : From reading the pretentious reviews here, you'd think that this is going to be a great movie.You'd be wrong.The words ""strange"" and ""weird"" come to mind, but if you want me to say something really nice, all I can think of is that I borrowed the DVD from the library, so it was free.Making this one of the top movies on IMDB is an insult to all the other truly good movies that are on the list.  I gave it a 3."
"Review of Memento : How is this film rated one of the greatest of all time? It boggles the mind! The only good thing about this movie is the acting of Guy Pearce. He gives a terrific performance as the amnesia-stricken lead character. I believe this film is ranked so high because it was completely different than anything anyone had seen before. That being said, just because it was different doesn't mean it was good. I found the film boring and repetitive to the point where I became disinterested. I would not recommend viewing this film unless you are looking for something different. But remember, different isn't always good.My rating : @ 1/2 (out of five)"
"Review of Memento : My take, omg i don't know wtf this movies about. It lost me at the end. What if teddy ended up being the murderer and like the guy he was chasing the cop. May be solve the problem with the non-sequential themes. Harder to read then a frank miller comic book without the rest of the series imho.These are one of those movies that could be good, if they do it right. Is there a book or guide to this movie? The reason why it failed is because in my book the characters got all mixed up. They lost coordination on how to make the movie interesting. If you were to watch 12 monkeys, it would be interesting because the key points, if you watch pulp fiction it would be interesting. This movie would be an interesting comic orientated mobster movie thriller full of suspense or thought provoking if they didn't add sooo many characters. Jesus, who is the guy at the end?!? Why isn't Teddy the killer? I figured the doctor was in his position as an amnesiac, okay. But umm did he just fly into France from Hollywood is my question. The movie is way too thought provoking with too many characters, and some people don't have the time to watch a guy try and remember something until the quarter end of the movie where it takes a back seat in interest. Its as if the user is tricked into actually liking the movie. Horrible. TBH no one would care about a throw in character who is suddenly the killer of his wife, who is now....alive. Whom he kills cus hes an idiot. Okay. Maybe they grew old together. Makes sense, except it would be more interesting if i knew his wife was diabetic, and he kills his wife while in the hospital after the accident. Maybe he could have killed his wife, or maybe he could have had like a son or daughter instead whom he killed. Maybe his wife should have survived and his daughter was the unfortunate casualty. Maybe he went to the town of his killer and made friends with the residence, true...okay but then his killer shows up and the guy he was chasing or chasing him is out of the picture. I would expect even, teddy to actually be lying, while the guy he was chasing be a cop. Sure, throw in the obvious...but what if teddy had a motive to kill him at the end. What if teddy was insured and had him kill the cop, whom he finally realized he killed. What if Teddy was the 'second' guy. Maybe cripple his mind a little psychologically. Was the movie trying to be like funny or something? I don't think so. I like the mood of the film though, it was very light so they went in that direction but i would like to see a light funny comedy thriller with dark humor, very artsy makes you feel really small in a big world. Except this comedy thriller needs murder, it just does..and lots of it. Good idea, not so good outcome. What exactly were they trying to do here is my question. Need's work."
"Review of Memento : Intriguing at first, but no particularly likeable characters, and the twist at the end wasn't worth the wait. It was just repetitive and became so boring that my husband gave up and went to bed. I felt cheated that I'd wasted nearly 2 hours. I can't figure out why it is so overrated."
"Review of Memento : Honestly, what is the reasoning for the story being told in reverse order? Just to be intentionally confusing and pretentious? That's my view on it at least. Although even if the story was told in a comprehensible manner, that wouldn't keep the movie from being a dull slog. This movie makes two hours feel like an eternity.This movie is supposed to be a thriller, but it isn't thrilling. Be prepared to watch the same events happen over and over with a tiny additional sliver of information added every time. It feels like a gimmick and it gets very tiring after a while. It is possible to make a good arthouse film that isn't totally incomprehensible, yet this isn't one of them."
"Review of Memento : Yes, Another MESS of a film starring Guy Pierce (The Man of One Faces). This film is totally predictable and it borrows from 10,000 film plots before it. I'm slowly losing faith in IMDB viewers...to put this anywhere near the Top Ten of 250 films of all time is a total disgrace. This website is slowly losing credibility because of mindless 20 somethings. Don't waste your time on this film. Do laundry or give the dog a bath."
"Review of Memento : I don't know...for some reason I just didn't like this movie. A bunch of my friends had said thati it was really good and messed with your head and everything and came out at a time when I really respected M. Night Shayamalan (he said this was probably one of his favorite films). So I got the DVD and I watched it and was just bored to death. Sure, the acting was okay and the story was good, but the direction just went nowhere and the minutes seemed to drag on.And then there was one thing that really brought it down for me. The ""I don't remember anything before the night my wife died."" If he doesn't remember anything before his wife died, how does he remember that he has a condition. Something that Quentin Tarantino pointed out.This movie just never ticked me with. I found it too slow and too drawn out, like Christopher Nolan was wanting you the get it instead of messing with your head (like the repetitive scenes where Lenny meets the girl and Teddy keeps saying hello). But that's just my opinion and I think you should just judge this movie for yourself like you should judge anything."
"Review of Memento : Best I can do is a 3 and that's because of the acting only. The story is ridiculous. Ok if he did have this condition to where he can only remember 5 or 10 mins at a time since his attack, HOW DOES HE KNOW TO WRITE STUFF DOWN!!!??? Makes zero sense! And the whole tattooing stuff on his body is beyond anything I've ever seen in science fiction. It's a shock or ""cool"" factor, that he tattoos this stuff on his body, so it will give the writers a few mins of dialog in the movie, showing it done and talking about it. And the whole backward thing..... Doing days backwards in time.... No, dumb, idiotic and really adds very little. Yes I understood the movie, the thing I don't understand is how people constantly rate this a 10???? Plus if the guy was really a cop, even a dirty one, would he continue to let this maniac kill people over and over and over? If he did kill all these people wouldn't SOMEONE have turned him in????
Why doesn't he have a tape recorder?????? Maybe I missed it but the first tattoo I'd get is... YOU CAN'T RMEEMBER ANYTHING, PRESS PLAY ON RECORDER! but even then it doesn't make sense because he only remembers 5 or 10 mins at a time. If you wanna watch a good guy pierce movie, watch the count of Monte Cristo or iron man 3. This movie is like a crappy modern art (I know saying crappy modern art is redundant) it's a pretentious load of crap"
"Review of Memento : I just don't know.  I was energized by all the hype for this film.  I found it rather flat and somewhat predictable.  And, I must admit, I fell asleep at least twice - thank God for DVD and I was able to replay it.I understood to a point and agree that going ""backwards"" and challenging the audience is interesting and at least new to me.  However, this would have been better as a comedy - in the vain of ""Groundhog Day"" than it is as a serious piece of film making.Guy Pierce is excellent as the man looking for his wife's killer.  His intensity was about the only reason I was able to get through the film. Good supporting cast as well.Memento is not a ""spectator"" film.  You must watch everything and suspect everything.  Perhaps another time I will rewatch this endeavor and maybe understand it.Good luck to others who are considering seeing this and make sure you are fully awake - watch everything.3/10 for Guy Pierce and supporting cast."
"Review of Memento : Well I liked it. It was very good... errr.... that's it!I mean this movie has been reviewed so many times already, I doubt that anything I say is going to have much impact on you. It was intelligent, compelling and well acted. So what are you waiting for, go rent it!Still here? Well since you're so nosey, let me just add a few more thoughts. This is one of those films that people will tell you is very confusing and difficult to follow. Remember the Usual Suspects? People will go on and on about that film. Heck, there are people out there who found Dune and Mission Impossible confusing. When they finally ""Get"" an intelligent film, these people start evangelising. ""I'm so smart, I got this film, my friend didn't, therefore it must be brilliant!"" And by extension, they must be oh so clever too!Well, I liked the film, I paid attention and got it first time. I haven't rewatched it. Am I some kind of wunderkind? Not by the longest shot. Have I missed some hidden depths? Its about the nature of memory and how we construct ourselves, right? Even in the shallow end of the gene pool we spotted that one.Memento is a wonderful film that rewards attention. The film unfolds its mysteries as you watch. However the real mystery of this film is that the IMDb currently has it rated the 9th all-time greatest film. Its good, but if its in the top 100 I'll eat my hat. To the people who say it took them repeated viewings... PAY A LITTLE MORE FREAKIN' ATTENTION, WHY DON'T YOU? This is not a curate's egg, its an above-average thriller that explores a few interesting themes. Get over yourselves."
"Review of Memento : Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' plays games with the viewer.Nothing new. Nolan has played games with us in nearly all his films. In this film he plays with time; it's as though the story is run backwards; from end to start. Nolan also played with 'backwards' time in the indecipherable 'Tenet'. In 'Interstellar' he flashed his characters into their futures then returned them (in a way) to the present. In 'Dunkirk' three stories run simultaneously; each covering a different period of time. In 'Inception' the viewer never knows for sure if the characters are in a dream. Or reality.The question, for me, is this. Is this gamesmanship merely covering over the fact that these stories are not all that interesting? Scrape away the WAY the story is told and what do you have? In my opinion. Very little (with the exception of 'Dunkirk').'Memento' is an early effort. The plot has enormous holes in it., At least I think it does. I'm qualifying my opinion because, honestly, I might not have 'gotten it'; at least in its entirety. I'm still unsure about how many backward stories there are, and if there are more than one, then why was one of the stories told in black and white? I dunno.I saw it in theaters when it first came out. I didn't 'get it'.Then again - twice more in fact - on broadcast TV: still uncertain.And finally two nights ago - that's four viewings - on HBO Max.Nuh uh.I give up.But don't let that stop you."
"Review of Memento : Memento is one of the most boring unimaginative films that I have ever seen. the fact that a jury a the stardance film fest gave this the Waldo salt screenwriting award, must have Mr. Salt turning in his grave! Loss of memory as a plot device. This is hardly unique and has its origins in a far more compelling film ""Mr. Budwing? staring James Garner circa 1965(?). Also Sidney Lumet's ""The Morning After"" with Jane Fonda and Jeff Bridges also use the same plot device. The manipulation of time device. This is also old hat having been used by, dare I say it Orson Wells in Citizen Kane. And more recently, and far more interestingly, Doug Liman's ""GO"" Steve Soderbergs ""The Limey"" and ok, Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction."" In Memento the use of a time device is quite tedious after the first go round. The pay - off is not worth the wait ""TRUST ME!""Acting UG! the performances by all of the principal cast were soulless to say the least. there was no chemistry between any of the characters. Indeed the only actor who has a soul in this film is on screen far too little Stephen Tobalosky (I know spelling), who turns in a heart wrenching performance that outshines everyone else in the film! In short the film takes its characters and drags us down into a soulless nihilistic pit of slime that is uninteresting, unhelpful and boring! directing More ug! This director better not start believing his own PR or he will out tarantino on the down tic. He has nothing more than pedestrian story telling abilities. He does nothing with his camera that is noteworthy. If he didn't have good DP and a good editor we wouldn't even be talking! screenwriting Waldo Salt would be turning in his grave to learn that this poor excuse for a film was given a screenplay accolade in his name. the first rule of screen story telling is ""Show us don't tell us!""Yet how is the ""film"" resolved? In the last act the Joey P character tells us everything. PLEASE EVEN A BAD BAY WATCH EPISODE could resort to a better means of revealing important story information. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, TRUST ME!"
Review of Memento : I can only imagine the reason this movie hit the top 20 of all time is because the majority of users to this site are under twenty. This is a cult film pure and simple. Did it hold your interests because of the tremendous story line or acting - NO!  The movie is effective simply because the audience is trying to figure out exactly what is going on in a moment of boredom -like trying to solve a crossword puzzle being worked out by the passenger in the next seat when you look over their shoulder. You watch it because it is there and you might as well be somewhat amused while continuing to be bored.Grossly overrated - The ending is a total disappointment. I wished I hadn't wasted my time - and yes I did get the theme.
"Review of Memento : I heard many people say that 'Memento' is an exceptionally brilliant movie which gave inspiration to our own local directors who took the basic concept from it and made a very successful movie here. Now when I see it, I am just wondering how come that it has occupied place in top 250 IMDb rating. May be that I like movies with straight forward story that is gripping and its narration flowing smoothly. It is all as confusing and vague as the mind of the character played by Guy Pierce. It is simply hard to find what he(the lead) did first and what he did later. Whether he commits murder and drives away in car or first drives in and then murders or whether he commits the murder at all. It is taxing on the mind of the viewer to watch the narration going back and forth and it is really tough to keep track of the story line. Many of movies of this director demand certain level of IQ from the viewers to get to his style of narrative. I am very sorry to say that ,but for me, it does not seem worth the time I spent watching this movie."
"Review of Memento : Poor Lenny.  Or is it Leonard he likes to be called?  Dunno.  I've got a short-term memory when it comes to this turkey.  In order to care about a character or situation, I first must feel something for them.  The way Guy Pearce mumbled through his lines, he seemed drugged on downers and quite bored by the whole matter. In order to get my brain working to figure out this patchwork quilted scenario, I first must have some interest in what's going on.  During the period I lasted before fleeing into the night, I didn't care much who killed the wife, why she was killed or, for that matter, how those three kitty-claw scratches got on our doldrum hero's face. Maybe it was his house tom-cat in heat, after all."
"Review of Memento : Oh, please! I don't understand why this has an 8.5 rating attached to it. It's just an average story which is filmed backwards. There's nothing particularly clever or interesting about the plot besides the timeline. People might look at it and think it's deep just because they're confused"
"Review of Memento : Ranked 10th in IMDb 250, the film is overrated! True, there is one clever trick, but what else? Only weak storyline remains. The main character is totally imaginative. The film makers do not really know what those people with ""short-term memory"" actually think. To put those memory in reverse order is way simple and silly."
"Review of Memento : I just watched this movie even though it's been out for 2 decades. I absolutely love thrillers and movies with twists and this movie has been raved about for 20 years. I finally got to watch it and I'm just let down. For the amount of clout it had coming in I had great expectations of a killer twist (aka Oldboy or that type) but it fell short of the surprise. Maybe back then it was shocking but after the fight clubs and other ""it was me"" type movies I left feeling confused and u satisfied."
"Review of Memento : Memento is a film recieving great praise for being a new and highly original idea. While it is original, that doesn't make it a good movie, nor does it make it any fun to sit through. The movie stars Guy Pearce as a man who is looking for the thug who killed is wife. The problem is, he has no short term memory, and has no idea of who his allies are and who is trying to manipulate him. The story is told backwards, with the film beginning at the end, and ending at the start. Unfortunately the novelty wears off after about ten minutes and the film becomes excruciating to sit through, and soon the characters become boring and the plot uninvolving.
Memento reeks of a script that tries too hard to be fresh and original. I must commend this film for avoiding cliche and formula, but at the same time I criticize it for being overly complicated and pretentious when it should have been entertaining. The final word is: Memento is a bust; don't believe the hype."
"Review of Memento : Let me get it out of the way and say that I am a thriller buff. I'm not one of the countless reviewers on this site who watched Memento and didn't understand itI understood the plot perfectlyand I am certainly not one of the countless reviewers who gave this a negative score because they see it as poor cinema. I don't have a pretentious bone in my body.I am writing a negative review of Memento solely because it's exactly like everything I've seen before, and that's something not many people complain about.The main problem I have with the thriller genre is that it repeats itself, in the same way the sci-fi genre repeats itself. When thriller films don't outright copy one another, they always seem to think if they can find some new, original plot they're going to be groundbreaking. The only problem with that last statement is that most thrillers with ""new, original"" plot-lines still simply have the exact same things happening on screen as all the others. The whole wife-is-murdered-I-must-avenger-her plot. Car chases. People talking about the plot. Intense confirmation between bad guy and good guy. You know the drill.While Memento tries very hard to avoid those obvious things, and in the end it somewhat does, it's still nothing you haven't seen before. It plays out exactly like every other thrilleravenge-wife, gather info, kill guy who did itand ends exactly like every other thrillerreversal of expectations. Some of the plot details may be a bit fresh, but when you see the same things that you've seen in every other thriller, who really cares? Memento uses the common mistake thriller writers and directors both make: watching a whole typical movie just to get to the less-typical ending is just boring and forgettable. There is no entertainment value in it. It's the same exact mistake The Usual Suspects made. It's like trying to force yourself to eat a stale long john doughnut just to get to the cream filling. You'll end up throwing the doughnut away.So how great is this ""awesome, unbelievable"" plot twist? Pretty average. It's a plot twist, sure, but with such a pathetic main plot, once again, who really cares they made it a little less pathetic in the last ten minutes? It's still the generic man-must-avenge-wife story.How was the directing? Once again, pretty typical. It just takes some elements of metafiction and puts them on filmso what? Also, the use of black-and-white intertwined is just getting downright cliché, being that most every film with ""amazing directing"" (big emphasis on the quotes) uses it. I will give Christopher Nolan a bit of credit, because he does keep Memento a bit more fast-paced than most thrillers I've seen, but that's about as far as I can say. It still certainly isn't thrilling, and I find that ironic.So what it comes down to is this. If you're a hardcore thriller buff like myself, this is essential for you to see, but that doesn't mean you'll enjoy it. If you're an average movie watcher who just wants something entertaining and smart, look elsewhere. Fast.2/10"
"Review of Memento : This movie is 113 minutes of pure boredom and irritation. The story is frustrating, no empathy is evoked for the main character. The ""oh so revered plot line"" serves as a bore, and makes the viewer extremely impatient. The plot line is stretched far too long and the disappointing ""plot twist"" ending neither does amend nor makes up for the fluff the writers made throughout the movie. This film is like a popcorn bag, which keeps getting bigger and bigger, and then by the end, it pops open, and there is no popcorn inside, just kernels. That is this movie. A bag of kernels."
"Review of Memento : How can ""Memento"" be ranked the 12th film of all-time by IMDB viewers/raters?  I agree that the film is extremly well-crafted, imaginative and stylish - but that does does make it a top-ranked film.Above all, a film must first have a compelling plot/story-line (which ""Momento"" has) but it must be presented in some fashion that the viewer can reasonably hope to understand.  If it doesn't, then the film must convey its message to the viewer through visual and sound impact.  ""Memento"" is only average in the latter approach.Frankly, this movie is just plain incomprehensible and fails miserably because of it.  I tried to understand it, but after awhile one reachs the ""I just don't care about these characters anymore"" point and gives up.  A truly great film must be outstanding in all facets of filmmaking and must be able to communicate its message to the general audience.  ""Memento"" fails on this count.When people rate films (as with any other rating exercise that spans a long time period), they tend to remember and focus only on that which is ""fresh"" in their mind - in this case, recent films while forgetting and failing to keep the current film in proper perspective against the many, many truly great films of the past.While an interesting film, ""Memento"" by no means deserves to be in the IMDB Top 250 films of all time."
"Review of Memento : I may not be the most sophisticated movie critic, but this move made absolutely no sense to my wife or me.  It kept going back and forth in time and was completely confusing.  Its meaning and what was supposed to have happened totally escaped us."
"Review of Memento : I can obviously say that my 2 hours were stolen! If you're kinda fan of action,thriller movies you better stay away from this bs! Im really regret I spent 2 hours watching this !"
"Review of Memento : This movie is sooooo tediouis and starts going in circles in the first 10 minutes. You'll get so sick of his ""condition"" and him explaining it to everybody every few minutes you'll want to scream at the screen for him to Shut Up!! I didn't even care what happened before because what was happening on screen was so monumentally dull. And the tattoo element? Gimme a break man. It's where the whole thing unraveled for me. The whole premise is ridiculous, and if the premise is nonsense how can an interesting movie result? Right, it can't. It's artsy rubbish, and the conversations are absurd, annoying and completely unrealistic. It's not unique or interesting in any way. It's rather simple, actually. The back and forth of black and white and color only adds to the overall feeling of a director who really has no clear vision of where to take his film. I didn't like the constant narration either. This is a below average film, make no mistake about it. The sort of film people congradulate themselves on for figuring out at the coffee house with their ""film afficianado"" buddies. The acting was flatline and lifeless. All praise heaped on this are unwarranted. I can't see what the fuss is about. It's just a typical Hollywood piece of dirt going backwards instead of forward. Not complicated. It's got all the same elements that are dense in a movie that goes in a linear direction. Redundant. Bland. Unbelievable. It's got everything to make a movie fail. I'm so tired of people getting rich and famous by making garbage like this. This sort of averageness should not be rewarded or praised. What a world....."
"Review of Memento : I have absolutely no idea why people rate this movie as highly as they do. Not only is Pearce's acting altogether wooden, the ""try"" level here is so over-the-top and self-conscious it's pathetic: TRYING to be suspenseful, TRYING to be smart, TRYING to keep your attention, but utterly failing at every point. By minute 30 of this sorry film, my mind had already been wandering for 20 minutes. In fact, I didn't even finish this movie. I skipped to the last five minutes, just to see how it would end, and again, found myself yawning. What a boring, self-important piece if there ever was one. Do yourself a favour and skip it."
"Review of Memento : Just a terrible movie and huge waste of time. Sorry to those who love it, but this movie sucked big time. Want a good movie? Watch Prisoners with Jake G (LOL get it?)"
"Review of Memento : This movie is incredibly boring. I wasted 40 mins and finally turned it off. Keeps switching between present (?) and past and you can't figure out what's real and what's not. And you know what, I didn't care. Because it was just not interesting. Didn't care about the characters and didn't care about the plot. My recommendation, don't waste your time.Surely you have better things to do. Like washing the dishes. Lord knows that would be more interesting. I guess this gets such great reviews because it's incomprehensible. So people think it must be great art. Sorry, I don't buy it. It's boring and has nothing important to say about anything."
"Review of Memento : The novelty of this movie is supposed to be the shuffled time-line and slowly revealed plot elements. But, neither improve the mildly lackluster story. Rather, they make it an agonizing waste of time.Movies are meant to entertain, or at the very least, to educate. This snoozer does neither. It seems to me merely an exercise in hipper-than-thou pretentiousness. And, so many of the high-ratings coupled with reviews raving over how artistic and original the approach absolutely confirm this by presuming that anyone who doesn't like Momento is somehow incapable of understanding the complexity. Rubbish (both the movie and the smug reviews). If anything, it is they who are incapable of seeing through the hype to know when they've been duped.Yes, I hung in there for the entire movie... only to wish I'd ditched after the first 10 or 15 minutes when I was first inclined to give up on it. And, yes, I do know the difference between art and pretense.Take my advice. If you reach the same impasse shortly into your viewing, BAIL! I give you my permission. You won't be missing a thing."
"Review of Memento : An empty theatrical experience. A dull movie with no emotional core. Clever editing substitutes for lack of substance and dramatic appeal. Christopher Nolan's failed attempted to invent an original narrative structure.The only intriguing aspect of this glossy Hollywood film disguised as daring indie is the fact it has received accolades from movie critics as well as average movie fans. 'Memento' is so smartly put together that both groups lack the courage to say that the movie is a failure and a bore for fear of not coming out ignorant and unsophisticated.Long ago it was observed by Pauline Keal that art house audience accepts lack of clarity as complexity, accepts clumsiness and confusion as 'ambiguity' and as style. If you thought 'Limey' was pretentious, wait 'til you see this. Or, better yet, don't!Just forget about it!"
"Review of Memento : After all this time, I am still not sure why I hate this movie so much. Perhaps it is because so much undeserved praise was heaped on this pretentious and presumptuous MTV video with aspirations to being a ""serious"" movie. It meanders, sometimes careens, from one gratuitous plot twist to the next, yet in reality very little actually happens. In the end, this is not a bad approach if we are going to get character development instead. Alas, none is here. The characters might as well have had their profiles tattooed on them, like the main character does, because they are no less obvious and devoid of subtlety. Memento confuses plot intricacy for story, of which there is precious little here. Granted the story had to be sparse to further the self-conscious conceit that ties up this formulaic and trite little package with a bow. Now don't get me wrong. Any film that causes us to reconsider what we think we know and to see things in ways to which we are not accustomed is great. But that must not be confused with clumsy subterfuges designed to suggest one thing and mean another. That's just plain silly and cheap, a mindless maze that wanders aimlessly until the author runs out of gas. That's what we have here.Guy Pearce, the Other Australian Actor, is good, reminding me at times of Brad Pitt before he demonstrated so convincingly time and again his epic lack of talent. Unlike Brad, though, Guy is talented. Perhaps too talented for such a claustrophobic little film. And what's up with Joe Pantoliano? Let's see, maybe we can give just him a sandwich board to carry around announcing his ulterior motive in every scene. He is the most typecast actor around, and he could phone in a performance with more mystery and finesse. Still without Guy and Joe, formidable talents in better vehicles, this film would be desolate. Oh, there's lots of little black and white vignettes, and the story is told backwards which has been universally acclaimed as genius, but which, at least for me, smacks of artifice and cliché.Look beyond the gimmickry, and you have a film that aches for a purpose, a theme, a message. What it has instead is a sort of Michael Mann vapidity that even throws in the car and the suit. Holy Don Johnson, Batman.I cannot begin to tell you how over-rated this movie is. It is a favorite of ersatz intellectuals who want to prove their smarts and congratulate themsevles by ""figuring out"" this empty, pointless wankfest of a monumentally overrated movie."
"Review of Memento : Recipe for success in filmaking in the 00's. Write a dyslexic 20 minute short story about a good looking tattoed idiot in a motel room. Shuffle pages, go to Kinkos, make 300 copies, shuffle again, call Tarantino. Rake in the dough.I give this film credit for trying to be different, but the only thing it succeeds in doing is being a monotonous bore. The votes for this dog are proof positive of the near complete dumbing down of this country...either that or just another example of the ""Bandwagon"" Syndrome. Do any of you people really know how to think for yourself anymore? Pitiful."
"Review of Memento : I checked out IMDB to find a good movie to rent.  Saw that 'Momento' was ranked 9 on the all time list.  My wife remembered seeing it at the local store yesterday, so I rushed to get it!As I was reaching for it, a lady next to me said ""it's not that good"".I thought, ""yea right, 16000 IMDB movie reviewers are calling this a top ten of all time movie, and you are saying it's no good...""Well, she was right, and 16000 IMDBers were wrong.  Not really a good movie. Don't believe the hype.  Pass this one up!"
"Review of Memento : Rated 10th best overall by IMDB? There was nothing above average in this movie. A weak plot that unfolds backwards is worse, not fresh, creative, or ground-breaking. If you ranked this movie in your top 10  you probably enjoyed such classics as Lost Highway and Drowning Mona.If you can appreciate an art display consisting of a cage of live chickens running around, this movie is for you. Otherwise, this movie was a sharp stick in the eye. Avoid at all costs."
"Review of Memento : Why didn't this idiot keep an organized journal instead of always shuffling for small pieces of paper and pictures in misc. unorganized places, not to mention different rooms, when he knew he wouldn't remember anything come tomorrow? There was no way he should have been/could have been on the street driving [not knowing where he came from or probably why he was going to point B] let alone seriously be carrying a gun trying to fulfil a vengeance correctly. I'm lucky he didn't point the gun at me. A boring story told in forward so it had to be told sloppily and in reverse as a last ditch effort to be ""intellectually"" interesting. Save your time on this one. And ya, ya, don't bother to tell me about the nuances of it being told in reverse it was just lackluster film."
"Review of Memento : Sigh.Let me first point out the tremendous amount of good in this film.First, Christopher Nolan and young filmmakers like him are to be commended and supported for stretching cinematic conventions and taking chances with the medium. Memento is certainly an important film, a very innovative move from the older flashback structure that has gotten to be somewhat overused. What a refreshing directorial debut, to the point that I think it rivals Orson Welles's famous directorial debut. Kudos to Chris Nolan!Also, there is Guy Pearce. He is outstanding in what must have been an extremely challenging role, and I cannot praise him enough. He succeeds in making us feel sympathetic for a character we never really understand, and that is indeed difficult. To me, this performance is head and shoulders above most if not all lead male performances of the same year.Skip the bad, onto the ugly.Some have tried to give the rest of this film the benefit of the doubt. I cannot. This is another one of those annoying intellectual-exercises-disguised-as-motion-picture a la American Beauty whose popularity I can only ascribe to their sheer complexity. The latter tried to use a complex theme to pass for worth; this one tries a complex structure.Unfortunately, the foundation of a good movie will always be a good, cogent story with strong, well-developed characters (at least in my opinion). Memento has neither. Told forwards, the plot (or non-plot) would be mediocre, even boring. As it is, told backwards, it just makes no sense. I'm not sure it would make sense told regularly. Inventiveness is great, but it is not enough to make a film one of the greatest films of all time (ahem, Citizen Kane). I would put Memento up there with Kane as one of the greatest DIRECTORIAL EFFORTS of all time. But simply put, great direction alone does not equal great film. There are also such things as writing and character, which have been lost in the age of the auteur.I cannot be the first to have noticed the plot's crucial non-sequitor. If the main character couldn't remember anything after the incident, he wouldn't be able to remember that he has a memory problem. However, he constantly tells people this, and it proves to be of central importance to the plot (which is full of other holes). He also has nothing that he would see every morning to remind him. I understand that in real life, this condition does allow you to remember some things, but the film makes it clear that the main character remembers nothing. I'm not merely picking at the film, for this plot hole actually is the plot. And I'm not quite sure how Chris Nolan or anybody involved with the film managed to miss it. Maybe they didn't care? That's likely, because this film does center more around slick direction than great writing.There is a saying that applies: to break the rules, you need to know them. This movie could have been brilliant if Christopher Nolan had taken the time to write a wonderful movie in real time. THEN, had he decided to tell it backwards, the effect, if done right, would have been awesome. However, I left this film just as confused as I was throughout. Even the endless speech at the end that was (I think?) supposed to tie everything up did not help, not to mention the fact that the ""long explanation by an authority"" is a trite, amateur denouement to begin with. It hasn't really worked since Psycho -- which, lord have mercy, is apparently a lesser film than Memento according to IMDB voters -- since the Psycho ending speech was merely tying up loose ends that the audience already knew rather than rewriting the film in seconds like this one does.Frankly, I'm sick of movies that cater either to the box office (Titanic, Gladiator), or critics (American Beauty & now Memento), and somehow end up being branded as great. Movies should be watchable and entertaining, not simply there to win awards so that film nerds can pat each other on the back congratulating their brilliance.If you want writing, character, plot, direction AND complexity, see The Shawshank Redemption or All About Eve. Memento is not the movie for you, and so far its the most overrated movie of the century."
"Review of Memento : Memento is far from an original concept and the plot closely resembles Swiss-cheese. It quite simply does not warrant the praise given it, which I suspect is heavily weighted by the 15-21 male demographic (see Bottle Rocket). The blatant contradictions presented by the sub-standard writing are conveniently covered with mind-numbing violence (as opposed to that which is stimulating, thereby justifying the waste of 90 minutes of my life). Ooh! I have no memory; it must be a ""condition""!If you don't get it because it is so ""mind-blowing"", wait until you grow up and understand that being confused by the story doesn't indicate clever writing. I can't stress enough, SAVE YOUR VOTE UNTIL PUBERTY IS OVER! At the very least, commit to a second viewing before casting! It is simply embarrassing to indicate that this movie is rated as #9 by US voting standards (what are the French going to think?). It is going to lower the standards of movies being produced worldwide!Resist the temptation to fall into the pit of hype! Watch Groundhog Day instead."
"Review of Memento : You must first ask yourself: Is the story good enough to be run from beginning to end? I say no. So everyone who gives this movie a ten clearly fell for the gimmick of starting the movie at the end. I challenge...no I beg...anyone please, PLEASE tell me why this movie ranks where it does. Funny thing is, I don't know anyone who likes this film either. Do you really care for any of the characters?? Whatever happened to good old fashioned storytelling?? Liking this movie is almost considered trendy, and please, all the elitists, save your breath...I get it. You don't have to be a genius. As a whole this movie is awful. 1 out of 10."
"Review of Memento : The story changes track every 5 minutes, and is a torture to watch. I can appreciate if short term continuity is not an issue to come up with novel plot that you want to cram into one movie as much as possible, the whole movie would turn into something like - this !But honestly, you have to ask yourself, are the characters in this movie worth that much attention ? To me, they weren't. There're nothing likable about any of the characters that spurred me to find out the ""truth"" about their situations. So overall, it became like who cares after about the first 20 minutes, and no, I don't want to see this movie three or four times just to understand what's going on.So the movie is just a novelty, and I doubt that it will be remembered as any kind of a ground breaking masterpiece even if the ratings are high. How many people can honestly say that they went to see this movie four or five times at a theater ? I bet none. If I paid $10, I expect to be entertained in the first viewing, not shown some self indulgence of the screen writer that I have to sift through the mess to understand what's going on. You work for us, not the other way around.Please take it back, and you can keep it."
"Review of Memento : I had heard all the raves. A reviewer said ""you'll want to watch this movie several times because it's so complex"". I really wanted to see it... Then I did. My wife gave up after less than half of it. I forced myself to see it through, because I hoped there was something to redeem it. Well, there wasn't. Complex? Nothing worthwile is revealed after the first half, actually, the thing is pretty much clear after the first scene - never mind the sordid detail revealed later, doen't add anything for me. An uninteresting, unbelievable, unappealing story acted out by characters one cannot get oneself to care for. So it's told backwards, big deal. I've seen similar things before, done much better. No short term memory? Try ""Winter Sleepers"", that idea is used there much better. Acting? The characters had to look bewildered and smarmy, in turns. Not a great range, in my opinion. My conclusions: don't bother with this one!"
Review of Memento : Don't be seduced by the f***wits. This is your basic pretty-boy hollywood tripe (poorly) disguised as an indie.There's also clearly some scam here to artifically inflate the votes attributed to this film - no way does this deserve the reviews it's so far got. Outrageous.
"Review of Memento : I watched this film based on its number ten ranking.  I will never make that mistake again!  I cannot believe that so many people have been taken in by a movie that is based on nothing more than a gimmick.  There is not a single character in this film that I give a damn about, one way or another.  P. T. Barnum said, years ago, that a sucker is born every minute.  The number ten ranking of this movie proves that nothing has changed."
"Review of Memento : I've watched this movie a few times in a vain attempt to like it. Each time it actually became harder and harder to get through it.It's doing the ""Pulp Fiction"" thing in the course it runs....yes I get it. I understand what's going on, but just because I understand it doesn't mean i'm going to like it. Pulp Fiction at least could string its ""backward"" story together coherently and every single character was interesting and ""human"". Dull, dull characters, and a snoozing and an increasingly boring plot line suck any joy that you might be looking to get while viewing this trash. (I understand the concept of drama, or even a good ""who done it?"" but for god sake do it correctly!) Unlikable characters and certainly none that you can relate to. The only remote bright spot I found with this movie was the performance of Joe Pantoliano and he couldn't even salvage this wreck. Pretty sad when a supporting character injects more interest in your movie than any of your main ones! The continuity (yes even is reverse) constantly contradicts itself, and is so much more over complicated than need be, that you just say ""oh the hell with it"" about halfway through...that is if you haven't fallen asleep yet. I honestly am dumbfounded as to why this movie is so popular, and even more baffled as to what it's doing on the IMDb's top 250. The only thing I can figure is either a lot of people will vote ""10"" on anything that Christopher Nolan does; anything that could be considered ""alternative or indie"" or that there's a trend occurring that anything that might be different from your standard movie ""must be cool."" Thank goodness Nolan redeemed himself with ""Batman Begins"" & ""The Dark Knight"" or I would seriously consider boycotting his future work.Absolute garbage abound with lousy writing, unconvincing and lousy acting and unengaging dull characters (except Pantoliano). Save yourself two hours of your life and see something else instead."
"Review of Memento : I use these ratings all the time and have found them to be pretty much spot-on how I end up regarding different films...but THIS...I'm not wondering about the movie as so many have commented, I'm wondering about the other reviews. THAT'S what just doesn't add up.You know how Quentin Tarantino creates all those scenes that gen X think are awesome, but are just physics challenged? You know the world doesn't work like that, and there's no plot reason to violate the laws of physics, but Quentin thought it would be neat and his sheep think so too? This is the social relationship version of that kind of...being reality challenged.The temporal order in which events are presented is absolute nonsense. He doesn't remember things that way, so why would you present it that way just to...look cool? Is that what it's supposed to be? I'm a neurologist and can tell you that the portrayal of his condition is also quite reality challenged. Where are the police? It's the kind of totally self indulgent gen X rubbish where ""nothing exists outside my head"" and ""I dream that I am a..., so I am"" that drives Boomers insane. THAT'S the real plot reason, I think, for his condition. It allows for the a priori decision to do this from a POV view that is, well quite frankly, produced by managing to insert one's head far up one's rectum. The jokes aren't even funny. This movie scares me. It scares me that there is a whole population of people that can identify with what the screen writer and director were trying to do. A lot of the glowing reviews are the only one written by the author, so there could be a good deal of ""paid buzz"" generation going on here as well. Bottom line, if you actually liked Kill Bill or Blair Witch, you will probably find this awesome. If Pulp Fiction made you want to go out and take a cattle prod to the first gen X you could grab, then you'll hate this.Very sad that I will no longer be able to trust IMDb ratings any more, but when complete and utter rubbish gets an 8.5... Sigh. And relax the spell check restrictions. ""T-o-s-h"" is a perfectly good English word and it is spelled correctly."
"Review of Memento : If you are a studious fan of film and film history, this movie is nothing but a curio destined for a dusty shelf.  Maybe the project started as a handful of good ideas, but the result will be as short lived as short term memory (assuming you have such).  It's nifty occasionally, but mostly vapid and pointless. With a style that wears as tedious as the suit the main character wears over and over, the story is mundane with acting stilted and amateurish.This is 21st century Hollywood Hokum with no subtlety, amusement, suspense or real viewing satisfaction.  Not only is it not the 10th best film ever, it is not the 1000th best."
"Review of Memento : As I write this, Memento is listed as number 10 on IMDb's top 250. It is ahead of Apocalypse Now, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Dr. Strangelove, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Lawrence of Arabia, The Graduate, Raging Bull, The Sting, The Empire Strikes Back, The Wizard of Oz, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Deer Hunter, Gone With the Wind, every Hitchcock movie, every Woody Allen movie, and every Kurosawa movie, except Seven Samurai, just to name a few.To hear the people on this board tell it, Memento is the 21st century's Godfather or Citizen Kane. I rented this film because of all the high praise it received. What I was treated to was an average film with only one outstanding performance (Joe Pantoliano), enough plot holes to drive a Jaguar through, and a gigantic gimmick that is as essential to the film as the shark is to Jaws.The movie is chopped into a number of scenes and shown in reverse. If one were to re-edit the film and show it front to back, it would be devoid of suspense. All the ""cerebral puzzles"" etc. would be gone. Even in its weird order, it's not all that deep. The director uses the sequencing and the protagonists's disorder to keep the viewer guessing. It's all a big trick, and by the end, the viewer is just relieved that it is over.There may be real people who suffer from this inability to create new memories, but I highly doubt they are able to function effectively as Pearce's character did. Nor do they have a network of friends who help them function and fail to get them professional help, especially when they are on a homicidal vendetta.Do not waste your time here. This movie has been rated highly by a bunch of people who mistake directorial sleight of hand for real movie magic. Rent any of the films I mentioned in the first paragraph. They actually deserve their praise."
Review of Memento : I really hate to discredit art when credit is due. But in the case of memento if you like to watch a barrage of continuously replayed and ominously boring clips and a truly not so thrilling movie with a has been leading actor who would sadly do better on a lifetime movie rather than this. This is sad to see what is becoming of America or rather the world when this kind of a movie gets such a good rating. This movie was a blundering piece of reverse psychology that a 6 month old child could have guessed from the beginning. However if you feel like watching an almost 2 hour movie with only 45 minutes of film love going from color to black and white with no intentional purpose and like to feel like your mind is stuck in an ipod shuffle with bad 80s music for what feels like hours be my guest and watch this boring pile of garbage just remember i told you so.
"Review of Memento : As for the story: throw in the usual wrongfully deceased wife/daughter. Add a formula, like memory loss, also a proved recipe. Now throw in a little gimmick, lets write it backwards in time, or half of it forward and printed backwards so you need to read it using a mirror.. Something like that. Great idea! Really, after I managed to recompose the story from its fragments, all I had was an incredibly thin story. With entirely one- dimensional characters, all equally unlikeable. This one I can spoil in a single line. Guy suffers from memory loss from a head injury, and tries to get revenge, but is used time after time because of his memory loss. Give or take a handful of unimportant and uninteresting details. Top ten movie? Apparently people can be bought cheaply, and they take chaos for complexity when given the chance."
"Review of Memento : I saw this film after hearing all the hype while on my last trip back to the States. It turns out that it's much ado about nothing. I was not impressed. In fact, I was almost depressed that something so evidently sub-par was being touted as nothing short of a revelation.So what if the film has an unusual non-linear narrative structure??? So what if it's stylish, hip and has great cinematography? I don't care for the characters one bit! They're pure cardboard, impossible to relate to, sketchy at best - even Guy Pearce's character. They exist solely as pegs for a context which is not all that interesting in and of itself - in fact, it's downright pedestrian. A guy's wife is raped and killed and he goes after the killer when he wakes up - how many times has that one been used? The whole thing is contrived and stinks of an exercise - it's just soulless mental masturbation, and anyone getting off on it is really selling themselves short! Even the much-talked about backwards narrative structure isn't all that new. It's been done before in a film by David Hugh Jones called BETRAYAL, with Jeremy Irons, Patricia Hodge and Ben Kingsley. Even though the story is quite different from this film, BETRAYAL has everything this film lacks - strong characterizations and people that you actually care about. In BETRAYAL, you anxiously await the next flashback because you are genuinely concerned about the characters' fate. MEMENTO, with each flashback, just gets more and more annoying. It WAS slightly intriguing to see Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss (refugees from THE MATRIX) in this together, as it is another play on ""What is really real?"" but this is hardly a benefit. However, I don't blame the actors one bit - they were just not given much to work with.Incidentally, Guy Pearce IS someone to watch. It'd be interesting to see him and Brad Pitt together in a film - they'd be very believable as brothers."
"Review of Memento : If more movies were made like this, Memento, with its empty story-line and cute direction, would be seen more easily for what it is: mind-numbingly pedestrian schlock.  Pearce does well, but this movie annoyingly and shallowly overworks a fascinating premise, as most con jobs do."
"Review of Memento : Although people may view this as a stupid comment.The entire film is based on a gimmick,yes,there i said it people i mean its basically a simple story done countless times before.A guy is exacting revenge on his enemies for murdering his wife so obviously in the filmmakers mind they had to come up with a cheap gimmick to throw off the viewer and they use this backwards gimmick nonsense that really makes no sense when you look at it by making the main protagonist in the film,a man with short term memory loss who writes on himself,oh how weird is that.The film has average acting,mediocre cinematography but nothing else going for it except a simple story wrapped in a convoluted wannabe virtuoso type film-making.I mean Christopher Nolan is a great director but this is not an outstanding debut like M Night SHyamalan's The Sixth Sense which had a great story,a superb twist and larger than life characters,a scary movie with doses of romance and the physchological horror.Nolan basically rips off Tarantino here with the chronology type film-making.I'm sure some other filmmaker one day will film a similar story like this sideways or some nonsense and it becomes a sensation like the overrated Memento.Besides IMDb rating sucks anyway.This movie would be forgotten eventually"
"Review of Memento : Yeah I remember seeing ""Memento"", when it was called ""Clean Slate"". murder mystery solved by a man with amnesia. And the backwards idea was stolen from a later episode of ""Seinfeld"". This movie was terrible. The ending was the worst I have seen in recent years. Can't Hollywood come up with any new ideas? I've heard it was an ""indie"" film, but I would expect more from an independent label."
"Review of Memento : The praise that I usually hear about this movie is that it ""makes you think"" or ""is really confusing, and that's cool"".  What's frustrating to me about it's continued popularity is that while it does have a cool idea, it ends up more like a parlor game than a good film.  Sure, it is cool trying to piece together the story, trying to remember what happened in the last scene, and trying to figure out who thekiller is.  But the movie is ultimately unsatisfying.  The characters are flat, emotionless, and none of them sympathetic.  The editing is great, it is in fact the saving grace of the movie, but the directing is stale, boring and cold. Nolan doesn't get anything near good performances out of his actors.  They seem tounderstand what works about this movie, but never perform in a way that moves you (with the exception of Joe Pantoliano, who is convincingly evil, but notgreat) The movie is sterile.  It has no power over the audience.  The story is ultimately uninteresting.  Just because a movie engages you mentally doesn't mean it is a good film.  Sure it makes you think.  It makes you think alot.  But so does a calculus test."
"Review of Memento : Ha, Indian have copied this movie in Hindi namely Gajni. Their plot was very much altered and commercialized with the two stories side by side,one the chase of murderer of his girl friend and second the story of his past being read by a helpful woman on his personal diary.The movie was major hit and idea of short term memory loss was new to Indian and Pakistani viewers.The original plot is very much difficult, in my point of view. The upward and backward sequence is complicated technique. Some specific characteristics after the murder of his wife, should be more vivid such as combats, power and glimpse of previous life. The movie could be more than a novel translated into a reel."
"Review of Memento : This movie took a totally original backwards style and made it amazing. This movie really screws with your head. You never find out who John G. really is. This is just such a confusing movie which leaves many unanswered questions in your head, but it keeps you thinking throughout and that's better than laughing at some stupid comedy. This is a totally original and amazing movie that really confuses you all the way as to what is going on, but you really should not miss it!"
"Review of Memento : I earlier commented on the mood and the score of ""Memento,"" which evoked other California psychological dramas/thrillers like ""Heat"" and ""Safe."" After seeing it again and looking at recent reactions to the film, I can say that Memento isn't the 9th best film ever made.  What it is becoming is a little hope to movielovers who are losing faith in theaters. They had 80 movies at Sundance, and only 8 of them found distribution. Even Memento, the Grand Prize winner, can only make it into 450 some theaters in the country, (despite having the fourth highest amount of money per location in the States according to Philadelphia Inquirer stats.) Meanwhile, at Cannes, Miramax picked up two films out of all the competitors, and the Palme D'or winner, ""The Son's Room,"" was left behind by U.S. companies.  (Last year ""Dancer In the Dark"" won this award.)    Harvey Weinstein explained the American art market is saturated, but it's saturated because we've stopped putting really edgy stuff into the art theaters...now even the ART theaters have to have commercially viable material, because our multiplex-dominated theater landscape is rejecting anything but the simplest stuff, never mind foreign films.  Box office stats are like Scripture these days: they allow guys like Bruckheimer to claim that 75 million on Pearl Harbor's opening weekend revealed the quality of the film/audience response to it.  All the opening gross for the first few days ever indicates is the quality and level of the hype for the movie in the days before it opened.  Variety doesn't even necessarily come with a 24-theater multiplex- it just means they'll show Star Wars Episode II on 5 screens, in half-hour intervals, leaving the struggling films aside.
   I bring this up because Memento is a perfect case of a really good movie that SHOULD be making box office records but has been ignored because of a little complexity and no megastar power.  People are saying it reminds them of the Sixth Sense.  Sorry, but without that ending and the performance of Haley Joel Osment, The Sixth Sense is not nearly as well-made a film as this.  Christopher Nolan's directing abilities, the writing, and the performances of his cast distinguish this film as a more than a trick-ending thriller.
  I agree the ending is misleading and confusing.  However, (SPOILER) it's not Teddy's words that make the ending powerful- it's seeing Lenny deceive himself, destroy photographs of himself, and create another hunt, lying to himself to be happy.  Maybe Teddy is the culprit, but the point is that Lenny MAKES him into John G., creates and destroys evidence where he pleases, making his records totally subjective and unreliable, despite his claims to the contrary.
  Maybe it's got a gimmick.  Maybe us reviewers are taking it too far, but I for one enjoy a movie that plays with our intelligence instead of just hitting us over the head with effects or pathos.  If this movie were #1 at the box office, I would likewise get tired of the hype, but instead it's being denied a chance to reach the majority of people.  Nolan and Pearce have made probably the best film of the spring, and not enough people are getting the opportunity to see it because of theaters eager to show the pre-determined ""blockbusters.""  I know it's only a movie, but given the general decline, and current lack of faith, within major theaters, Memento is a breath of fresh air."
"Review of Memento : SPOILER ALERTHow did Lenny know how to get to the bar where Natalie worked??  Yes, he received the coaster from Teddy, but that was AFTER the bar incident in front of Natalie's house inside the jaguar car.If the movie was TRULY running backwards, Lenny should have been in the bar FIRST, before Lenny received the coaster from Teddy telling him to meet Natalie in the Jag.So the movie did not run backwards throughout.**Remember Penelope**"
"Review of Memento : Many people have found Memento frustrating, and I can see why.  After concentrating so hard on keeping up with the action and being convinced that you are being led back to an explosive finale, you just end up with Guy Pearce saying ""now, where was I?"" and you realise that you've been concentrating so hard on absolutely nothing.  I, however, thought that this movie was absolute genius.Director Christopher Nolan uses a post-Tarantino style narrative, moving the story backwards.  It's good to see some new styles of narrative as opposed to the 'Pulp Fiction' style with stories all interlinking towards the conclusion.  Not only does the storytelling style impress, but it also puts the viewer right into the head of Leonard Shelby.  Yes, it's frustrating - but Nolan is just trying to convey to you how frustrating it is for Shelby, and he has chosen the best possible way of doing it.The three protagonist performances from Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are good.  Pantoliano and Moss in particular are superb in convincing the audience that they're something what they are not.  However, the real superstar in the film is Christopher Nolan's outstanding direction and script.  He never tells the audience too much to make the film boring, but he also never tells too little to keep the audience guessing.  There are so many 'blink and you'll miss it' moments (keep an eye out for Sammy Jankis sitting in the residential home) that you cannot absorb everything necessary in one viewing.  What Nolan has successfully done is keep the audience in the palm of his hand and thrown them into the head of Leonard Shelby.  And I loved every minute of it.**********"
"Review of Memento : The basic story of this film seems straightforward enough; a man is attempting to avenge the murder of his wife despite being unable to recall any subsequent events.  However, instead of presenting the events in sequence, the makers of this film present them as snippets, in random and sometimes repetitious sequence, a bit like playing the tracks of a CD in random, rather than sequential order.  The result, to me, was just too self-consciously clever, and also, simply incredibly boring.  I found myself wondering more than once if I should simply walk out of the theatre and put myself out of my misery.I know many people who have seen the film found it fascinating, challenging, and the like, but I simply feel that the emperor is not wearing any clothes."
"Review of Memento : *Memento*The Academy has gone crazy.  I am sure we all know that by now.  Last year they gave the covetted best picture award to Gladiator when we all know the best film was Almost Famous, wich didn't even get a nomination.  This year the same thing happened.  A beautiful Mind won best picture when we all know Memento should have because not only was it more original and entertaining, it was also very clever and well written (best original screenplay anyone?). But I guess I shouldn't care so much, after all we all know the Oscars nowadays only give the award to the movie that was most hyped.Memento deserves all the hype of A Beautiful Mind and more.  There wasn't a dull moment.  Guy Pearce gives an excellent performace (that the Academy overlooked) as a man without a memory.  The story goes backwards wich is incredibly clever and instantly draws you.  As you get farther and farther into the movie it starts to unfold and make sence and even before the end you realize this is a wonderful film!  And as for the surprise end, or beginning... well I suggest you see it to find out for yourself.*10/10*"
"Review of Memento : I work in a video store.  I assure you that watching as many movies as I do, you begin to tire of repeatedly seeing the same contrived, trite, unoriginal, uninspired films.  Memento was none of these.  Memento was perhaps one of the greatest movies I've ever seen (right next to Pi, Requiem for a Dream, Fight Club, Dreamscape, Pitch Black...etc).  I recommend it to EVERY single person that asks me ""what's a good movie?"", and I get that question a LOT.  Memento was certainly inspired by other movies, that's true, but it added new elements and cinematography that it's predecessors did not have.  Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano come together again after doing the Matrix and they both deliver stellar performances.  Guy Pearce however, was absolutely phenomenal, he was great in ""Rules of Engagement"" and most triumphant in ""Ravenous""...he's slowly becoming one of my favorite actors.  So if you're ever thinking to yourself, ""what's a good movie"" make sure, at least once, to answer with ""MEMENTO""."
"Review of Memento : ""MEMENTO"" had to win the best screenplay written directly for the screen in this year's Academy Awards. This is the kind of movie that will make you think, it will keep you wondering, but for sure,  it will not bore you -unless you don't take it seriously-. The characters of the movie are developed greatly, and the actors who portray them are perfect. The direction of the movie is great too, but if you blink maybe you'll get lost in some parts. ""MEMENTO"" is a flawless movie, it's perfect in all senses, it's watchable for thriller and mystery fans. A MUST SEE!!!!!!! 10/10"
"Review of Memento : I don't like film noir for the same reason I don't like modern art.  Modern art is cool because it is incomprehensible, providing the illusion that indulging confusion is somehow deep.  I've always thought this sort of thing was a kind of joke where the artist laughs quietly at our efforts to inject chaos with false genius.  Or maybe I just don't get it.To be incomprehensible because of intellectual prowess may be admirable, but to be incomprehensible due to little more than obscure confusion is annoying.The problem with this film is that the plot is simply not resolved.  Whether or not this is intentional, I honestly cannot tell.  We are given an explanation in the penultimate scene that is presented in a manner that simply invites us to ask more questions which ultimately go unanswered and leaves the audience to make up their own mind.  If possible.Honestly, this little trick was old a long time ago and has not become less annoying with age.I will say, however, that the film is captivating.  I desperately wanted my answers and enjoyed the highly experimental sequencing.  But the director owes me an answer.  He owes me a story.  He owes me a conclusion. 
And we never get one.  Or maybe I just don't get it.  If you want something that's different and kind of cool in the end, watch The Sixth Sense or Fight Club.  You won't lose sleep trying to figure them out because they actually have a conclusion."
"Review of Memento : I'd say Memento was interesting in concept but strangely devoid of empathy for its characters. Film Noir usually deals with characters who are hard to have sympathy for but this film seems colder than most. Compare Leonard with the car salesman played by William H. Macy in Fargo. That character planned and perpetrated a terrible crime but because the script and Macy's performance gave us a full portrait of the man and his weaknesses and situation, we could have actual feeling for him. I couldn't really feel for Leonard much less for any of the other characters. Interestingly, for a film that runs backwards, certain aspects of the development of the characters still ran true to the conceits of regular movie story arcs. The first (ie: last) scene with Natalie the barmaid has her being very sympathetic to Leonard. Later on (I mean ""earlier"") in the story, Natalie lets out (spoiler alert) with a lot of venom toward Leonard that would be appropriate during the last third of a normal movie-except that at this point she has only just met him. Since female characters in movies invariably start out by hating the guy, then liking him, then getting mad at him, then forgiving him again, having a female character go through these changes backwards doesn't really break any new ground, does it?"
"Review of Memento : This movie had a great plot, and great design.  Especially when they decided to do everything backwards.  (applauds) to Christopher Nolan, for becoming a great director, but do you have more of these, since your brother is the one who wrote the script from a short story?  I think not, I expect Christopher Nolan to fall flat on his face after this movie.  I may be wrong, but we'll see.  If you want to see better movies, watch some David Lynch flicks, like Mulholland Drive.  great flick."
"Review of Memento : How real are our memories? Good or bad, they make our decisions, and when you think about it, they are what a life adds up to. But how real are you when you can't have new ones? When your last is always the same? In this heartbreaking film from writer~director Christopher Nolan, that's the problem in Leonard Shelby's day.As Leonard Shelby looks for the pieces of his life, you begin to think about how yours fit togeather. Which ones are real? Which were made to help you get by? You thought that his journey would just be interesting, but it makes you think about how real your own is.Sometimes you remember things that meant something, and try to hang onto them. Leonard barely has the best memories of his murdered wife to keep him company. When he closes his eyes, to keep them all togeather, it's one of those movie moments where you understand that it came from the writer's memory, a place that you can only see, and can't describe~those wonderful moments where your life happens. What if you had to remember them to keep going?You may be surprised by Leonard's journey, but it is the story of a man who does what he thinks is right. And only has his memories to keep him happy."
"Review of Memento : I was just wondering...was Lenny partially a bad guy? I mean after he killed that drug guy and was sitting in his truck writing 'Don't believe his lies' on the back of Teddy's picture, he was saying things in his head like: 'Do I lie to myself to make me feel better? In your case Teddy, I will.' as well as: 'You're a John G. so you could be MY John G.'I am just curious if he could be sort of a bad guy in a way. Since this basically means that he is gonna kill Joe Pantaliano's character when he doesn't deserve to die."
"Review of Memento : **SPOILER** Caution, don't read 'till you have seen the movie.Does Natalie feels sorry for Leonard and help him out? I don't think so. She is using him just like Teddy did. When Leonard copies down the license plate. He puts a number ""1"" down for the second to the last digit. When he goes to put the tat on his body, he misreads his own writing and turns it into a letter ""I"". The movie shows the license plate both ways. First with the one when he writes it down, then with the capital letter ""I"" after he gets the tattoo. Leonard gives Natalie the wrong license plate to look up. It doesn't matter to her because she knows ""Teddy"" is the cop that had her boyfriend killed. (Remember, the cop visited her bar before Leonard showed up in her boyfriends car and suit.) She makes up a bogus set of paperwork showing that ""Teddy's"" real name is the same as the killer. She is using Leonard by tricking him into doing her dirty work for her. The license plate thing is also an illustration about how our memories, even with note taking, can play tricks on us. All the above reviews are right about one thing, this movie gives you a lot to chew on for days afterward."
"Review of Memento : The most original movie I had ever witnessed. Well along with the movie Angel Heart which is the bomb.com. I won't give anything away either. What more can I say? It sure as hell deserved its rating. Its just as simple as the summary about a man who after a tragic incident involving the rape and murder of his wife suffers from amnesia and uses notes in the form of tattoos on his body to remember and to hopefully avenge the murder of his wife. I'm sure someone has a better summary.The fascination with this movie is how it affects you as you watch it unfold revealing itself and how it makes you feel afterwards. Then you come out with different opinions to the ending. Amazing.There are a limited number of movies that can affect you like this. Its rare nowadays that you can still spook and boggle the minds of today's audiences. This movie confused me at first, yet I felt spooked and then after a second viewing the story unfolded right before my eyes, it scared the sh*t out of me. I was horrified. And when I say horrified, I'm literally horrified for people who actually  suffer from this form of illness. Fine performances by everyone and the script was off the hook."
"Review of Memento : The action and quirky wierdness of ""The Usual Suspects"" with the action (but not so bloody) and interesting dialog of ""Pulp Fiction.""  Where Pulp Fiction had two buddys sharing odd conversation topics throughout, Lenny, in Memento, just talks to himself.I knew a guy who hated Pulp Fiction because he couldn't follow the plot. You know, the way the end is at the beginning?  If that's you, then don't waste your time on this film.Yes, the story is told in a very odd way.  If you can handle it, don't ask any more, just GO SEE IT.  I don't feel compelled, as some people do, to tell you exactly how the story unfolds.  Figuring that out is half the fun of this movie.I promise you, you'll be THINKING ABOUT IT FOR DAYS after you see it.  All the questions raised in the film are answered, but they're not easy.  It'll take a few minutes to a few days to settle your brain over it.  The word ""profound"" comes to mind.  Not many movies do that.  This movie is like peanut butter stuck to the roof of your brain.Enjoy"
"Review of Memento : This film was simply amazing, what a wild ride from beginning to end. At first, my reaction was one of, ""what the f*** is going on?"" but gradually, that changed as more and more fell into place. I reccomend this film, without a doubt.Oh, and Kate Janisch is the coolest person...Ever."
"Review of Memento : To quote the great Keanu Reeves:  ""Whoa"".  Give yourself over to this hypnotic, challenging movie and you'll have a great ride.  Try too hard to figure it out or second guess it, you'll ruin the fun of watching a truly original work unfold.  It's so great to see Guy Pearce in another good role since LA CONFIDENTIAL.  Joe Pantaliono is reliable as always.  And even though the story is told backwards, it still manages to surprise you.  A clever film that doesn't sacrifice the humanity at the heart of the film for cheap shocks, this movie is more than a mere gimmick.  Pearce will truly make you care about this character, rooting for what essentially boils down to a revenge fantasy.  You could poke holes in it all night long, but why bother?  Just lean back and enjoy one of the best mindf***s captured on film."
"Review of Memento : Hi everyone, fans of Memento! I love this movie, and I've watch it a lot of times, but I still have a little problem: I'm from Spain, my English is far from perfect, and I can't understand why Lenny calls Teddy after beating Dodd. I mean, I know he calls him because he sees the name written down in the paper he's carrying in his pocket. But, here comes my problem: what mean ""put him onto Teddy""? I don't know, the Spanish translation gives something like ""ask for Teddy"" (""preguntar por Tedddy""), but is this the real meaning of the sentence? Can anyone please give me an explanation of the meaning of ""put him onto Teddy""?(thanks in advance, sorry for my awful English)"
"Review of Memento : Major spoilers ahead, so honestly, don't read this if you haven't seen the movie. First, I'd like to say that I truly appreciate modern movies with decently unexpected endings.  Not forced 'surprise' endings, but movies that really turn out to not go in the direction in which you expected them to go. Memento is a movie about personal motivation, the desirability of truth, and justice. It's conclusion was startling to me... that the first of that list of three significantly overrides the other two, at least for a man constantly in a prelusive state.  The only way that Lenny could give his life any meaning at all, the only way he could preserve his life, is by ensuring that he constantly had an objective that he could systemically strive for. Thus he invented John G., and made his  existence a pursuit of him. Another interesting conclusion of this movie is that this man is constantly going around killing people, and even though he doesn't realize it, he is responsible for their deaths.  He may not at every moment be aware that the man he is pursuing is innocent of that which he accuses him, yet at the point where he made that decision he was aware of it.  He is, then, completely responsible, and should, if ever caught, spend the rest of his life living a three-minute jail sentence."
"Review of Memento : I've been hearing the buzz on Memento for some time now.  Unfortunately, it wasn't being shown in Phoenix (I don't understand why no one wants to pick this up for a mainstream release!) so a friend of mine and myself decided to drive to LA this weekend just to see it. And guess what, the movie was worth the six hour drive there and the nine dollar ticket price.  During the drive back it was the only thing on my mind, sticking to my brain like gum on the bottom of one's shoe.  I couldn't stop thinking about it.  After the movie ended, everyone in the theatre just remained in their seats to mull over the movie.  This is why it's great filmmaking.  It challenges and engages the audience to look into their own lives and see how it relates to their personal experiences (which is why I loved Fight Club and American Beauty).  It's a philosophical look at memory, reality, and time, things that I've had a great interest in, all blended perfectly into a drink that viewers must sip and not chug in order to understand its complexity.  This is a movie where you can't leave your seats for a drink or a bathroom break (Hell, don't even take your eyes off the screen) because every scene is vital to the comprehension of the whole picture.  If you love a thinking movie and its not playing near you, check your area, pack a bag, and drive to the nearest theatre that it is playing because, I guarantee, that it's all worth it.  However, if your main attraction is mainstream releases then I think you need to stop reading this because it maybe too engaging for your brain to handle.8"
"Review of Memento : This movie was ok at best.  I give it points for having an original storyline.  It is worth seeing on that point only.  However, originality does not bring to this film any other good qualities: it is boring, poorly thought out, and much of the plot is irrelevant.  The subplot featuring Carrie Ann Moss has no connection to the overall conspiracy that the main character is searching for, and could just as easily have been left out. By the middle of the movie, I had mostly figured out everything, and there was no real mystery.  I give 4/10."
"Review of Memento : This is a film that makes you think and it takes a while to realise that you're basically seeing the film backwards - not really in flashbacks but almost like mirror-writing, if you know what I mean. It made me wonder how the film was made.Was the film made in a chronological order and then, by way of very clever editing, dissembled and then re-assembled in an ""anti-clockwise"" order? It's possible, with the addition of some extra scenes to cement the whole picture together.It was all very complicated, but it gripped me to the end. Once I started watching it I daren't leave it, because I felt that I wouldn't be able to pick up the plot again easily. I stayed up until 1am - when I had intended to see it over two-nights.I thought Guy Pearce excellent. Was this the same actor as in ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert""? I enjoyed watching his performance in ""LA Confidential"" too. Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss were new to me but they were impressive. A most enjoyable film, one to recommend."
"Review of Memento : Went to see this when I noticed it at number 12 all-time on the IMDb list. Figured I'd vote it low just to get realistic. Nope. Just have to give this a 9 or 10.Don't miss the first few minutes of the film. You're going to sit there for two hours that will fly like fifteen minutes.  You'll be just as desperate as Guy Pierce's character to make sense out of what is happening around him. The resolution of the plot is totally satisfying and makes perfect sense within the context of the movie.Pierce is absolutely incredible as he, with no short term memory, spins and wanders desperately confused through the story searching for those who raped and murdered his wife. You're as desperate, because at the start of the film you'll watch him kill the man he thinks killed his wife. Pierce, of course, has forgotten the kill - and the story takes you back piece by piece in time to see if he got the right man.One critic condemned the technique of moving backward in time in the movie. And, like the critic, I've seen the technique before and did not care for it.  But here it leaves the viewer with effectively no short-term memory, just like the main character.  People walk into his life and recognize him, you can tell, but he and you both have no idea who that person is. Can they be trusted? Why do they know him? You feel as frustrated and suspicious of everybody as he does. Tremendously well done."
