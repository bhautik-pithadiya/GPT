"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out. Shot on a micro budget of $6,000 this is a student film with real class. The film is shot in black and white, and features people who you assume are friends of Nolan's appearing in the movie. This is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago.Nolan's thriller, much like Memento, does not play chronologically, it shifts the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction. The writing is fantastic. It is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting. I thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent.
For a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all, this is so good. It is superior to most that Hollywood studios offer and Nolan after three films (this, the superior Memento and the not quite as good but still excellent Insomnia) has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times. I can't wait for Batman.This film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch. It is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising. I also thought that the score from David Julyan was also excellent, very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it. He has gone on to compose Nolan's other films. Overall I would recommend this, I intend to get all of Nolan's films. This is a low budget gem. *****"
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan had his goals set on Following in a very narrow direction, and in that direction he pulled off something that reminded me of the kind of great little 'poverty-row' movies the likes of Ullmer directed back in the 40s. Only this time, he's able to implement touches of homage- things like black and white photography (a given due to the shoe-string budget but also essential to the dark crevices these characters inhabit) and casting of the actors (the John Doe lead, the slick male counterpart, and the beautiful-in-a-gritty way femme fatale)- while keeping it in the realm of the 90s underground indie where for several thousand dollars and specific choices in locations and music and such anything could be possible. That, and as well in the film-noir mood Nolan also puts together a cunning web of a plot, maybe even more so than Memento. Where the latter was a work of a psychology unfolding by way of a plot enriched by looking to the past inch by inch, here the non-linear structure serves the purpose of showing how far someone like Bill can go through as dark a path as Cobb, only in an environment where keeping on your toes is not for someone who's not really twisted and into the deeper mind games Cobb is.Of course, the whole act of following someone becomes the main thrust of the story, and going into it I wasn't even sure where it would lead, if it might be some kind of stream of consciousness ala Slacker where Nolan would lead his character along to one urban British person to another. But the establishment of the ties of Bill to Cobb are done in a quick and excellent way, as we see right when Cobb approaches Bill at the caf√© to ask what he's doing following him tells almost all we need to know about both- that, and the first robbery he brings him along for. What seems to soon be a good score on the horizon is really all one big set-up by Cobb and his lady (just called 'The Blonde', maybe a too-obvious homage to noir, but why carp). But this is revealed in a way that actually truly had me guessing, as the manipulation of the narrative worked all the more to arouse questions not so much of why but of how. The density is brought out all the greater due to the actors understanding of their essential points as characters, with Alex Haw being brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely mask his 'deep' ideas about what it is to really take pleasure in a burglary, and Theobald with that demeanor of someone who can never be as smart as he is in what he really does, but is more intelligent in that naive way that stands no chance in the dank environment such as this; Russell almost makes it too easy, even with a face that would send Ana Savage shaking her head.Meanwhile, Nolan is also on the ball with his style as a cameraman, keeping nothing in that doesn't add to ambiance and suspense, with the fade-in/fade-outs not too quick to leave a lasting impression, but enough to add to the 'this-could-lead-anywhere' logic of the script. He follows it in hand-held form as if he knows where his limitations lie, and yet is fantastic at keeping the essentials: close-ups when need be (one I loved is Russell's face in a small mirror), and a fairly simple techno track that never detracts. Sometimes, as mentioned, the line between seeing something in 'present-day' and seeing something that is as everlasting as a solid pulp story of low-level criminals with mind-games and moral ambiguity is always never totally clear, which for me is practically irresistible in its dark way. Simply put, this is one of the great calling cards I've seen from a filmmaker in recent years, and should hopefully be something that future fans of Nolan's other work can look forward to to discovering. Or even to those who think that noir has gone to the rapid-editing and big-gun-firing dogs of the mainstream (even in independent films) it's a bright little 71 minutes."
"Review of Following : A debut movie of a great filmmaker is either a stinker (""Alien 3"", David Fincher) or a statement that he is there to stay. (""Reservoir Dogs"", Quentin Tarantino and ""Following"", Christopher Nolan). ""Following"" is a very well made film, considering the circumstances under which it was made. The film is, in fact, a rulebook or a template of future Nolan films. Most of his future movies can be found in ""Following"" in the sense that most of his future movies have - broken timeline and non linear storytelling making the movie more thrilling, crime or criminal-ish adventure, manipulation of people and a surprising reveal, that's either mindblowing or in the case of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012), studio's insistence. This movie is a crime thriller. Keeping away the circumstances and knowing nothing about other Nolan films, it's very good. Not excellent, not great, but simply very good. The pacing of the story feels rushed. There is character development but the pacing is so quick that we do not have enough time to get invested in the characters. Some things about the protagonist are simply addressed in the story by the characters in it, rather than telling it dramatically. The fight scenes and some acts of violence are a bit poorly choreographed. However, the suspense was excellent and the twists were mind blowing. Consider now, that you have watched Nolan's other movies as well. The rushed pace was inevitable for a movie which wanted to deliver a lot, but had only an hour of runtime. The issues with fight scenes and acts of violence are still the same, however, we can get a clue of how things played out off screen when a character addresses something about the protagonist. It's like the future Nolan films made it better. If you've seen any of his future movies containing a theme of manipulation, it's quite easy to figure out. The awesomeness of the suspense and the twists are retained. At last, consider that you also know how this movie got made. Man! It was lucky even to see the day! A budget of $6000 during the 90s for British film? It's probably gonna be forgettable. It might not be as good as it was supposed to be if it got a made under favorable circumstances, but surely ain't forgettable. I don't find it appropriate myself, but this movie is a masterpiece - in the sense that an almost no budget flick was made to be so good! I have seen other almost no budget films like ""A Fistful of Fingers"" (1995 or so) made by Edgar Wright, and it was just plain bad for me. I would never watch such films ever again, except for this one and any other such film, if I find them in the future. It was my fifth Nolan movie. I watched all three of his Batman movies, and I absolutely loved the second one, the first one was excellent and the third one was just good. Then I watched ""Memento"" (2000) which made me a Nolan fan. But it was this movie that made me appreciate him as a filmmaker in the way I do today. Judging it in a plain manner, I would give it an ""8/10"" and an ""A-"". But, for the reasons explained in this review, it gets a special ""10/10"" and an ""A+""."
"Review of Following : Revisiting the earliest features of acclaimed filmmakers can be a fascinating experience. Sometimes we'll see them exploring a style they moved on from, and often we'll see the first hints of their approach to making movies, and exploring familiar themes. Almost without exception, though - especially for those who are household names today, but got their start years ago - their early pictures are astoundingly low-budget, requiring no small amount of ingenuity and resourcefulness to see their labor come to fruition. To learn a bit of the history for 'Following' one quickly understands the lengths Christopher Nolan went to to produce his first film, and one can only admire his tenacity. The effort paid off handsomely, however: while the bare-bones nature of the production is fairly evident, it in no way dampens the quality of the end result, and if anything the ardor Nolan poured into this does much to mask how little he had to work with. I began watching with mixed expectations, based just on similar titles I've seen, but I cannot overstate just how impressed I am. 'Following' is fantastic!Simple as David Julyan's score is, I think his compositions do a fine job of complementing the tone of the film, and the mood in any given scene. Restricted as Nolan was to minimal equipment, I think the basic cinematography is really quite good, and reliance on natural or room lighting doesn't meaningfully hamper the experience. If anything, the extra shadow that pervades much of the runtime actually lends further to the dark deeds and atmosphere of the narrative. Even the cast is superb, elevating this small movie with no major backing to another level. Jeremy Theobald, Alex Haw, and Lucy Russell in particular (but certainly their co-stars in smaller roles) all lend great personality to their characters with performances of nuanced range and practiced physicality. None of them are stars of especial renown, but judging by this alone they deserve more recognition.Excellent as these many elements are, Nolan's writing is the grandest of all. One recognizes all the staples of classic noir: bad business, dirty dealings, dubious characters, and a deepening hole as events spiral out of control, and further timeless themes on top. The characterizations in the screenplay are wonderfully complicated and believable, with strong and varied personalities, backgrounds, motivations, and secrets. In light of the constraints of the production, it's extra clear how tight and fastidious the scene writing and dialogue are - detailed, but with no waste that could bog down the filming process. Above all, the narrative is altogether phenomenal, so unassuming as it begins but taking dire turns and going places I didn't anticipate. 'Following' boasts a couple substantial zigzags, and the way these are woven so naturally into the plot only heightens the impact.Very importantly, the structure of the narrative writing is critical - the non-linear nature of the storytelling has been noted, but that term alone doesn't quite capture the effect. The progression of the story is so pointedly disordered that it threw me for a loop at first, which was unquestionably intentional - Nolan himself has accordingly said that he built the film in a way so as to maintain an air of mystery and confusion for the viewer until the pristine moment. Well done, sir - it worked. Not dissimilarly, there came a time when I wondered if the disjointed construction was actually necessary, or just a novel affectation, yet almost as soon as I had this thought, in the next instant all doubts were cast aside. There is an astounding intelligence to the writing here that matches some of the very best in all of cinema.It bears repeating that no matter the reputation of a given filmmaker, their earliest movies are often a far cry from their most acclaimed works. I think it's only reasonable to approach a title like 'Following' with a measure of caution. I'm therefore all the more thrilled that this is so unfailingly brilliant as it is. It lacks the same polish, but this is a crime thriller on par with the best of anything Christopher Nolan has given us in all the years since, from 'Memento' to 'Tenet' and all points between. It's such a delightfully satisfying, rewarding experience as a viewer that I can only offer my highest and most enthusiastic recommendation for all comers. 'Following' is an absorbing, compelling neo-noir that demands far more attention; if you have the opportunity to watch, don't pass it up!"
"Review of Following : This is a truly brilliant film, and all the more remarkable for being the first film of director Christopher Nolan (director of MEMENTO and INSOMNIA), made on a tiny budget. It is a triumph of genius over money, as there was almost no money but plenty of genius sploshing around all over the place. Everybody is good, every aspect is good. The film totally 'clicked'. The lead actors are perfectly cast and are superb in their roles. Jeremy Theobald (any relation to Theobald's Road in London?) plays a hangdog would-be writer who lives alone in his leather jacket, lean and unshaven, and with an old manual typewriter, on which he types things occasionally. He munches on the odd bit of food from time to time like a stray dog who has come across a bone in the street, and is not someone who has ever acted on the suggestion: 'Get a life!' He develops a strange habit of following strangers in the street 'just to see where they are going' and understand more about people. He generally stops the pursuit when they enter their homes, and then he goes off and finds another stranger and never follows anyone twice. Sounds harmless, but like all habits, it develops tentacles. What he does not realize is that one peculiar man whom he follows, played with brilliant and sinister force by Alex Haw, is cannier than he could imagine. Haw has noticed that he is being followed and ends up following Theobald, who is unaware that the tables have been turned on him. This has catastrophic consequences, which are slow to dawn upon Theobald. Haw is involved in the criminal world and decides to set up Theobald and frame him. In this, he is complicit with a mysterious woman played by Lucy Russell with a droll and languid manner which is just right for the part. The ultimate payoff of this film is the fantastically bizarre twists of plot which keep emerging from the sinuous coils of this writhing serpent of a story. The script is also by Christopher Nolan, and is thoroughly brilliant. In addition, Nolan also did the spectacular cinematography and the inspired editing. That is what I mean by lots of genius sploshing around. How can a guy that clever live with himself? (Nolan and Theobald were also co-producers with Emma Thomas.) Is there anything Christopher Nolan cannot do? Scratch his own back in the bath? I bet he can do that too. One thing which astonishes me about this film is that the talented Alex Haw, who made his film debut in it, seems never to have appeared in another film. Did he fall through a hole in the earth? I would have expected him to have been in a dozen other movies by this time. This was also Lucy Russell's film debut (as 'The Blonde'), but she has since worked non-stop in films and television. So why not Alex Haw? For those who do not know, by the way, the word 'haw' is the name of the fruit of the hawthorn tree, also known as the May Tree. Maybe Haw will break forth into blossom again next May, along with all his namesakes in the hedgerows. This superlative film has all the excellent qualities of the best of the old-time Hollywood film noir pictures, even though it was made in London with wholly British people, including Nolan himself. But then Alfred Hitchcock was British, let us not forget. It also has a kind of Wim Wenders 'quality feel' about it, as if the writer-director were a deep thinker, and the wanderings through the streets of the 'follower' are a bit random, like a road movie, but a road movie that all takes place in one city. I think Nolan must have been trying to portray the world of quantum physics on the screen, with people as his electrons and positrons. Watching this eerie film is like staring at a moving version of one of those photos from a Wilson Cloud Chamber showing all of the tracks of the invisible atomic particles. Watch them jump and swirl! Watch them suffer! Watch them kill! Watch them be killed! But above all, watch them be hopelessly trapped and entangled in a larger scheme which they do not understand! Flies enter webs, and so sometimes do people who unwisely try 'following'. The ending cannot be revealed, but is even more extraordinary than the rest of the story, so that everything we thought we knew and had figured out now takes on another and even more sinister shape entirely."
"Review of Following : Even with only 6,000 bucks and a cast of part-time actors, Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is in my opinion, the next great and our first taste of Nolan doesn't contradict that.None of the problems that constantly plaque and discredit the low budget independent picture haunt Nolan and crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver and engage us in this story. In all honesty I think Following is Nolan's best screenplay because it is the one he had the most control over. It's a beautifully imagined film. It takes us into a world where we don't feel limited by the constraints of budget. The dialogue and atmosphere is bold and intelligent.Nolan's trademark method of telling the story out of continuity is applied for the first time here and here it is done in a way that throws the story full out at you. With Memento and The Prestige you have to think a bit to truly get a complete grasp on the genius but Nolan doesn't try to confuse people with his prototype film. We can distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist. This method of telling a story is both creative and engaging. I am Glad that Nolan has had so much success with it because his films become more than what they could be with this method. The pay offs in the Prestige and Memento would not have been thrilling at all if the movie was told in a conventional format. This idea has been done with moderate success before but Nolan has truly made it his own.The script here is Nolan's finest. I had some doubts about his writing abilities, I all ways imagined that his brother Jonathon was the writing talent but he proves me wrong with Following. It is a thought provoking story which makes interesting observations of people and how they function. Cobb's assessments about burglarizing and how it can lead you to discover what makes people tick actually sounds plausible.My only real complaint is the camera work gets shaky at times but it doesn't take away anything from the story or the acting.Following is the first film of the man who will personify 21st century film-making at it's finest."
"Review of Following : An excellent debut movie for the the director of Batman Begins, comes the Following, a movie about a man who follows other people for inspiration of characters in stories he writes. One man he follows, he decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he bargained for.Using a cast of non-actors and his uncle, writing directing producing and otherwise completely making this movie entirely on his own with almost no budget and produced independently, this movie is much more than you'd expect.For anyone who likes Memento and complex twists, turns, shocks, and messing around with time, this is definitely a movie for you."
"Review of Following : Great film for how like to know everything about every buddy, it's just like me .. .... ... . ..... ....... .... .. .... ... ): ..... ........ ..... .... .... . ... ... . . . . ."
"Review of Following : First, I thought it was just a movie about one following someone and digging deep. But it couldn't BE more better. The director of the film speaks for himself - Christopher Nolan"
"Review of Following : It is the story of Bill, an aspiring writer who decides to start following people at random, just to see what they do, thinking it will give him special insight for his writing. When one of his targets, a burglar named Cobb who breaks into people's homes not so much to steal things as to voyeuristically look into people's lives, approaches him, Bill finds himself involved in a very strange relationship.It begins with an interrogation/confession. A young man named Bill (Jeremy Theobald, who brings a halting, naturalistic freshness to his voice-over and dialog) is being questioned by an older man (John Nolan) about his habit of following people just to see what they do and where they go. He kind of rationalizes that it's ""research"" (he wants to be a writer), but it seems more likely that he's unemployed and bored. There's an element of voyeurism at work, but it's not primarily sexual -- at least not at first. It's more like he doesn't really know much about people, and he's curious to see how they behave. He explains a thought experiment where he picks somebody out of a crowd at a football game and, suddenly, they become an individual to him.In ""Following"" you see Nolan's affinity for convoluted chronological structure and the final twist, in which all the jigsaw plot pieces snap into place and you finally see the whole picture (along with the main character). You may wonder just how necessary/integral they are, but they help make the film fun to watch, even if they don't necessarily add up to a whole lot.And I'm not just referring to the auspicious Batman sticker on the door of its protagonist's flat (how could he have known... unless the past and the future were somehow folded together... ?). The other thing which is great about Following is that it is only 70mins long. In a time when it is becoming increasingly common for films to go well beyond the two-hour mark regardless of whether they really need to or not, it is refreshing to see a filmmaker show that a good story can be told in under 90 minutes.Christopher Nolan made an interesting little noir-thriller called Following. Nolan's debut feature, Following is a no-budget film shot hand-held in grainy, black-and-white. Nolan wrote, directed, produced and shot the film himself. For cast and crew, he used friends and acquaintances, with the picture being shot over a period of about a year, shooting on Saturdays whenever people were free."
"Review of Following : Hooo Hoo....saw it for 4th time in my life and its still such a revealing experience. Nolan with this script unleashed the potential of him and what a good screenplay can do even to a straight forward story.The story is of a man who is tangled by his own deed of following people and then from a culprit becomes a witness and a victim too. The progression is so non linear till the very end its hard to realize what is actually happening and when did it happen. Like in the beginning, the protagonist falls on the ground and a cloth comes out of his mouth, we wonder what would have happened and this is revealed in the climax. There are many scenes that come and go but have a lot of meaning later and just keep us hanging in delirium.It's a tough one to decipher or construe the whole story happenings in a linear way so that would just take out the fun, its better to be watched and enjoyed the wau it is. The acting is fine but there are not many emotions displayed and mostly they are told with a straight face and a bland expression. Had it been done with professional actors, it would have been much more joyful. But, this movie has to be acclaimed hugely for it's all newcomers approach.The cost is minimal because of no remuneration to actors, it's all done in natural lighting and now additional lighting used. Its done on a 16mm film camera as against a 35mm so to reduce cost and the best part, this movie was shot all in all within 6000$ and the shooting was done only on weekends as actors were working on week days. Nolan has to be appreciated for his patience and perseverance and the actors for giving their time and making it what it is today.Great thanks to Nolan for making every aspiring film maker believe that if we have the content right, the budget or the lighting or the camera do not matter, what matters is how we shall present it at the end of the day.Nolan rocks with his first movie and though his other movies made him bigger, this was the firm beginning of a great director. It's 5/5 for the best independent and the lowest budget movie ever."
"Review of Following : This film was very well done and the shots were unique enough for me to take note of them for films of my own. Personally i'm not a big black and white fan but there was something about this that seemed soothing to my eyes, unlike most black and whites. Also the actors were great, they did an excellent job portraying their characters. I loved how the actor portraying Cob made me hate him so much, especially at the end. When it comes to the plot, this story is very unlike traditional Hollywood films with happy endings, for 15 minutes I was arguing with myself over wither or not a hated or loved this movie. I'm not sure, but i think this is either Christopher Nolan's 2nd or 3rd film and even if this was his 5th i would still be astounded. I don't know much information about the scores in this film or if they were original, but I felt that they went along with the film very smoothly and fit the scenes perfectly."
"Review of Following : For a long time, I've been dying to see this movie. I absolutely love Christopher Nolan and I wanted to see all of his films, especially the one that started his career. Wow, not only did it exceed all expectations I had for it, but I think it might be my new favourite of his work. The story is brilliant. It's constructed in a nonlinear style and takes a lot of ingenious twists and turns. The characters are so well written. They feel so convincing and are very interesting. The editing and cinephotography are also excellent. I absolutely love the low budget feel. Overall, this film is incredible and I highly recommend it."
"Review of Following : Given Christopher Nolan's string of successful films, it's a no brainer for me to want to check out his filmography watch his debut feature, which is shot in black and white back in England, running less than 70 minutes long, done with little budget, but containing all the hallmarks that has made him a master filmmaker and storyteller.Though short, the film is no less gripping with its meandering plot that will leave you guessing, because the premise doesn't even scratch the surface of this tale, which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the narrative's structure and characterization. As told, we follow a writer wannabe called Bill (Jeremy Theobald) who starts a habitual obsession with following random people he fancies on the streets in a voyeuristic manner, which at first could be conceived as research, before he starts to make up his own rules, and break them.He meets up with charismatic Cobb (Alex Haw) who turns out to be a robber with peculiar sensibilities and modus operandi, and soon finds himself hooked with hanging out with him as they go about breaking and entering and speculating about their victim's livelihood, as does the pursuit of a femme fatale blond (Lucy Russell), a mobster's moll who rejects his every advance.Told in a non-linear fashion which comes with scenes that don't quite add up in the beginning, this sets the film up for multiple viewings as you study just how Nolan sustains that suspense and intrigue with you as the audience expecting and wanting more, which gets duly delivered. There are enough twists here which spins the film into a dizzying crescendo, where loose ends begin to come together, and the brilliance of the stellar story start to shine through.It's also amazing how, as a first feature shot on the cheap, that something that clever and sophisticated can be conceived from his own experience in being burgled, with Nolan involved in every stage of production, from writing to shooting, producing and directing, having worked on the project for a year since shoots can only happen on weekends. I guess here's an example of a successful filmmaker's humble roots, which should serve as inspiration and spur new filmmakers out there. Now I'll patiently wait for Christopher Nolan's Inception due out later this year, whose trailer is already such a tease."
"Review of Following : I'm amazed that Memento (which is an excellent flick) is so well-regarded in the Top 250 and this one doesn't even appear!! What the hell is that?? To be honest - when this movie ended my knee-jerk reaction was that this movie is better than Memento. After the euphoria of the fabulous ending wore off, I concluded that they are equal in their excellence. I am just confused about why its not in the Top 50 along with Memento. I'm going to venture a guess that (sadly) it's because it's in black and white or because (again sadly)that the characters all have British accents ...sadly because that is no reason to not appreciate a great movie like this.I'm telling you that if you loved Memento, you will love Following as well. Brilliant!"
Review of Following : Following is the best independent film to ever come out of England.  A truly inspiring masterpiece!
"Review of Following : Unfortunately, I have not had the fortune of ever writing a comment on IMDB before, but I plan to start today by writing a commentary on the great movie, Following, by Christopher Nolan. Having seen Memento before this movie, I had very high expectations, and I am glad to say that these expectations were thoroughly met with this 61 minute film noir. No review quite accurately describes Following. Imagine, if you will, Memento filmed completely in black and white. Much lower budget, but still not completely shabby style. The film is similar in many ways to Memento, building the foundation which led to the excellent film which has been added to many critics' (not that that means anything special)top 100 movies of all time lists. The plot line is not really all that important, but it is the characters, dialogue, and overall atmosphere of the film that makes it what it is. It's very unique, and shows a great deal about the human mind, if you can believe that, and is a very entertaining film. Although thoroughly surpassed by Christopher Nolan's later work, Memento, Following is definitely worth looking into if you are in the mood for a great film that requires little time, but much insight."
"Review of Following : Such a jaw dropping moment at climax. The director tells an extraordinary crime story within 1h in his feature film. The story was simple but how he expressed to audience in a Non Linear screenplay makes the film Amazing. Lots of Twist makes us jaw dropping but the viewers can't understand this movie by watching at once, it may take twice or thrice to understand that's the UNIQUENESS OF SIR CHRIS NOLAN. don't miss"
"Review of Following : From the same director as ""Memento"" comes ""Following"", a low budget film made in the UK entirely on black and white stock.Everything that was lacking in ""Memento"" is here in ""Following"".Despite having a cast of little known actors, every one of them turns in a splendid performance, particularly Alex Haw as ""Cobb"" the burglar. He is the perfect mix of intelligence, flash, and violence for such a film.Scenes appear out of sequence, and can be confusing at times, but after you've been watching a while, everything comes together. The surprise ending is one of the best I've ever encountered. Not one person who views the film will ever guess it.Whereas ""Memento"" was overly long and had a number of dull parts interpsersed throughout, ""Following"" is gripping the entire time. It's also just about an hour in length.It could not have cot much to film this at all, as it is simply made in a series of plain London apartments and out on the street. It's just more evidence that expensive and gaudy special effects are no substitute for sharp acting, strong writing and directing, and thoughtful input."
"Review of Following : When film started i did not think i was going to like it, but i held in there and kept watching. It started to grow on me and then i looked at my Netflix Package and saw that it was Christopher Nolan directing. I had no idea, but then all of a sudden I was watching the film from a different perspective. Isn't that funny. All of a sudden I liked it much better. I feel bad for being so easily persuaded, but nevertheless this was a well made and I am to assume low budget film for Mr. Nolan. Very similar to his Momento"" editing back and forth, forth and back cutting style. I had to watch a few parts over again to understand, but once I did I was glad I watched it over. The acting is okay, the directing is simple. It is nicely shot in black and white, some of it seems over blown but maybe it was ny television. There is a very interesting score as well. I recommend it."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan is God!!!!!!!!!. Hands Down this is the best suspense movie of the 90's. Mind you Nolan made Memento in 2000 and that even beats this. But oh my god, the movie is stunning and narration is excellent.A writer has a very weird habit of following people, but frames rules for himself so that he does not get into trouble (as rules are meant to be broken), he gets into trouble.Unlike Memento where the full story was told in the reverse, here the movie is told in 2 parts with consecutive scenes in each. So the viewer can relate what happens now to see what had happened before.The last 30 Min's have some of the finest moments and the last scene which happens to be the start of the movie leaves you staggering.the guy who wrote the script for the movie whoever it is ""he is too good"""
"Review of Following : It's odd how many similarities I can draw between the feature film debuts of some of today's most gifted directors. Take for example Darren Arrenofsky, Quentin Tarantino, and of course Christopher Nolan. Each of their respective features was shot in black and white (Tarantino originally intended to shoot `Reservoir Dogs' in b&w but things changed when he got a real budget for the film by attracting talents like Harvey Keitel, but still maintained his high contrast palette of Black, White and Red), which is something they do in order to save time and money in setting up the scenes to have the right colors and contrast. Also, black and white film is cheaper. What they manage to do is concentrate on telling the best story in their respective genres, getting the best performances they possibly can out what is usually friends and acquaintances. They show at this early stage that they what counts, that being a fantastic script, the finest performances they can get out of their actors, and the best cinematography their visions can get from their tiny budgets. Not surprising that I find myself greatly enjoying these first time features, sometimes even more than the great films they make afterwards (Tarantino = Pulp Fiction, Nolan = Memento, Arrenofsky = Requiem for a Dream), which, by a hair, is the case with this one.	`Following' tells the story of a writer whose hobby is to follow strangers around simply to see what they do in a day. Things suddenly change when he is confronted by one of the people he is following, a thief by the name of Cobb who convinces him to break into an apartment without the intention of stealing but rather to rearrange certain things in such a way as to affect their lives. If I go any further I may spoil to surprises to come, and there are many. This movie only gets better as time passes, almost transforming into something else by the time it is done. I was so shocked by the ending that I desperately rewound to see what I had missed. Should have known, what I saw here was the early development of the technique he used in `Memento' telling its story from different points in time. Both these films are different, so don't think he just re-made `Memento' from this. He's obviously got more tricks up his sleeve.	Another plus about this movie is in not knowing who the actors are, and watching them simply be these characters. In no way did I second guess their performance, instead I believed they were who I saw  on my screen, watching as people stab each other in the back, wondering the whole time how things will add up and who's going to do what. Playing at a tad over an hour you will not believe just how much they manage to fit into this story, a perfect example of a well labored script, not wasting anytime on useless filler nor rushing us in and out of important scenes.	Visually I found `Following' to be gorgeous. It is not over ambitious in its appearance, knowing at all times that its substance is much more important than its style, yet it perfectly captures the scenes moods and the feeling of its characters. I loved the editing, which combined with the overlapping voice-overs completely had me entranced, pulling me deeper into this tale of deceit. I leaned forward towards the t.v. many times throughout this picture, almost wanting to look harder even though I knew that would only get me in more trouble. With films such as this that has always been the case, the harder you try to figure things out the harder it is to follow. 	Do yourself a favor and rent this if you're able to find it. Knowing that most of you out there enjoyed `Memento' then you should definitely give `Following' a chance, and you might find yourself liking this film as much as that one. Again great praise to Mr. Nolan for giving us all something to aspire to as storytellers and for keeping me guessing, now having managed to do it 3 times. (`Following', `Memento', and `Insomnia'¬Ö seems like he enjoys using one word disorders as titles)."
"Review of Following : Wow. I was very impressed with this movie. After watching this movie, I can now say with confidence that Christopher Nolan is a genius. At first, I didn't know what to expect with this movie. Of course I had read the back's description... but that didn't prepare me for what turned out to be such an amazing movie. The black and white gives the movie a feel of coldness. One thing I especially enjoyed about this movie was Cobb's dialogue, when they first break into the apartment. It is simply brilliant. It provided so much insight into how we live our lives. I can't recall how many times I thought to myself, ""ya, that's true"". The way the story was structured was great. At first, I didn't expect this so I was really confused. Luckily, I caught on soon enough. Being a fan of Nolan's other masterpiece Memento (where are all the nominations?!), I really love the way he uses time to distort what we perceive. A great feature on the DVD was to play the story in chronological order. I wish this was also done on the Memento DVD. All in all, this was a great movie. If you were a fan of Memento, you definitely need to check this out!"
"Review of Following : Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal' way, once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this doozy of a film noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story intertwine), and once with the director's commentary running. Quite amazing. A bare-bones tale, told with more flair, energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today. I think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent Memento, which turned me on to Nolan in the first place. Can't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget (and bigger box-office stars) in his next film, Insomnia."
"Review of Following : Bill, Jeremy Theobald, is an inspiring writer who hasn't gotten anything published as of yet. Bill also has an odd and strange habit, he likes to follow people.Bill picks out some stranger in the streets diner or on the subway, metro, and follows them as if he were their shadow. Maybe Bill does this to help him in inspiring himself to write the great novel that he's been dreaming about or get an article of his get printed in a major magazine? Maybe it's because it fills Bill's lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by his paying attention to him or her? Or maybe it gives Bill someone to look after and care about and be responsible for besides himself? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone : after you follow him or her to their home or place of work you stop. One day Bill follows Cobb, Alex Haw, home and instead of following his rule of stopping he still keeps following Cobb. Bill will soon realize how right he was with that rule he set for himself in following people and at the same time how wrong he was by breaking it. Amazingly good low-budget movie made by Christopher Noland in 1998 before he hit it big in Hollywood with his ground-breaking and original motion picture classic ""Momento"" some two years later that has already become a major cult movie. ""Following"" is actually a much better movie then ""Momento"" because it's a conventional and easy to follow story. Compared to ""Momento's"" which was at first confusing and then when you realize what the movie is telling you in it's backward storyline very complicated. Whats makes ""Following"" so much better is just by it being simple but at the same time brainy in it's affect on those who watch it. The movie is far more direct as well as devastating and you don't have to see it over and over to get just what it was trying to tell them like ""Momento"" did. ""Following"" is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising as well as simply manipulated ending, if you watch the movie again and notice the clues, that you'll ever see.Made with an unbelievably small budget of $6,000.00, thats less then what most Hollywood movies budgets out for coffee-breaks, with a no-name cast in black and white and just over one hour, 71 minutes, long. Hollywood as well as the motion picture industry outside of Hollywood can learn a lot from Chris Noland in how someone with nothing more then talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can't; make an intelligent and at the same time penetrating film with next to nothing in money and no big name stars."
"Review of Following : I saw this movie after I saw Memento.  I was very impressed with Memento so when I saw this at the local video store, I decided to check it out.  I was equally impressed with this little film.  I like black and white films so that was bonus, especially for a noir film.  I thought the acting was very good by actors I have never noticed in other films.  It is short and makes you think, which you can't state about many films.  I loved to guess where a film is going and 90% of the time I know the general outline of the film and where it is going in the first 10 minutes.  Nolan's films are never that easy to decipher at first glance.  I won't spoil the film other than to state the protagonist of the film is not talking to his shrink after he has taken his stalking too far at the beginning of the film as I originally surmised.  This movie is basically a rough draft for some of the ideas and themes Nolan would later explore and exploit in Memento. It works on its own and if Nolan had never done anything afterwards would still be a major talent."
"Review of Following : FILM: 9/10.Christopher Nolan's feature-length directorial debut, Following, is an absolute masterclass in filmmaking. Right from the start, the non-linear storytelling and the way the narrative unfolds is captivating. Nolan's ability to keep viewers engaged and guessing is impressive.The film has all the hallmarks of Nolan's signature style that we've come to love in his later works. The writing is incredibly smart, with each scene serving a purpose and contributing to the overall story. It's always a joy to connect the dots and piece together the puzzles Nolan weaves in his works.The concept behind Following is intriguing and thought-provoking. It delves into the themes of identity, obsession, and the blurred lines between reality and fiction. The characters are complex and layered, and their interactions are both tense and riveting. Their journeys and choices unfold to the tune of David Julyan's sparse, but effective score.Nolan's direction is tight and focused, showcasing his talent even in his early days as a filmmaker. The black and white cinematography adds a noir-like atmosphere, further enhancing the film's mysterious and suspenseful tone. The attention to detail is remarkable, and every shot feels purposeful. It remains an impressive effort even when stscked up his more recent works.While Following might not have the scale or grandeur of Nolan's later blockbusters, it doesn't diminish its impact. In fact, it's precisely the film's modesty that allows it to shine. The minimalistic approach, combined with Nolan's keen storytelling instincts, creates a truly compelling cinematic experience.It might sound like hyperbole, but Following is a brilliant debut and dangerously close to being a masterpiece. It showcases Nolan's talent and sets the stage for his future successes. If you're a fan of his work, this film is a must-watch. And even if you're not familiar with Nolan, Following stands on its own as a gripping and thrilling piece of cinema. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 10/10.1080p presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.DTS HD-MA 5.1 & LPCM mono audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Good, LFE content: GoodMOOFIEMETER: 9/10."
"Review of Following : Most good directors make few low budget or few normal budget movies or some T.V shows before they make a great influential movie because some afraid to take risks, some need to prosper and many don't have what it takes, Christopher Nolan wasn't one of those directors because he made a great movie right at the beginning with so little money and this movie proves that what I am saying is right. I've seen many good directors' first movies so I know what to expect from a good director's first movie and this movie exceeded my expectations. I knew that it is just 69 minutes long before I start seeing it but it is so well directed and written that during and after seeing it I find hard to believe that it's just 69 minutes long because it gave me a good 2 hours movie experience in just 69 minutes.The actors did a great job in it, they acted like they are good professional actors. Its a shame that Jeremy Theobald and the charming Alex Haw didn't go far after this movie and its a shame that Lucy Russell didn't go as far as she should be.Only geniuses like Christopher Nolan himself can make great extremely low budget movies like Following."
"Review of Following : After all the overblown, overlong films I have seen recently thank goodness to find a real gem.  Gritty, twisted and intelligent.  Watch Hollywood grab Christopher Nolan and give him large budgets. Lucy Russell looks just as if she could walk into Philip Marlowe's office and kick start Bogart."
"Review of Following : The very first full-length movie from Nolan already contains many of the director's trademarks: a heavy timeline-based edition, somewhat intriguing plot and a few (maybe more than necessary) twists.In this case, the B&W filming gives a noir mood, and helped to hide the bad acting in many moments. I recommend watching it if you want to know a early Nolan in all his essence, and to notice how some signature moves could turn a director in a cliche of himself."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan is a film director whose talent was so quickly recognised that his second feature Memento was given a budget of four-and-a-half million dollars. His debut, 1998's Following is a different matter: made on a shoe-strung budget and shot on 16 mm black-and-white film, and starred a cast of non-professional actors who had to film around their day jobs. The fact that it is, in spite of this, remarkably impressive, makes it easy to understand why Nolan subsequently had no difficulty getting funds thrown at him.The plot of Following concerns a man credited simply as The Young Man who follows strangers around London in order to provide inspiration for a novel he intends to write. One day he follows professional burglar Cobb, who spots him, takes him under his wing and teaches him how to break into and burgle houses. As The Young Man becomes ever more embroiled in his newfound criminal lifestyle, he soon finds himself increasingly out of his depth as he is drawn into the orbit of gangers The Bald Man and the Bald Man's ex-girlfriend, The Blonde.In many ways, Following feels like a dry run for Memento, with a non-linear narrative, an unreliable narrator, and several twists. It's both dark and witty: Nolan also wrote the screenplay and as well as boasting a complex plot, it also benefits from impressive characterisation, with every character proving believable despite their lack of real names; for example Cobb, an eloquent burglar who can deduce a vast amount about his victims from their belongings, is fascinating character and his philosophical approach to his chosen ""profession"" is brilliantly, blackly comic. The framing sequence sees The Young Man recounting how he came to be in his current position to a Policeman; even as his tale unfolds, additional material is expertly woven into the narrative making it eventually apparent that he is sadly deluded about the truth of his situation until it is far, far too late.Nolan's flair for direction is immediately obvious. The grainy 16 mm monochrome film stock might have been a budgetary choice, but it significantly contributes to the film noir aesthetic that inspired the director, with the result that a film made on the cheap never actually looks cheap. Every shot is perfectly framed and perfectly lit. Nolan also edited the film, expertly assembling individual scenes jigsaw-like into a picture that only becomes clear at the end. The finishing touch is a simple but effective soundtrack from David Julyan, who would reap the rewards of his association with Nolan by scoring his next few - increasingly big budget - films and thus launch his own career.With the exception of Nolan's uncle John Nolan, who plays the Policeman to whom The Young Man tells his story, there are no professional actors in Following, although Lucy Russell (The Blonde) subsequently became one. Nevertheless, Nolan coaxes convincing and naturalistic performances out of all of them, especially Jeremy Theobald as the film's protagonist and Alex Haw as the charismatic and ultimately ruthless Cobb.Debut films of well-known and critically acclaimed film directors are sometimes mere curiosities, and sometimes demonstrate early promise but don't live up to later works: watching Following, it is apparent that Nolan's only limitation at this early point in his career was money and even with very little he managed to deliver a movie that is more interesting, more intelligent and more stylish than many Hollywood blockbusters."
"Review of Following : No kidding. I'm from 2014 and so far this has been Christopher Nolan's best work. So yes, better than TDK, Memento or Inception.The story was excellent. Some might find it similar to Fight Club. Initially it's about a young writer who follows stranger for his writing things. Then he met this devil may care burglar, who took the young writer under his wing. First I thought I'm learning some sort of life lessons. Then Christopher Nolan fooled me several times. In the end it's just a plain crime thriller.The unknown actors' performances were way above a lot of today's so called big names. And when you look at the Following's title page in IMDb, you'll notice that the two main actors Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw don't have any profile pictures. Such a shame.I my opinion the low budget helped the film to be better. The black and white fits perfectly with the everything else. Nolan didn't take any advantage of London, he could have shot the film anywhere in the world and it would work. David Julyan did usual excellency with the score to describe the environment.Lastly I'd rather watch more movies like this than Oscar winners or Box Office successes."
"Review of Following : I have to say for a directorial debut this film is very good. The plot is good, acting is good for a low budget film, writing is great, the plot comes together better than Tenet his most recent film. Overall a quite good film.Considering it's his first film, it's 10x than pretty much every other directors debut. It is a genuinely good film, and it's a film I'd recommend to anyone to show how to make a really good film on an extremely low budget. It's so interesting about how the budget of this film is ¬£6,000, but doesn't feel like it. Nolan is a master director and writer.9/10"
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is a memorable one. The film was very well received and help land contracts for making 'Memento' and quite rightfully so. Following is an exquisite example of how films should be made. No fancy effects or blood-dripping gore...just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writing. The actors, all unknowns to me and I suppose most people, did a good job bringing the characters to live. They were all believable and that's all they need to be. The film is confusing because it plays with chronology a lot but it's very rewarding in the end. The film's a little short to be a full-length feature but any additional length would've ruined the style of the movie and the brilliance of the writing would've been diminished. Though short, the film has every aspect that makes a film attractive (IMO): an intriguing beginning, an exciting middle and a surprising end. I dare say Following is almost as good as Memento, his best film by far. The scrambled chronology is equally masterful used in both films, the amazing plot twists are present and the acting is very good.This film was made with a mere $6000 but the quality is much higher than most( almost all) million dollar box-office hits. The use of b&w may be a hard pill to swallow for the big audience, following is primarily Nolan showing off his skills to the studio bosses :-). And what skills they are...rarely have I enjoyed writing so much as in 'Following'. Even Pi doesn't even come close IMO, though it's also very good.This is a film surely not to be missed by any self-respecting movie-lover. If you liked Memento, 'Following' is definitely for you."
"Review of Following : It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision that hindsight offers you can see the cogs and wheels that make these people what they are. Following is one such look into the past of Christopher Nolan, one of the great time-warping story-teller of today.Christopher Nolan's style of film-making puts a great deal of emphasis on the delivery of the story. Although people might complain it relies too much on the back-and-forth shifting of time, I still find it fascinating to see how he uses that one technique differently each time. Memento was probably the most convoluted piece of story-telling I have ever seen. Discount the hardened cynics who say it is an old piece of meat wrapped in fancy dressing. Memento shows how even the simplest of stories can be turned into a mind-bender. The Prestige, which was considerably stripped down in comparison, still showed creativity in how its three stories were interwoven. Even in a jaded enterprise like the Batman series did Christopher Nolan sprinkle some of his outstanding yarn-weaving tricks, breathing new life into the dark knight.Following is an intense tale of intrigue and mystery, where we see a dilettante writer, who becomes a reluctant voyeur, who becomes an unknowing accomplice to a variety of petty crimes, and finally sees an end no one could have expected. Having never heard of Following before, I had no idea what I was to expect. At every point the film kept me guessing as to where it was leading me. Since the mystery angle was clear, I was constantly trying to figure out what was going to happen next. And that is where I think the film succeeds so well. The film has many elements that led me off on many wild goose chases.The film is entirely in black and white and told in multiple timelines, both of which are considered gimmicky these days. Following does all of this in the least formulaic or contrived way possible. There doesn't seem to be a reason why the story is told in the way it is, but you don't feel like you are being taken for a ride. The lack of pretension or self-aware arrogance is what makes this style of story-telling work. Highly recommended!"
"Review of Following : An untidy man, known as Bill, lives in a small dreary flat, with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall, and his typewriter for company. Only the man can't think of anything to write. He wanders around the streets following people, just to see where they go. Maybe this will give him some inspiration to write. He begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag. He follows him for a few days. While in a cafe, the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of Bill, and inquires why Bill is following him. The well dressed man says his name is Cobb. Cobb then surprisingly informs Bill that he is a burglar, and even starts to take Bill with him into houses to steal things; although Cobb insists he doesn't go into other people's homes to just steal. He says he likes to let people know he has been there, and interrupted the things they take for granted. He puts knickers from another burglary into a man's trousers, for example.The film is told in flashbacks at times too. The director used this technique in greater abundance in his recent feature Memento. Bill eventually decides to cut his hair and dress in a suit, on the advice of Cobb. He meets a Blonde lady in a club, who used to date the owner, a bald man, who is very dangerous, she says. We see a scene where a hammer is used by the bald man's hence men on a man's fingers in the Blonde lady's flat. These are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us, and they will all fit into place when we arrive at the surprising conclusion."
"Review of Following : Following (1998) is an intense and memorable start to Christopher Nolan's career. The Film is not only visually impressive showcasing the early signs of Nolan's Signature style, but the story is what really sticks out. An intense crime drama portrayed as a puzzle jumping between past, present, and future while juggling a diverse and nuanced cast of characters turn this budget project into an authentic experience. While the film does lack some polish, especially concerning the soundtrack and what will become an entire career of sometimes hard-to-hear dialogue, these flaws don't take away too much from the movie overall. Following is a film about a unique idea that oozes Nolan's style and passion in a refreshing and extremely well-done manner. It should not be overlooked by its age and at the time, amateur director, as the film excels with what it has to offer. Overall, Amazing!"
"Review of Following : This topic should have pleased a director like Alan Pakula, a kind of chess game between two characters, as SLEUTH was in sme way. This early Christopher Nolan's job is promising and can also be seen as a some tribute to old film noirs from Hollywood forties B pictures, starring Lloyd Nolan or Warner Baxter. This is a must see but, I repeat, a bit hard to follow for an idiot like me. But the bulk of the audiences are fortunately not like me...Concerning Chris Nolan's next picture: MEMENTO, useless to say I quit long before the end...."
"Review of Following : This movie is first long movie of Christopher Nolan and if you watch by know this, you love this movie. Just a different experience and i love different things."
"Review of Following : Initially I was annoyed that the movie was shot in arty, grainy B&W. But the script and storyline is very clever. And for a first movie from someone who hadn't studied at film school, and presumably just had their friends as actors, if the $6,000 budget is to be believed, the direction and acting are superb, maybe better than some of his blockbusters."
"Review of Following : As a young aspiring filmmaker that has no idea where/how to start making films, this movie showed me that money is not an issue. You should use what is within your reach and make it happen. If you don't have money, skill or time to get insane color grading, huge dolly shots or high-end professional lighting equipment just record on black and white, hand-held, take advantage of the natural daylight and don't do a 3 hours long film. This feature film directed by Christopher Nolan, the man behind some of the biggest movies in the current generation and nominated for multiple Oscars, was made with a 6,000$ budget! If you pay close attention to the movie you can see that but when you do you are already into an intriguing story, a mysterious thriller about a young man who follows strangers and meets a burglar that doesn't steal for the money."
"Review of Following : You can early see typical Nolan inspiration in this and what a debut for one of the greatest directors of all time!The story is amazing! And storytelling is fabulous!Acting is amazingly performed! Characters is very well written!Filming is perfect!The ambience and atmosphere is very good!""Following"" is a very deep, sad and intriguing reflection on utilization, individualism, society and differences in humans and a sign that we all write our own book of life.Manuscript is powerful, dynamic and poetic and is written extremely good!The use of black and white makes it very unique and a film that stands out!Editing is great!Music is extremely good and beautiful!A very clever and intelligent film, with a very good plot twist! A extremely good psychological thriller and amazingly well made!One of the best psychological thrillers ive ever seen!I really recommend it and a must watch if you are a fan of Nolan!"
"Review of Following : I gave this film a 9 because of how incredible it turned out to be despite its limitations in budget and production.No special effects or gimmicks. No fancy lighting or high-budgeted shoot locations. Just a good story to be told and a masterful way of storytelling. That's the heart of this film.I specially enjoyed the non-linear storytelling. I paid close attention to the film as soon as I realized this, and boy, as I reached the ending, everything that happened in the first few parts of the film just made sense.Some of the acting looks unrealistic such as the beatings and Bill and Cobb's fight scenes, but overall, it is still a great movie!"
"Review of Following : What made me watch the movie - the director's name. Though I first saw Prestige first and later Inception and Dark Knight, I realized that all of the movies that blew my mind were made by Nolan. So I hunted down his debut film.What I liked about the movie - intelligent, daring story and the art of budget movie makingThis movie is a premonition of the Nolan brand of movie makingWho will I recommend the movie to - a mystery buffWhat did the movie teach me - maybe there can be a class in anything you do. Perfection is not limited to just art or science. It could be even in the way you walk.#OMAAT One Movie At A TimeHere, the word 'movie' refers to both movies and series."
"Review of Following : While the greatest of journeys begin with the first short step, it is the hallmark of legends in the making that their brilliance shines through distinctly from the crowd even in those nascent steps. Such is the case of Following, the feature directorial debut of Christopher Nolan who is reckoned among best filmmakers of our, nay, all times. Before Nolan emerged as the master of the big budget brainy / psychological thrillers, he began his career with a spartan debut film which, despite its minimal settings, served as the harbinger of the great things to follow.Following tells us the story of Bill (Jeremy Theobald), a young wannabe writer in London, who obsessively follows random people, supposedly to research / find a spark to kindle his writing. He makes stringent rules for himself on this activity which borders on a voyeuristic pursuit as to who to follow, for how long, etc. It is in the course of one such random pursuit he follows the charismatic Cobb (Alex Haw - (does the name of the character ring a dreamy bell deep in your mind ??)), a burglar and gets drawn to him when he discovers they share a similar passion for following strangers.Cobb persuades Bill to accompany him as an understudy during his serial burgling expeditions. Despite being a burglar, Cobb shows minimal interest in his victim's belongings and rather, appears to revel in the shock and awe of his victims when they return to find their residence burgled. Enamored by Cobb's attitude and style, Bill's lifestyle undergoes a sea change as he dives deep into what he finds as an adventurous new world. When an enigmatic blonde, a violent gangster, a murder and some blackmailing are added to the proceedings, we have a potent recipe for a thrill-ride.Being a debut feature, Nolan did not have the luxury of any big studio funding which enabled his mega projects like the The Dark Knight series, Inception or Interstellar. Yet, operating in a shoe-string budget of roughly $6000, Nolan donned multiple hats as the writer, director, cinematographer, editor, and producer of this movie which he completed over the course almost a year as mainly weekends project with the home of his parents as the principal location. His actors, who had other weekday assignments, were put through a drill of rehearsals spanning six months before the filming could commence which is evident from their convincing performances. Nolan shows early symptoms of what is now his signature style elements of intrigue, non-linear narratives, dives into the depths of darkness inherent in human nature, crisscrossing chronologies which peel away at the mystery layer by, carefully constructed, layer even as he teases the viewer to guess and second guess with an engaging screenplay. Nolan's masterclass is evident all through as he constructs a captivating noir in elegant monochrome frames with some nifty hand-held shots.Clocking a crisp length of seventy minutes, this engrossing thriller is the earliest gem from a master when he chose to step out of the shadows."
"Review of Following : It is crazy how amazing christopher nolan is. this was his first movie, written, directed and shot by him. in black and white with 4:3 dimensions. this is the definition of a low budget film ($6k). a phenomenal, clever, creative story. (3 viewings)"
"Review of Following : Definitely a pre-""Memento"" film for Nolan (even the music was the same . . . or at least by the same person). Kind of a Sisyphus method of getting a story across, but it definitely worked for me. Makes me wonder if ""Inception"" will see Nolan return to these roots, utilize his ""Batman"" skills or combine the two. I have a feeling that it's the last option."
"Review of Following : Nolan's movies seem to often involve two rival men playing cat and mouse with each-other (most obviously The Prestige but also the Batman films and Insomnia, the rest not as literally but still thematically). It becomes ambiguous as to who is chasing who. They push each-other to extremes and end up going in circles, forget what they cared about so much, wonder where their morals have gone. They eventually realise they're kind of just chasing themselves. What have they become? How did they end up in this mess? There are always twists and lies. They often end up being quite self-destructive and are left wondering how they got this way. The characters reflect back on what's happened and see things in a whole different light. Ultimately we find where the two men differ, some small indestructible principle they each carry with them.His movies always probe the mind, human nature. They're about trust, memories, manipulation, guilt and anger, the way our decisions affect us over time, the way we lie to ourselves and try to keep our belief system intact. He questions why we do things, why we feel so certain about ourselves and then keeps showing us things that make it clear how little we really know. It's like with magic, we only get tricked because of our own incorrect assumptions and we make them all the time, automatically. Is that really a normal pack of cards? Has he swapped it at any stage? Is this person really my friend? Can I believe anything they say?There are interesting similarities to Memento, particularly the fact that the story has a non-linear timeline (a technique made famous in Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects). It's also in black and white and the main character is a bit neurotic and we hear his inner monologue. There are physical changes that make it clear where we are in time although following it all (accidental pun) can be tricky. And it's presented in a logical order that increases the tension as we gradually learn more about who did what and why.It's short but engaging and satisfying nevertheless. For $6000, it's pretty impressive. The acting is fine but could be better. The characters only focus on each-other, like they know they're in a movie. You don't sense as much of an outside world - there's not much reference to family or friends or the past. Maybe that's deliberate but it feels slightly limiting and unrealistic.Cobb in Inception is probably named after the character identically named here. They are both thieves and invade people's privacy, possibly with indirectly benevolent intentions. They are analytical, for them the human mind is a machine with curious habits on which they are experts.By the end, we can make multiple interpretations, it's left quite open. If you have no evidence of something, did it really exist? It also shows the danger of curiosity. We think we have control but we can easily get addicted. We're immediately vulnerable if we're fascinated by something. It can be used against us. Like a mouse going for cheese not realising what awaits him."
"Review of Following : The debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured, if limited, stab at the con game and obsession.  Filmed for zero money, Nolan couldn't have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of London to ply his trade, given the lack of funds.  This short (67 min) is at its best in playing with the audience's and protagonist's expectations about who is scamming whom, though the initial set-up does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept. The muddy cinematography (he often used natural lighting due to budget) can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization, though the limitations do show at times.One can easily see Nolan's style developing in this fledgling effort; many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in MEMENTO and INSOMNIA.  Not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and Nolan fans."
"Review of Following : After watching Memento one might well wonder how Christopher Nolan pulled off something that audacious, that brilliant, in what was his major directorial debut. Watch Following, the no-budget thriller which was Nolan's actual directorial debut, and you begin to understand. With no money, with an amateur cast and doing pretty much everything (writing, shooting, directing) himself Nolan created a little masterpiece. Whatever ""it"" is that enables someone to make great movies Nolan clearly has it. And had it right from the beginning.Fans of Memento will see a lot of similarities, hints of what was to come, in Following. The most obvious parallel is the nonlinear time structure as the story here unfolds completely out of order. Whereas the story in Memento proceeded more or less in a straight line which just happened to be moving backwards here there is no line at all. Scenes are placed in a seemingly random order. We're all over the place. At the end, in the beginning, somewhere in the middle, back to the end again...it really could have been a jumbled mess. But Nolan gives us a little assistance in orienting ourselves with the shifting appearance of his main character. He has three distinct looks to him and once you figure that out you can figure out where you are in the story. But there are still enough twists and turns to make your head spin, to keep you guessing right up to the end.The less said about the plot the better. Best to let you try to piece the puzzle together for yourself. Much like Memento you really have to see it all the way through to fully appreciate the true genius of it, to understand how any missteps from Nolan along the way could have unraveled his whole story. When the movie concludes you can't help but be amazed that Nolan could pull this off essentially by himself. At least with Memento he had a little help. Here it's just Nolan and his small cast. There are really only three roles of any significance in the film, maybe four if you're being generous. But this little troupe and their first-time director combined to create something really special. The acting may at times seem a bit amateurish but that has to be expected from performers who are certainly not acting pros. And any little quibbles with the performances do not detract at all from the overall movie-watching experience. The actors do more than well enough to get by, well enough in fact that you're surprised there were not bigger acting roles for them somewhere down the line if they wanted them. That the performers have a great story to work with certainly helped their cause.Things do get a little convoluted in the end as Nolan's story takes its final turns. You worry that things may be getting away from him a little bit. But he manages to ultimately pull it all together. You may have to really think about it after things are through but it all makes sense when you run it back in your mind. And it's nice every now and again to have a movie that actually requires you to think isn't it? Christopher Nolan seems to specialize in movies like that. He just makes great movies. Here he did it with no money, all on his own, never having made a movie before. It takes a special talent to pull that off. And among his many talents Nolan also apparently possesses the ability to see into his own future. When you watch Following note the Batman logo on the main character's apartment door."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan's first directorial effort, a year before he did ""Memento,"" and this is almost as brilliant as that classic.  He uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell his story, and it's a very clever one.Bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about.  One day, he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what he's up to.  Cobb is a burglar and he takes Bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes.  Both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them. But there's an ulterior motive for Cobb nurturing this relationship, and it all ties in very smartly at the end.  No, I won't spoil it but this is a very cool movie and I'm beginning to think Christopher Nolan is a genius.If you like suspense films with surprise endings, this one is a must see."
"Review of Following : I just finished watching Following and I thought it was great. I rated it 8 out of 10. I plan on watching it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order.I rented this movie because of my fascination of Christopher Nolan's more recent movie Memento. Following has some similarities; this movie was probably the blueprint for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar.Shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. The story and dialogue is really good. The performance of the actors is believable.Christopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget. I look forward to his next release Insomnia, a big budget movie with my favourite actor Al Pacino."
"Review of Following : Great film. No gratuitous gimmicks like in most Hollywood films. Everything supported the suspense of the plot. B&w gave it a basic, no-frills feel also. In short, it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and cast.Following serves as an interesting contrast to Memento. Characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively. In that sense, both reminded me somewhat of ""In the Company of Men,"" also highly recommendable. One difference between Nolan's two films is that Memento was a little easier for me to follow, given that the b&w scenes progress in a constant chronological direction, and so do those in color. I don't think that was true of Following, where scenes seemed to be shown at random. If you have the choice between VCR and DVD, I'd highly recommend DVD, since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in chronological order, not just in the scrambled (albeit ingenuous) order presented by Nolan. It also makes it easier, upon a second viewing, to piece the order together for yourself, if you want to.As another viewer noted, one of the best things about both this movie and Memento is that none of the cast were famous. They were characters, not big-name actors who brought in personas developed in other movies.Given certain similarities in the plots, I wonder if Memento is sort of a remake of Following, but intended to reach a bigger audience, like Edward Burns made She's the One in the mold of -- and with largely the same cast as -- The Brothers McMullan."
"Review of Following : In this intriguing noir thriller (looking like the Forties, but with a  psychology befitting the Nineties), Director Christopher Nolan employs  a number of techniques he would perfect in his internationally  acclaimed Memento (2000), most notably scenes presented out of time  sequence for effect, and a naive protagonist taken advantage of by  others.  The film opens with ""Bill, the Innocent"" (as I might dub him), played  by Jeremy Theobald, trying to explain to someone, perhaps a social  worker, perhaps even a police inspector (John Nolan), why he took up  following people just for the fun of it. He doesn't just follow women,  he points out.  He's not a stalker, as such. He's just curious. He's an intriguing and  sympathetic character, a Brit writer with a lot of time on his hands  who seems something of a throwback to an earlier age with his clanking  manual typewriter and the photo of a pursed-lips Marilyn Monroe on the  wall of his shabby apartment.  Things began to go wrong for him, he further explains, when he broke  some of his ""following rules"" and got too close to his prey. What he  doesn't know and what we don't know yet, is that his clumsy following  technique has allowed him to unwittingly become the followed himself.  Enter a juicy blonde (Lucy Russell) walking down some steps from her  apartment. (This scene is out of sequence as far as chronological time  goes, but psychologically speaking, her appearance signals his  entanglement). Enter now a scheming, sophisticated psychopathic  thrill-seeker named Cobb (Alex Haw) who entices Bill with his  (apparent) practice of burglary just for the powerful feeling one gets  from invading the sanctity of another's life.  Although justification for the temporal inversions here is not as  clearly established as in Memento, nonetheless the technique works  well, and Nolan provides us with a clever ending that sneaks up on us  and makes in a few seconds all that went before clear. Or mostly clear.  You might want to rewind and view the first few minutes of the film,  and then everything should be clarity.  This low-budget, black and white, deliciously ironic little film (71  minutes) marked the auspicious debut of a film maker who has already  made quite a name for himself, not only with the aforementioned  Memento, but with Insomnia (2002). It will be interesting to see what  Nolan does next."
"Review of Following : Following (1998) :
Brief Review -The begining of Nolan Era. The best possible start to the Legacy Nolan carries today. Following is overwhelming, yes it is. Not because of soft corner that it was a begining of One of the Best Director of today's time but because it is better than contemporary thrillers of hollywood. If there were mind shaking thrillers like 'Fight Club' and 'The Sixth Sense' in year 1999 then 'Following' was similar mind shaking stuff an year ago but never got enough recognition. The film is about A young writer who follows strangers for material meets a thief who takes him under his wing. In just 70 minutes Following defines all proportions of a perfect thriller what we have seen from Hitchcock till modern Hollywood. The narrative is told in black and white and inexpensive way which should have been a disadvantage but actually it works like an additional advantage. The grip is tight of course because of small runtime but having only 3 characters in the narrative and then completing a story as it was planted by someone who didn't really have any focuse in the narrative is simply amazing. This sense and vision of storytelling by Nolan was something to follow and we have seen similar formulas used by him in almost all his classic films over the years. What i love the most about Nolan is he is capable to bring a new and creative storyline and then finish it off in unexpected and unpredictable manners (except for Insomnia). There is nothing much to talk about actors not because they are not good enough but because this narrative is all about writing, storytelling, cinematography and direction and all these fields are handled by one man, Mr. Christopher Nolan. Now i am done with Nolan's filmography and if i have to tell the Most Underrated film of his career then it would be Following without any second thoughts.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest"
"Review of Following : Following was a nicely paced, sparse movie.  There weren't any superfluous scenes.  It told an engaging story with a minimum of fuss.  I enjoyed it. If you want to watch a good film-noirish type movie you can't go wrong with this one.  Well worth the time."
Review of Following : Asusal nolan rocks...i had watched only one time soo i dont deserve to rating or review this movie...miles to go away to review this movie...
"Review of Following : A clever method of Storytelling or a gimmick? Does an adroit way of Editing a film ever become tiresome, intrusive, and showy? When does a ""new"" innovation in Movie-Making become clich√©d? These are the types of questions one might ask about the work of Christopher Nolan.He now uses this time-shifting Editing technique quite often and is the centerpiece of his Cult Film Memento (2000). In His first attempt at a feature length Film it is obvious that he not only liked this off beat way of delivering a Story but actually fell in love with it later on.Some might find this kind of indulgence pretentious and unnecessary and yes, a gimmick. That's a cheap shot, but it is a cheap way of manipulating the Audience with a shake up of continuity and is quite awkward and one could say it breaks the fourth wall.This very low budget Movie is quite impressive and it is engaging, well Acted, and the on the job training Camera-Work is excellent. The Story is impressive and the Dialog is interesting and sincere. Fans of low budget Movies will love it and Fans of the Director will rave about its embryonic eccentricities."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan is one of the most popular and celebrated director, making films like Memento, Inception and of course The Dark Knight Trilogy. But every director has to start someone and Nolan was with the very low budget, but very well made Following.In London, a young man, Lee (Jeremy Theobald) is a struggling writer who follows random people just to see where they go, doing it for research for his book. But one well-dressed person he follows, Cobb (Alex Haw), turns out to be a burglar and Lee becomes his partner in crime. But Lee slowly gets sucked up into the London underworld when he befriends one of his victims (Lucy Russell).Following is a very low budget film; it was made on a budget of ¬£6000 and it Nolan over a year to make it. Following was still a very well made, taut affair, running in at trim 70 minute and is a film that never drags at any moment. It is compelling film, both as a thriller and early on as a psychological piece, looking at obsession, voyeurism and finding out and creating your own stories about people.Nolan uses a non-linear narrative, similar to Quentin Tarantino films and Memento. The non-linear can be annoying but Nolan uses it to his advantage and allowed for the film to keep the twists and turns coming. If I had to be critical the grand plan is a little convoluted, but Nolan was make the pieces fit with his writing and direction.For a low budget film Following looks good: Nolan uses black and white 16mm film giving the film a distractive look. It is a film that accepts its noir influence but still gives it a more modern, British look, accepting the bleaker landscapes of London like the abandoned building. When music was used it had techno, pumping beat, adding to the tension on the screen.Following is an excellent start to Nolan's career, doing a lot with the limits of his budget. Some of the acting is not as convincing as in his later films, but Following showed what Nolan was capable of and it is his most distinctively British film."
Review of Following : Too bad this 70 min. film didn't see a very broad release--too short for the standard commercial outlets.  It has an entertaining twisty script and fine performances from a cast I was not familiar with.  Very well done black & white cinematography.  I especially enjoyed the musing on what our most trivial possessions say about us to strangers.
"Review of Following : Recently I watched following. It's a very good movie considering of its budget in that time. The idea of shooting movie in black and white was good.Nolan used his typical technique in this movie also like shifting from past to future and vice versa. This gives us a very little information about the movie, and we get engaged throughout the movie.Performance of actor was good. Screenplay was good, I did not get bored while watching the movie. In the end Climax, just say that shocked me. I will not spoil it for u, so you have to go and watch it and trust me you will not get disappointed.It's really an underrated gem of Nolan, give it a try."
"Review of Following : Following is a great debut for Christopher Nolan, especially on such a low budget. A dark tale of voyeurism told in a black and white, non chronological structure that's thoroughly Nolan. Keeping its cards close to its chest until a final reveal that demands repeat viewings.Considering most of the cast aren't professional actors (some have this as their sole credit), they're really good. Jeremy Theobald's uneasy protagonist is an engaging lead as he gets more than he bargained for and Alex Haw gives Cobb a level of charming mystery that makes his threatening presence all the more impactful.It's so impressive how fully formed Nolan's direction is here, even if it over explains a few twists. So many of his common visual and narrative preoccupations are present and he only struggles during the brief action (if it can even be called that). David Julyan's score has a screeching paranoia that's a persistent highlight."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan's 'Following' is an engaging psychological thriller that offers the first glimpse into the director's prowess for complex narratives. This low-budget, black-and-white film is a testament to Nolan's ability to weave a compelling story regardless of scale.'Following' cleverly manipulates time and perspective, a trademark that Nolan would carry into his future works. The non-linear storytelling enhances the suspense and keeps the audience guessing until the very end. The tight pacing and effective use of its lean 70-minute runtime speak volumes about Nolan's skill in maintaining tension.The film's exploration of voyeurism and identity gives it an unexpectedly philosophical edge. While it doesn't have the visual grandeur of Nolan's later films, it makes up for it with an intriguing plot, solid performances, and an immersive atmosphere.In conclusion, 'Following' is a captivating debut feature that promises and delivers. It offers a fascinating look into the early creative mind of one of cinema's most acclaimed directors."
"Review of Following : Nolan again ... what is agreat movie . In the beginning i like to much , i like the main character . How can he follow people, this idea is strange . And lead to alot of secrets . This movie is short and the story usually demand time like this . Movie is considered new but is taken by white and black camera. There are just three main characters and the movie is only around them . Movie will manipulate your thoughts, so don't judge early just see and wait . Movie did not contain any bad content. City is strange and i can't know it . After this movie i like to go for the past to see the old movies and enjoy by that time."
"Review of Following : This was a lot of fun to watch. To see Christopher Nolan's evolution in film is highly enjoyable. Following being a under budget film and his first film at that, still manages to have all the good things that make a Christopher Nolan film (Besides the special effects, score and sound mixing). The acting was solid for an under budget film. Which shocked me at that. The writing was actually really well done. One could argue it's one of his most thoughtful written films. It is very different from his other films and it was fun to see. Overall, while struggling with a small budget. Following still manages to hold your attention with its writing, pacing and scene jumping."
Review of Following : So i was mostly interested by the movie because it was the first movie of Christopher Nolan as a director and i need to say that i really enjoyed it. It dont have big special efrects or CGI like his recent movies; it have some simple shots with few locations and few characters and worked arround during the whole movie. And to be honest i really enjoyed it. Its simple and let the story reveal the complexity and the depth of it. This man who follow another man who is in fact a burglar who just wanted to use the perfect stranger to cover his track and make him accused of a crime that he is suspected. It was pretty surprising to see also the revelations about the blond girl who revealed to be an associate to Cobb and was just make Bill a fool and play with him to get out Cobb of suspicions. It was pretty clever writing and i didnt see things coming; it was pretty unexpected. I enjoyed it and find interesting mostly by the writing and the characters. It have some qualities. The surprises and revelations are there and find the movie pretty good even its pretty simple. I enjoyed it.
"Review of Following : Definitly a Christopher Nolan work you should not skip.After I saw this film, it was still warm inside my brain, I was about to press play on the next when I noticed that this one was still resonating in me. How it planted the necessary ideias to guide us to think and perceive exactly what is expected, just like what happens to the main character.I was still gathering my ideias after I finished it when I realized that this could be a story about a story. Which is the thing I like the most about this film.I recommend it for those who, such as myself, like to gather pieces along the film and watch them come together, but still be puzzled about how it turned out."
"Review of Following : RATED 8/10
Language: English
Source: Nil
RECOMMENDEDWatched this movie because of Nolan. It is a simple crime drama with the usual Nolan's brilliant twist. I felt it meets the expectations.At some point movie becomes bit deviating from the flow, but it all ended up a quite surprising crime.If you want to watch simple suspense thriller, this is the best choice. Very few characters and need to remember their name, as i got confused in between. Sometimes rewind to grasp the scene.Best Advice: don't read any reviews because all reviews will give at least one small hint about the surprise factor in this movie, including mine."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is a really good crime, mystery, thriller.I have to say as someone who doesn't care for low budget indie films I thoroughly enjoyed this. Despite certain moments being corny and rather poor. But these nitpicks aside this film features some solid acting and a well done musical score.However it is the story here what elevates everything, feeling very uniquely Nolan in both substance and presentation.Overall watching it from the perspective of this being Nolan's directorial debut, it was a well done film. Showing to the world Christopher Nolan was and remains a remarkably talented film maker to keep your eye on.IMDb: 8/10
Letterboxd: 4/5Watched on YouTube."
Review of Following : The one that already plays with timelines. Good to see where it all started.
"Review of Following : Well written, great twist in the end but Nolan knew that wasn't enough. His love for time is also here. That hair cut surprised me and I had to return again to connect the dots...Nolan just improves himself, more complex story in future. The only flaws for me would be the restrictions a 6000 dollar movie would have.Performance were great, specially Cobb. His delivery and charm was beautiful. 2 multiple twist came back to back which might be hard to indulge.Ending reminded me of 'Dial M for Murder' where protagonist traps a guy completely from every direction, the perfect murder."
"Review of Following : With (very) low budget, good direction and an ambitious and sophisticated script, Nolan's first film is also one of his best works."
Review of Following : This film was so damm creepy. I love the 4:3 ratio and the blacks and white look. It has the vibe of a 40s film noir. Christopher Nolan first film is proof that you don't need heavy VFX and explosions to tell an interesting story. You just need to have a good story and execution.
"Review of Following : Not one of Nolan's best films (second weakest from personal opinion), but for a debut and for being made on such a low budget much of 'Following' is very impressive. Even if it became much more refined in his later films, there is a sense that Nolan has found his style and not hopelessly trying to find his feet.'Following' isn't perfect. The motivation for the lead female character is very thin, likewise with the character herself and Lucy Russell is a blank acting-wise. The film doesn't get going straight away with a slightly dull first 10 minutes, and there is one or two twist(s) too many which gives the ending a convoluted and contrived feel.However, the production values could have been much worse considering that it was a debut film and that the budget was reminiscent of a miniscule student film budget. Granted, Nolan's visual style became more audacious in later films, and very quickly (the difference in style between 'Following' and his next, and best, film 'Memento' is staggering), but as the way it's shot, lit and composed has much more atmosphere and class than most ""student films"" calling it one seems somewhat of an insult.David Julyan provides a chilling score, that is not as good as his thematically complex one for 'Memento' but on the same level as that for 'Insomnia' and better than the fitting (within the film) forgettable (on its own) one for 'The Prestige'.Apart from the odd stilted moment, the dialogue has many clever and thoughtful ones, and Nolan does a good job directing even if more expansive, ambitious and refined in his later films. The story is interesting and remarkably tight, with very few needless elements, a case of ambition mostly not getting in the way (something that undermined 'Interstellar' and to a lesser extent 'Inception', though those films have many strong elements) until the ending tries to do a little too much.Characters are interesting, being likable but doing not so likable things. The acting is mostly very much committed, with Alex Haw especially being very good and charismatic.On the whole, Nolan went on to do much better things (especially with 'The Dark Knight' trilogy and 'Memento') but 'Following' is not a bad start at all and fares better than some more famous and more influential director's debut films (Kubrick with 'Fear and Desire' for example). 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"Review of Following : Saucy, eh ? If at all you're familiar with Christopher Nolan's style of film-making, watching this will at once make you realize where it all started. Its also of course possible that it began much before this but since much of that material isn't accessible to the public (save Doodlebug), we'll never really know. For all purposes, Following remains Nolan's feature film debut and it surely is a remarkable achievement.The story follows Bill, a struggling unemployed writer who takes a liking to following people in hopes of finding material to write about. This liking soon turns into addiction forcing Bill to set rules to allow him to restrain his activities. One of the rules which he ends up breaking, is following the same person twice. The person with whom this rule is broken is Cobb, who soon confronts Bill about being followed. As it turns out, Cobb is a burglar who enjoys robbing people, not for the money, but rather for the sheer pleasure in taking away things that people took for granted; his belief being that it would make them realize what they had. Taken away by Cobb's lifestyle, Bill becomes a partner in his burglaries which is where the trouble begins.Digging any more into the plot would serve to spoil the complex mystery that Following is. Following has a lot of those narrative structures that would become trademarks of Nolan's directorial style (intercuts, close-up inserts, non-linear editing, multiple chronologies, and so on). Nolan and crew were forced to make certain hard choices to obscure the severely limited budget, one of which was shooting the film in black and white. Of course, the plot was such that these decisions worked the film's favor. The film's incredible naturalism repeatedly comes to mind while watching the film. This is due largely in part to the film being shot hand-held, with scenes filmed in a take or two to save on film stock. The behind the scenes material with the film reveals this and other fascinating details about the film's production such as the crew shooting over weekends due to their jobs on weekdays as a result of which the film took a year to complete.Despite the low budget, you're always hooked on to Following and that is due largely in part to the film's plot and tight writing (another of Nolan's strengths). Unlike many filmmakers who use lavish editing styles and gimmicky display effects, Nolan's films rely primarily on story and screenplay to get the viewers attention (with the occasional non-linear editing thrown in to really keep the audience alert at all times). Add to it, the intriguing characters which have personalities so distinct it appears Nolan himself followed a handful of people to get the traits right. Jeremy Theobald is as natural as the gullible Bill as Alex Haw is suave in the role of Cobb. And the chemistry between the two is so natural, it makes most of the dialogues they say seem improvised, as though real people were conversing.Following is a great start for Nolan who has now moved on to bigger, elaborate and definitely better projects. It is a lesson for aspiring filmmakers that even with a limited budget, it is possible to make a feature as interesting, riveting and thrilling as some of the best noirs of the early 40s. While it may not be perfect, most of the limitations it suffers from are largely due to production values rather than plotting and pacing. It is nevertheless, a must watch for anyone who has even the slightest of respect for Christopher Nolan's film-making.Overall Score: 7.0 / 10"
"Review of Following : Following 9-29-08Every narrative film needs that hook...that undefinable something that will keep your butt in the seat till the credits roll. Its the one thing any remotely ""good"" film has to do. Following's non-linear structure interestingly enough had me hooked nearly immediately. The film begins with a clean cut looking fella dressed nicely then flashes back and we see the same character now looking rather bohemian....another jump involves our hero lying on the ground having been beaten with a rubber glove shoved in his mouth. These sorts of jumps in the narrative arc of the character occur frequently throughout the film. Begging one to ask how did these future events occur and why? Following's structural approach gives us a narrative that is much greater than the sum of its parts."
"Review of Following : As a starting point it's a decent neo-noir flick.
Nolan had to start somewhere and it was quite a unique start indeed."
"Review of Following : Following is the directorial debut of Christopher Nolan. As it was made on almost no budget with unprofessional actors, I was not expecting much. The protagonist is a young writer who has resorted to stalking people that he finds interesting so as to pass his time. On one particular day, the guy that he was stalking confronted him and questioned the reason for why he was stalking. Both of them begin to break into other people's home and just try to guess the type of people that lived there.Despite the lack of professional actors, it never feels as if the acting is poor due to the well rehearsed scenes. According to Nolan, all of them had rehearsed every scene so well that the majority of the movie had scenes which were filmed in the first or second take.To make a movie without any distributor is courageous and a bit of a gamble. However, Nolan took the risk and today he is among the most well known directors in the world. Do not go into this movie for viewing a technical masterpiece because it isn't. However, if you are looking for a compelling story with a stellar ending, this movie is right for you."
"Review of Following : A solid and compelling story throughout with its fair share of twists and turns. The acting is passable, however, some scenes were quite amateurish. The characters sufficed, although one of the main character's intentions and motives were left rather unknown. Even though multiple perspectives are given, some only features the protagonist's recollection, thus making the other characters too unknown to find the conclusion fulfilling. Hence, why there might be even more questions unanswered after the movie ends."
"Review of Following : This British thriller is a complete journey at a brief 69 minutes, with no skimping on substance, and no wasted time. A black-and-white noir, Christopher Nolan's ""Following"" is a no-budget picture that feels seamless and utilizes elements of deception and shifting time frames. Jeremy Theobald (Bill) likes to pick strangers out of a crowd and follow them around the streets of London, learning what he can about the details of their lives. Bill's voyeurism becomes dangerous when he starts tailing a thief. Mr. Cobb (Alex Haw), a smooth-talking cat-burglar who also likes to peek inside people's lives, through his m.o. leans to breaking and entering.""Following"" has an interesting narrative strategy. It leaps forward into the future and doubles back to show the past. It's a strategy that one would not expect to find in such a low-budget film. It means that the director, who didn't have money to shoot every little thing he could think of, had to conceive of the strategy and trust that it would work once he put the film together. There are enough twists here which spins the film into a dizzying crescendo, where loose ends begin to come together, and the brilliance of the stellar story start to shine through.Nolan is involved in every stage of production, from writing to shooting, producing and directing. Brief, but intelligent--and his precursor to ""Momento""--gives us just a sampling of things to come, and he has yet to misfire."
"Review of Following : Following was a nifty, little noir-ish film. Nothing more, nothing less. The acting was pleasantly good across the board. The lack of big name actors/actresses is icing on the cake; no alter egos from other films are unintentionally commingled. The characters are truly the characters. The film is shot in black and white. Combined with the photography, the film clearly suggests a noir influence. While this is somewhat suiting for the circumstances of the main character, it leaves the cinematography feeling rather uncreative. (Nolan actually admitted to using black and white initially because of his limited equipment. He worked with it, and headed in a noir direction for an unconfused look. Due to the circumstances, I won't hold it against him.)Unfortunately, this movie falls short in the writing. This is a Nolan film and is pieced together in Nolan's trademark style: simultaneously presented sequences of a central plot that differ with respect to time and converge at some point in the movie. Nolan used the same kind of video editing in Memento, but in a way that's much more clear cut and purposeful. Following is no more than the presentation of a brilliant concept, not yet made to work. Yes, Following was very low budget. Yes, it's Nolan's first real movie. You'll want to hold back on the harsh criticism you'd give movies of a higher budget or more experienced director, but frankly; these factors don't really play into the film's conspicuous flaws. The directing was excellent, but the story (after it's untangled) is nothing more than just that: a story.See this film if you're a die-hard Nolan fan, it's nothing special otherwise."
"Review of Following : Proof that a micro-budget is no limitation to the production of a good film - all you need is ideas and verve, a truism that more tyros might heed. Even those elements here that might be considered flawed by 'budgetary limitations' - the sometimes uncertain camerawork, the limited locations, the lack of extras etc. - on the contrary add to this thriller, give it a dream feel where the lead character has no control over his actions, keeps returning to the same places, trapped in someone  design, both literally, in space, and in terms of fiendishly conceived plot.Heavily influenced by THE USUAL SUSPECTS, the first signal of breach is the voiceover, which begins with the usual, voice-of-god, this-is-what-really-happened, honest-guv authority, but is broken by a second voice, which questions it, undermines it.  Already, the lead character's voice is undermined, and, as everything we see proceeds from his voice, so is the narrative.  The plot therefore works on three levels - on the level of the story as the Young Man tells it; on the more Proustian level, where chronological order is not observed, like you would tell a story to friend, leaping all over the shop; the 'real' level, where the master puppeteer finally reveals his strings.Before the thriller proper starts, there is a welcome prologue that places FOLLOWING in a different mode altogether, , one more indebted to Hitchcock, Powell, Poe, Benjamin, Baudelaire, Marker, Keiller.  The Young Man, ostensibly a writer gathering material, or 'between jobs' as Cobb notes with cruel accuracy, takes to following random people, not for sexual kicks, just to see what they do, where they live.  This opens up a fascinating series of questions about alienation, voyeurism, urban solitude, decentring, the attempt to connect.  The invading of people's lives, the assuming of identities, all of which are ingeniously put into practice in the crime narrative.  There is a Benjaminian concern with dead urban spaces, those places, apartments, abandoned restaurants etc., that dot London (and presumably other large cities), uninhabited , transitory stopovers for flaneurs, malevolent ghosts.Because in one way this is a ghost story, about people inhabiting other people's spaces, identities, minds, leaving unfathomable marks, traces. There is an obsession with objects, trinkets, rememberances, as if all this will somehow make substantial the transitory.  This extends to the Young Man, who inhabits a plot that doesn't exist, and absorbs traces of Cobb, his personality, his look, even his girlfriend, until he literally ceases to be himself, an empty receptacle waiting to be used, someone outside society about to be hung for someone else's traces.One shouldn't forget that the film is brilliantly plotted as a thriller, and the chronological leaps are hilarious (in that what 'follows' clears up what went before, though technically after, not always as we'd expect, but also undermining characters' sense of agency, and creating a sense of menace, of not being grounded, not being in control that extends to the audience as well as the Young Man.  The idea of a master 'author' writing the fiction, juggling his unwitting characters, brings to mind Welles, and there is the extraordinary central set-piece, blackly comic, where the Young Man goes to get the photographs; this is troublingly Wellesian, as he enters a realm with objects which seem to dissolve before him into an engulfing heart of darkness.  In one way, the film is an anti-detective film, full of clues, 'following' and incidents to interpret, but rather than solving the crime or conspiracy, the detective becomes fatally enmeshed.As I suggested, the film is liberated, rather than constrained, by budget. So if it has flaws, than they are a result of conception.  The first isn't really serious - the likeable actors become increasingly monotonous - when characters who aren't really expressive, but try to be, it can get a bit tiresome - surely Bressonian passivity is more appropriate.  There is perhaps a misogyny in the character of the Blonde, in keeping with the old film noir triangle structure, although the deliberate framing and lighting of her as a 40s siren with an arch London accent suggests parody.  More serious is the resolution, which ultimately backs away from the ambiguity of THE USUAL SUSPECTS, providing a clear-cut, if clever, denouement, having worked so hard at enigma.  Never mind, this is still a remarkable debut, showing there's life in the old genre yet."
"Review of Following : It is fascinating to recognise, retrospectively, the presence from his debut feature length film of the aspects that would define (for better or worse, depending on the movie) the narrative interests of Nolan's career so far. But, more particularly, the elements that structure his following movie (and what I still consider his best work so far).The way Nolan mixes separate timelines, that we understand will eventually intertwine, without any revelation of how they connect until the narrative evolves sufficiently for us to realise it. This is the core narrative mechanic the director would utilise masterfully on Memento, stating this movie almost as a test run for what he could accomplish given a bit more time and budget.Far from perfect, it has the need for that revealing moment of the final twist through direct exposition, where all the subtle reveals Nolan manages to accomplish with the split timeline give way to a more obvious revelation. It serves a (not entirely satisfying) proposition for the audience to question some of the occurring events, that already found in the character's lack of complete knowledge of one another sufficient material to keep us guessing.In the end, it is nevertheless an interesting experience, where even the director, constrained by the lack of budget, takes advantage of a black and white cinematography full of great contrasts, that contribute to the eeriness of the plot and its inhabiting characters."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan's micro-budget feature debut is a taught noir thriller that wisely relies on an excellent screenplay rather than expensive spectacle and, as such, proves that you don't need a budget to tell a good story. 'Following (1998)' really is phenomenal considering the money, and schedule, it was made on. It is a suspenseful and engaging tale that shows all the signs of what a great director Nolan would go on to become. A fantastic debut and a better film than many a director's second, third even fifteenth outing. 7/10"
"Review of Following : Most people now know Christopher Nolan's name from his involvement with the Batman reboot. Others may remember him from Inception or Memento, where his scripts bent minds with their wonderful weirdness.Following is his first ever effort at proper film-making. It features amateur actors who filmed their scenes while not at their day jobs, black and white footage and all filmed, written and directed by Christopher Nolan. In short, it comes across a bit like an 'art house' flick when you put it like that. But is it any good? Yes.Considering its minimal budget and lack of film-making expertise, it's pretty damn amazing. If you can forgive the lack of Hollywood glitz and grainy, student-like footage, it's a very compelling story which exhibits many traits which Christopher Nolan has used again (and expanded on) in his upcoming features.It's about a man who, needing inspiration for characters he's writing about, starts following random strangers around London in order to get some idea what 'normal' people do. However, what he doesn't bank on is when a suave thief who he follows catches him in the act and confronts him about it. Together they form an uneasy alliance and things take more than one turn for the worse. I'll keep the plot vague as it's one of those films that you can only really watch once and enjoy not knowing where it's going. I'll leave the surprises a surprise.If you can put up with a film that's very raw and rugged, devoid of anything vaguely Hollywood, plus you like a bit of a mind-bender which will have you guessing until the end, give this a go. Even if you completely hate it, it's pretty short, weighing in at just over an hour.Also, note the coincidental Batman logo on a flat door - a prediction of things to come? http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"Review of Following : The narrator, a writer, admits to being lonely and bored.. when he starts following random people. Although he calls it ""shadowing"" at first...which may be less surreptitious in his own mind. And he had rules, at first. But he admits when he started breaking his own rules, that's when the troubles started. Although he tells people he's between jobs. So which is it? Is he a writer or not? And when he gets caught by cobb, a cat burglar, they start breaking into apartments together. Of course they will get caught eventually. Can they come up with a good enough story to get out of this mess? It's a study of cat burglers, pushing their luck. And getting caught up in bigger crimes. Some twists and turns. Done in black and white, to add to the mystique. Written and directed by christopher nolan. But it's a family project... his wife and his uncle are in it as well! This was nolan's first, full length feature film. He recently won two oscars for oppenheimer. And was nominated for more along the way."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan is my favorite director, and Inception is my favorite film of all time. Oppenheimer will open in a few days, and what better way to prepare for that than watching his directorial debut twice in one weekend?One of the things that I love about his best movies is that I enjoy them even more the second, third and even fourth time that I watch them. Inception, Tenet, Interstellar and Memento all include a wealth of details that escaped me the first time that I saw them.There is some of that in Following as well, but not as pronounced. Although it is a spectacular debut (and it is), it is still a debut. Christopher Nolan has certainly evolved since he made Following, and anything else would not only be surprising, but actually quite sad. As any great artist, he has found and honed his voice over time.The grainy black and white of Following makes me think of Anton Corbijn and his iconic music videos for Depeche Mode and U2. The non-linear storytelling had been all the rage since Quentin Tarantino made Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction a few years earlier. While Christopher Nolan abandoned the grainy black and white, he took the non-linear storytelling even further in Memento. I do feel, however, that his choice of non-linear storytelling wasn't just a trendy thing that he forced onto these movies. In Memento it gives a sense of how the protagonist himself perceives reality, and in his debut it delays our understanding of the story, increasing the suspense and thus our enjoyment.I highly recommend that you see this film. It is a testament to what true talent can achieve despite very limited resources. Considering all the praise his debut received, I think it's fair to say that Christopher Nolan started building a fan base already back in 1998, a following in fact."
"Review of Following : Interesting fact about this movie:
-Christopher Nolan came up with the idea for the film because he had his home broken into and wondered what the people thought as they went around looking at his belongings.Review:
7.4/10
To be fair, it wasn't that bad but it was pretty ok for a first Christopher Nolan film it kinda made more sense after watching it.Starting with the cinematography, yeah it was very good for a first movie kinda beautiful and amazing in my first watch but it was just a casual you can literally find in every first movie made by a teenager or a fil student. But the best one for a Christopher Nolan film but for a first one it was very good.I can't say I liked the casting of this particular movie neither their acting they simply served the plot and kimda helped the viewer truly understand the characters of this movie...by the way I hope I'm not the only one but why Cobb(played by Alex Haw) sounded and acted exactly like Patrick Bateman from American Psycho?...I kinda liked this movie and I was kinda hooked on it from the beginning until the end of it and had a fun time watching it. Also,the writing of it was very good and kinda interesting. I honestly liked it and kinda gave the actual beginning of Christopher Nolan's career in the whole filn industry.The plot was cool nothing way too complicated just house thieves stealing things and money with actual meaning to the owners,which I have to admit is not something you can possibly admire but for a 1 hour and maybe 10 minutes of a filn it was very good and kinda helped the movie not getting too boring.Th environments and also the soundtrack were nothing way too amazing just casual environments woth a simple melody nothing way too noticeable but yeah they only helped the plot and the movie moving forward to the end of it.The ending was literally wow unexpected and also mind-blowing if you rewatch it you kinda see every action from the characters woth a different perspective and that's actually a very common thing I actually like in every Christopher Nolan film,the rewatchability every movie of him has.To summarize,""Following"" even tho it was Christopher Nolan first actual movie and not a short one is actually good and cool rewatchable tho but not very interesting comparing to the rest of his filmography."
"Review of Following : To think this was his first feature length film and was filmed on $6,000 is incredible.Is it an amazing film? No but it is very good.The thing that makes him stand out as a director is evident in this as he makes not great actors, no effects, black and white dingey scenes hook you in and make you nervous and fully invested.The amazing aspect of the film is the story. It is so clever when explained at the end and is an early glimpse of his brilliance that we now know.If I could give 7.5/10 I would but that is when taking into account inexperience and budget which I think is fair as it can't compete with blockbusters."
"Review of Following : First I have to make it clear that I'm not a fan of Christophal Nolen and it's not one of my top 10 directors, but after watching this movie twice, I'm really impressed, well let's start the discussion about the movie
The story of the film is very excellent and interesting, and we can consider this film as evidence that a professional director does not need Heitvan Heitma, Hans Zimmer, Leonardo DiCaprio, or I Max camera to make a very good movie.In the middle of the movie we found out. Surprise and Twist in great events, and I saw that it was one of the negatives of the movie that it showed us the Twist of his plot since its half and not the end, but then in the end, when we saw the greatest and biggest Twist, I felt an astonishment that I have not known for a long time, I can say with confidence My surprise at the end of this movie is the same, and perhaps even more so than my surprise at the end of The Pristege.Very good performances from all the cast
Well here are three features:
1 story
2 The Twist
3 acting
But the film also has three major flaws...or rather four,
The music is bad, we can't say it's average, it's very bad, the composer for the movie is David Julian, he is also the composer of Memento, Insomnia and The Prestige
These three films you mentioned have very good music
But the following's music....so awful
The second negative is the action scenes, well, maybe the next two negatives, I can't say it's Nolen's problem, because he didn't have the potential to do better than that. But this negativity, I don't expect it to be related to production, I think he could have made better clash scenes than these....kind of funny
As for the next two negatives: the lighting, and this is a logical thing because he did not have the ability to bear the cost of lighting and the people responsible for it, but in fact there are some scenes that were in dark places, I could not see where Bill was originally, and the last negative is the randomness of the frames, Nolen was He goes to the shooting location and starts shooting the script without any preparation for the staff location and without replays of scenes more than twice, but I can understand it because this is Nolin's first movie, and it is not required to be on the level of Inciption or The Dark Knight
But, I had so much fun watching it, and it left me in a big shock after the end."
"Review of Following : One the Lowest Nolan movies but ... but a good and respectable movie with very few budget
Totally worth watching."
"Review of Following : This is the rougher form of manipulation and time jumping that Nolan would use to greater effect in Memento, making this almost feel like a practice run for his real breakout film. That being said, Following, the tiny $6,000 movie Nolan made on weekends for a year is still a fun neo-noir that manages to use its fractured structure to effectively deliver an entertaining experience that, while unrefined, still shows real promise. It reminds me of Kubrick's Fear and Desire in terms of look and production methods, though Nolan started off on a far stronger foot than the late master.The story is about a young, aimless wannabe writer, Bill, who starts following random people on the street to fill his days. He's careful about it at first, following a certain set of rules that he steadily begins to break until confronted by one of his targets, a man named Cobb. Cobb is a burglar who approaches his work with a philosophical bent, using his criminal acts in a way to drive the people he burgles into reconsidering their lives through their relationship to the things that he disturbs and takes. This form of voyeurism obviously has an appeal to the voyeuristic Bill who ends up taking up Cobb's mission as his own.Told out of sequence, the structure often ends up feeling a bit random, flipping through about four different time periods, Bill's confession to the police at the end, his meeting and early apprenticeship with Cobb, his dating with the Blonde whom they robbed, and his burglary of a club owned by the Blonde's gangster ex-boyfriend. The intercutting doesn't often inform one element to the next, and the placement of scenes seems haphazard most of the time rather than intentional until the ending, which is actually cut together really well. There's also an emotional void at the center of this film, and I think it has something to do with the movie's brevity.Following is a grand 70 minutes long, and it never feels like a shortened idea stretched too far. It actually feels like an idea properly fitted towards a shorter feature length rather than the bare-minimum for the classification that's been cut a bit short. The missing bits should have come from the relationship between Bill and the Blonde. It doesn't really matter that we don't know her name, but the problem is that their relationship feels barely formed by the time double-crosses and betrayals start happening. She's not some femme fatale of the classic noir films, at least she's not built that way in the movie, but she feels like a girl caught up in Bill and Cobb's trap that Bill ends up manipulating towards his own personal ends by pursing a relationship with her. However, their relationship never feels terribly real, and the thinness robs the later double cross of any emotional power. Another 10-15 minutes just making that relationship feel alive could have been what this movie needed to be in order to transform from a solid directorial debut into something more special.That being said, this movie does look and feel like a production done with the barest of shoestring budgets. Handheld camera work, black and white film stock, and very simple camera coverage setups seem derived from an effort to get as much footage as possible on a given Saturday rather than to help visualize the story in a cinematic way. It's brutal and efficient, and probably the best Nolan could do under the circumstances. His focus was the structure of the editing and script, of course, those things that he could offer something new on rather than on the actual production with only $6,000 and the good graces of those involved.All that being said, the ending is really quite satisfying as we watch Nolan bring together the different puzzle pieces. Bill has been set up from the beginning, and the cross-cutting between the Blonde's final moments with Cobb and the resolution of Bill's interview with the police provide the same kind of new color to the rest of the film that Memento's ending did. However, because of the inelegance of most of the movie's cross-cutting and the thin nature of Bill's relationship with the Blonde, it has a muted impact beyond the thrill of seeing interconnecting pieces thrown together snugly.As a debut feature, Following shows much promise. It's intelligently written with an eye towards a specific ending, though the emotional impact is limited and some of the early editing choices lend themselves to confusion more than anything else. However, because the ending feels so satisfying, despite lacking the kind of gut punch one might expect from some of the revelations, it papers over most of the earlier hiccups and wraps up the film with a nice sense of flair."
"Review of Following : Exciting thriller based on film noire with which Christopher Nolan makes his debut. In some thriller elements a bit too exaggerated and the character drawings are repeated in some places, but a good film that was properly implemented with limited resources.7,0"
"Review of Following : I'm filling in some Christopher Nolan blanks while we wait for Tenet. This was his directorial feature debut. It's wonderfully lo-fi. Graded in grainy black and white and shot mostly hand held, it's got a voyeuristic feel. Jeremy Theobold, credited as 'The Young Man' (he has no name) likes to follow people. To see where they go. He's explaining this pastime to 'The Policeman' (John Nolan... uncle in case you were wondering), which suggests something may have gone wrong, although we'll have to be patient to find out what. He's a nice guy though it seems, he has rules, although freely admits to breaking some of them. After following one bloke into a cafe, he's confronted and finds himself being introduced to Cobb (Alex Haw), a confident thief. The Young Man is interested in people, he likes Cobb's analysis of his prey. Being analytical is a very Nolan trait. The film is built in chapters, Cobb is the first. He's followed by 'The Blonde' (Lucy Russell), who's involved with 'The Bald Guy' (Dick Bradsell) and... well I won't spoil it. These chapters and characters start to splinter as the narrative fractures into an increasing non-linear form, another Nolan hallmark. There's some lovely stuff as the story weaves and bobs intelligently, showing just how manipulative our cast is. There's signposts to the narrative, black eyes, hammers, literal hidden keys, but the fun is seeing how these events unfold on screen in relation to the viewer figuring out the true chronology and what that means. I twig about half way through what it means, or what I think it means and honestly this spoils it a bit for me when I find I'm right. This film works best when you're in the dark, following expectantly. It's not amazing, clearly on a budget with cheap locations, but there's a lot to enjoy and it shows the promise that Nolan went on to deliver. The electro synth score works well, it's sparse and austere. The edit is functional, but effective. Granted some of the acting is a bit flat, but all in all it's a solid start and with a thrifty runtime it's an easy albeit twisty watch."
"Review of Following : We can see influence of Call M for murder.In part of that movie guy follows other , to see his routine and to blackmail him to kill his wife .In this movie writer follows people for inspiration. We can see also influence of diffrent timelines like in Resoirvoir dogs , even we can see RD poster on the wall .Strong debut for litlle money .7 from 10 from me"
"Review of Following : It is Christopher Nolan's first feature film (budget around ¬£3,000 and shot it on weekends), depicting an unemployed young writer who trails strangers through London in order to get inspiration for his first novel, but ends up being drawn into criminal activities and suspicious acquaintances... All main characters (nicely played by still little known British actors) are odd and enigmatic, with inclination to reasoning and justifications. The scenes run smoothly, although it is difficult to follow-up at times and some characters provide no value to the course of events. Mystics is stressed by black-and-white frames and lack of light, but ending scenes give viewers sophisticated explanation how and why all this web was woven... The 80 minutes pass in a catchy manner and if you like Nolan's later mind-twisting works (e.g. Memento and Insomnia), you will like this as well."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan's debut feature film is a tightly crafted thriller that cleverly twists and turns. It's remarkable that Nolan managed to execute the film so seamlessly, considering he made it on a shoestring budget of around six thousand US dollars, filming on weekends with his friends.Despite the absence of a grand scale often associated with Nolan's work, the film still contains his signature elements. The sharp, non-linear editing is paired with an unpredictable and intriguing narrative, while an exciting score enhances the suspense.However, the movie falls short in terms of acting and dialogue. Though the performances are not entirely amateurish, they feel somewhat dry and detract from the overall engagement. Nevertheless, Nolan's directorial prowess shines through, making this debut a promising start to his illustrious career."
"Review of Following : I believe that Nolan is one of the best directors in 21th century but not for this movie, for me the movie must getting the attention of viewers in such a way that make you following the tale of movie and this is Nolan has perfect for it.the other point is that in Nolan's movie you must wait for something that making surprise you and also certainly narrative of story is vague and mystery. I already watching Memento, Inception, Prestige,Dunkirk and Insomnia and I figure out the way of Nolan has not changed.
about the movie I have to say that the story was new for me and like it, even so I told myself""what a cool job! why myself don't it "". I mean that following the different people and also gathering the information of them, it is amazing."
"Review of Following : At 70 minutes long, ""Following"" is Christopher Nolan's shortest feature though it certainly isn't his best. But you've got to hand it to him just for coming up with the fantastic story idea. ""Following"" juggles quite a lot of ideas in its runtime of 70 minutes, but somehow the puzzle still remains incomplete by the end of it.A young writer (Jeremy Theobald) follows people around London to find inspiration for the characters for his first novel. He follows specific people and never the same person again, just to see where they go and what they do but decides never to obsess about or get curious as to why they do what they do. Those are the rules he abides by. One day, he decides to follow a clean cut, smart-looking fellow who goes by the name Cobb (Alex Haw). Cobb quickly figures out that he is being followed and confronts the young writer. Cobb introduces himself as a thief, who burgles the houses of people he finds interesting and asks the young writer to accompany him on his burglaries. The young writer becomes infatuated with a young woman (Lucy Russell) whose house he burgles along with Cobb and then things start to go wrong for him.With a budget so low, a film with a story as gutsy as this deserves high praise. To be honest, ""Following"" starts off spectacularly, skimming the streets of London with inspiring cleverness that makes the city look as tempting as it makes it look dangerous, and Nolan slowly builds the tension the narrative requires. The writing in the first few sequences is outstanding, and Nolan delves into the story as soon as the film begins. The two lead characters, the young man and Cobb, are meticulously written so that the viewer gets a useful insight into their minds, what they are thinking. And that's one very important aspect of the film: You need to guess what the characters are thinking even though they don't voice it out loud. And those are pretty much all the positives I have to say about the film.Somewhere in the midst of the second-half, the film cripples. And that's very unfortunate because Nolan's got some great ideas up his sleeve, and he makes a big flaw of letting one on too soon. After that, the film turns into a drama instead of a mystery for the plot continues to unfold in a frustratingly predictable manner. What's left to enjoy is some kind of twist that unfurls in the last sequence, managing a graceful conclusion to a decent feature. But the plot does not attempt to avert what's about to happen and the conclusion does not differ much from the one you might've guessed sometime during the film.Of the performances, Theobald and Haw are convincing. Haw, who plays the cunning Cobb, certainly looks the part and delivers well. The same goes for Theobald. Russell, on the other hand, lacks the urgency that her character was required to throw up in a traumatic situation. Playing the role of a seductress, she comes off as wooden instead of charming, thus remains totally unconvincing in her performance. ""Following"" has wit and diabolical cleverness stashed up somewhere in its stupendously structured plot. It is a film that won't disappoint you, though when the plot concerns a mystery, I expect it to keep me guessing till the very end. Sadly, ""Following"" fails there."
"Review of Following : The best film done by Christopher Nolan. It is totally overlooked by his latest films but if u watch Following u will be stunned by the details that are very carefully put together. The thing that makes this film so extremely great is the dialogues in which nolan has no equal in my humble opinion. It has very dark and melancholic feeling when u are watching the film. Christopher is known for his unusual ways of filming and if u want to see how it looked before he became the brilliant cinematographer, it is his debut film so good eye will spot the mistakes and despite that u will be hooked from the first second :) ! Very underrated and beautiful film."
"Review of Following : Been a fan of Christopher Nolan's and decided to check out some of his older work. My impression of this film was that it was pretty average and even though it is relatively short, some parts seem to drag on and/or be repetitive. Despite this, the film had an interesting story and was well written, the acting was also quite solid as was the movie as a whole. The ending was also quite good but by now I've come to expect that from Nolan. Several times during the film i caught myself thinking that certain parts were a little cheesy. Not something I would watch again and i do not strongly recommend it but it may be worth your time to see it once."
"Review of Following : A noir-esque tale with abrupt leaps in chronology. In other words, a warm-up for MEMENTO. The later film succeeds both because of and despite its gimmick. The earlier film (Nolan's first feature) ultimately feels nothing but gimmick. The theme of invading other people's lives is shrugged off after a few weak Tyler Durden-isms and never explored in depth. The performances are mediocre. The photography and other technical aspects show promise, but it's not especially impressive craftsmanship. It all just seems to revolve around the cleverness of the script, and I found the gotcha twists a bit tedious. Not bad as a first effort, but not a very fulfilling or even entertaining experience."
"Review of Following : Following, Christopher Nolan's early foray into filmmaking, is a gritty and experimental noir that showcases the director's raw talent and potential. While its strength lies in its minimalist approach and intriguing narrative structure, it can be a divisive viewing experience. The low-budget cinematography adds an authentic and voyeuristic quality, and the performances, particularly by Jeremy Theobald, demonstrate promise. However, its non-linear storytelling, while a hallmark of Nolan's style, might feel confusing or disconnected to some viewers. The lack of a more substantial budget is evident in the production quality, and the absence of a compelling musical score can make it a somewhat forgettable experience. Hence, a 6/10 rating seems apt, as Following marks an interesting starting point in Nolan's career but lacks the polish and depth of his later works."
"Review of Following : The plot was written such that the movie could have several reveals, and some scenes appear out of order chronologically. I guess the viewer is supposed to think ""aha! so that's what was going on!"" several times as the movie progresses, and feel clever and satisfied each time, but I found it to be tedious.Also, just because a plot is difficult to figure out doesn't mean that it's smart or good. If the story were instead told from Cobb's point of view, and in chronological order, it would seem very silly indeed.Otherwise I liked everything about the movie--the setting, the characters, the acting, the dialogue, the individual situations, etc. If the movie had a plot that was interesting and believable and told it without gimmicks, I would definitely rate it 10/10."
"Review of Following : This movie had me at ""may I join you?"". But it lost me 3/4 of the way through. I may not have predicted exactly how it ends. But half way through if I had three guesses one of them would have been right. It starts with a few great character portraits. But it degenerates into a Hitchcock wannabe. I don't object to the portrayal of events, but the buildup to the ""surprise"" ending made the end not worth watching. I think I'll skip Momento. Your comment does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text. Your comment does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text."
"Review of Following : ""Following"" tells of a struggling writer who shadows people as research for his work and in the process falls in with a burglar and finds himself inextricably embroiled in a scheme which could lead to his own end. A Brit flick in black and white, this austere production lacks the usual Hollywoodish tinsel but makes up for the deficit with a solid story line which will keep you guessing to the end....and, unfortunately, beyond.  Good stuff for those into UK indie films where the focus is more on intricately woven story complexities than budget and baubles. (B-)Note - The DVD I watched, which came from Netflix.com, had an annoying icon in the corner, would jump a scene at a time in fast forward and fast reverse, and pixelated periodically. However, it did have extra features including script pages sync'd with the dialogue."
"Review of Following : This is one of those movies it's hard to just pinpoint just a ""good"" and a ""bad"" for. There are some films one simply does not care for. That's not to say the film was bad, it just didn't leave much of an impression.The performances from the three main leads are fine. I found the direction of the film intriguing. At the same time, I can't wasn't on the edge of my seat. And without giving away too much, the twist near the end did catch me by surprise. Yet, I wasn't gravitated by the film to instantly revisit it either like with some twist-endings.I must admit when it comes to Christopher Nolan there has yet to be a film from him I have loved. In my opinion, he is actually gives too much substance without any style and I think this film fits into that category. I am aware I am in the minority on this, so do not take my opinion as full worth.As for me, I found Following to be just okay. I has an interesting story with fine performances and characters, yet fails to leave any emotionally resonant or impactful."
"Review of Following : Following stands as Christopher Nolan's first venture into filmmaking. Although it is sometimes deemed a student film due to its limited budget, this film is way ahead many student films in many aspects. With $6,000 at his disposal and a concise 60-minute runtime, you can observe the early stages of Nolan's distinctive filmmaking style. While the script may lag at times, as well as the acting, it still has the carefully constructed plot with a twist or two often found in many if not all of Nolan's works. For the lovers of Nolan, diving into this film provides a valuable look into his progression and how far he has traveled in his cinematic journey."
"Review of Following : Although I didn't love this film, I can truly appreciate seeing the early signs of Nolan's genius at work here. He had a distinct style from the very beginning and I believe that this movie would've had greater potential with a bigger budget and some more experienced actors. Overall, it had many pieces that were interesting in their own rights, but none of it really meshed that well for me. I can understand why others may love this movie, even though it dragged for me regardless of its short runtime. Nolan's love of great scores and twists are in full effect here as well. And the most exciting part of this film for me was seeing a Batman logo on a door! An incredible foreshadowing of what greatness is to come from Nolan."
"Review of Following : Although Nolan, the filmmaker, was in his infancy when this was being created, I could still notice the sparks of his writing calibre, the mastery underneath that peeked through in some instances.He always had it in him; he knew and understood the craft of storytelling from the very beginning, and this being his debut feature speaks a lot in itself.It may not be anything special, but considering it was his first venture into the terrain of cinema, It's indeed an engaging thriller with all the twists and turns you would typically expect, and the use of monochrome only adds to the overall experience!"
"Review of Following : I was surprised to see this movie was directed by christopher nolan. Being one of his first movies this does really show his creativtiy. And its for the creativity that it gets a six. Sure its a bit of a shame that this movie is as short as it is, but it works and everything is told that needs to be in the short time we get. It sets up this author,played by jeremy theobald and he has no names. He likes following people for his characters and seems a bit of psycho. Until one day he meets a man named cobb that breaks in peoples houses but is not really interested in stealing things. It all leads to jeremy going down this path which he might not get back from. Black and white was an interesting choice but it worked here. Even with a low budget christopher created something that can be looked back on by othetr budding directors and they can understand little things here and there that can make a film great."
"Review of Following : Following is Nolan's first film, and undoubtedly is one of the director's most unknown masterpiece that did great works such as The Prestige, Memento, Inception, Intertellar and the highly acclaimed Batman trilogy, Following is the weakest of the Nolan has a low budget, but the film is not bad, we see some features of Nolan face, the plot tries to be confused at times, the cast is very competent, the photography is good, the script Is good, the pace is competent, even more that the film is very short, the direction of Nolan is good, even more with limitations, Following is an competent film, is the beginning of a director of an enviable curriculum. Note 6.5"
"Review of Following : The jobless protagonist recounts his story to an older man. He has been Shadowing or Following random strangers. One of his biggest rule is never follow the same person twice. He breaks that rule causing him his problem. Cobb confronts him for following him thinking initially he's a cop. Cobb is a burglar and soon, he pulls him into his voyeuristic world. They break into The Blonde's apartment and he becomes fascinated with her. He chats her up at her possessive boyfriend's bar. She tells him that her gangster boyfriend is blackmailing her with incriminating photos and he agrees to break into his safe to retrieve the photos. Unbeknownst to him, Cobb and The Blonde actually know each other.This is Christopher Nolan's low budget black-and-white indie. It has an interesting premise of a guy who follows people around. It intrigued me and so does Cobb. He's a weird magnetic character. Nolan is also playing with flash-forwards which actually distracts from the story. He figures out how to separate the timelines in Memento with color and black-and-white. In this movie, it confuses matters and disrupts the flow. The ending has a few convenient unlikely turns to make Cobb's scheme work. The movie starts off very well but gets a bit problematic."
"Review of Following : An interesting showcase for a lot of the ideas and themes that would permeate a lot of Nolan's later films, but this low budget affair reeks of ""first film,"" right down to the casting of people who don't actually appear to be actors at all and are likely just friends of the director/investors. This does all work to make Theobald's performance stand out, though.The plot is a mite unrealistic and convoluted but keeps you hooked throughout with some great twists and turns.An interesting but imperfect effort. A lot of the ideas on screen would see much better realisation in the later Memento."
"Review of Following : It makes the spectator curious and it kind of stupefies, but it's not more than a puckish and unconventional piece that has a very unlikely plot full of holes."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolans Film debut Following follows the story of a a young man who's a wannabe writer who spends his time following people around. Never approaching he keeps his distance just observe it their everyday life what they do what they eat. Until a man named Cobb notices and the two developed a somewhat friendship as the young man accompanies Cobb break into houses. Soon he starts to get involved in something he wishes he hadn't. While by no means one of his best film's, following shows the sheer effort of how one can still make the best of what their giving.with a mere budget of $6000 the movie makes up for it lack of effect and work with a story with an investing. Albeit a very basic plot that in some way doesn't flesh out enough given the short runtime. But it still grabs you pr interest as some section split up show one thing then it comes back around to how the event came to be. Its shows some early work of what Nolan should later do for memento. Still some of the performances are delivered for the most part good, although there's some hokey acting. With very restrictive access to film added with the cast of people he had to get on standby. Now looking at it now seeing where Nolan has gone, it shows how much you can achieve from so little."
"Review of Following : Done in BW, this modern tale is disconcerting in its erratic time sequences. It appears to start with a young, unemployed writer telling his plight to a counselor. Then maybe he really isn't a writer but just a bum justifying laziness. Then a male subject he is studying turns the tables on him. A female sex object appears from several entry points at once. Crimes start happening, but who is the criminal and who the victim? Is the club owner/gangster the chief villain? Is the finale really the end? If you want to tie it up neater than that you can, but the ends keep coming loose.Fair entertainment for a rainy afternoon."
"Review of Following : This was one of the slowest films I've seen. I get the idea that this was intentional. It was? Oh. O.K. then. I'll take your word for it. Shot in Black and white. Yeh that was clever. Well not really. This was always a black and white flick. Suspense ! What suspense? I must have missed that, Was it when he was messing about with the time shift? The ending? Great. But does the ending justify the means. Almost. But not quite. Great for a first movie. This guy will get better. He does? Oh yeah. Memento. Really weird, but better. Insomnia? Yeah, now he's cooking. I await his next film. Batman Begins, is it? Wow, there'll be no "" Holy haberdashery, Batman! ""in that one."
"Review of Following : This is a very well put together film.  The chronology is played around with, leaving you aware of future situations but unsure of the events which lead to them.  In Following, as with Memento, illusions are suggested which lure you away from guessing what could happen next.  This is done quite well, and often creates a nervous atmosphere, much like you might expect a cat-burglar (as is in the story) to experience.  Clever twists, a sharp plot, cannily shot in black and white, which was a very good choice, this has a lot going for it; especially for a cheap first picture for Christopher Nolan.  However, in spells it's a little dull.  The momentum sags and once it's clear what's going on, the eventual ending is logical but perfunctory.Worth a watch, but could've been cut down to about an hour dead or less and been much better.  6/10"
"Review of Following : Somewhere I saw this movie described as a ""no-budget film noir"".  Making a film on a small budget and having it come out a success is not without precedent.  However, the roughness around the edges of this movie got in the way of me really enjoying it.  One example is the ending credits screen, which could have been of higher quality.  Black-and-white photography works well here as a story-telling tool, but shaking and jittery movements that are apparently a result of hand-held camera-work distracts the viewer's attention (unlike the Blair Witch Project, where jittery camera movements are to be expected).This film would be great as something used in a film class to show individuality in style; however, as a commercial venture it fails to hold a candle to Memento (where Nolan really got things right) or Blood Simple.My review: 6 out of 10"
"Review of Following : Not for me at allI rate it so low because this type of movie is absolutely not geared toward me, I found it boring and I simply wasn't interested, within that, there are some positives that I want to highlight.There are some really good scenes of Dialogue, the apparent 6k budget is beyond impressive to make a movie of this quality. The story is good but not enough for me, seems a bit all over the place it's about a young writer who follows people for inspiration that is found by a thief who takes him under his wing.Yea not for me unfortunately and it's bottom of the Nolan barrel, a good directorial debut to say the least just not my cup of tea, 5/10."
"Review of Following : One can see the idea developing, but it isn't fully fleshed out in this film.  The play with time, the memory and identity confusions, the manipulations -- they are all very interesting in their own rights, but don't meld into a watchable movie in this case.  The story drags, and in scene after scene I found myself thinking, ""I get the point, so what happens next?"" See Memento, rather."
Review of Following : Nolan wanted to deliver a message through this work and she is not an idiot.
"Review of Following : Following has some interesting ideas, and it certainly isn't a bad film, but it is my least favorite Christopher Nolan film to date. Nolan is a great director who would go on to direct some great movies (Memento, Inception, The Dark Knight), but his first movie just didn't do much for me personally.I actually just finished watching this movie for a second time earlier today, and I've already forgotten it. That's the big problem with this movie, it's very boring at times and almost completely forgettable. It has the same non-coherent style of storytelling that Nolan would use on Momento, but for me it just felt unneeded.To be fair, the acting is good, it has some neat ideas, and I really loved the twist ending, but for the most part I just sat there uninterested.Following isn't a bad movie, it's just forgettable. It's my least favorite Nolan movie to date, and while I applaud him for making this movie on a shoestring budget, the final product left me disappointed.5.5/10"
"Review of Following : A young writer who follows strangers for material meets a thief who takes him under his wing.After seeing Nolan's work with Memento, I became highly interesting in this highly interesting movie. The movie is shot in black and white, much like a noir style. The movie's structure seems to be very similar to Memento's which leads me to think that this was somewhat of a blueprint of Memento. I do find this movie interesting, while shot in a low budget, it seemed like Nolan could've done better. The story is interesting but suddenly falls. Why? I don't know, this movie is really not my cup of tea and it doesn't strike my interest as it had some. So really, big Nolan fans alike, will love it or hate it. I personally disliked it but that's just my opinion. I rated it 5 for his work to impress others. And I knocked down 5 since it did not keep my interest for very long. 5/10."
"Review of Following : Why is this story told backwards and what's the chronological version like? Is there a way to find it online? Also, is the burglar's name really Cobb or the name on the credit card that the young man forged? The old man at the end states there's no listing of Cobb and that the house being robbed was Danny's (the name on the credit card). Yet, in the beginning, we see the two rob Cobb's house without the young man knowing that it's his. It would make sense since Cobb never had a last name and police don't know what he looks like anyway."
"Review of Following : People seem to love this film. Reviews talk about its ingenious twists and turns. Well, maybe if I'd never seen ""House Of Games"" or even ""The Usual Suspects"" I might have been a bit more surprised. But as it was, I figured out who was pulling the wool over whose eyes pretty much from the word go. Perhaps I've just watched too many double-(or triple-)cross thrillers.This is basically apprentice work. Nolan wrote a film he could shoot for peanuts. In that respect, there's no denying he's done a great job. Despite the fact you can hear the camera running in most shots, he's put together a well directed film that manages to rise above its zero budget. But the script needs so much more work - it really could've done with a couple of more drafts. It falls into some very basic traps, like characters constantly ""explaining"" the plot to other characters for the benefit of the audience. The acting is okay, though funnily enough the best performance comes from someone who never had any intention of becoming a professional actor (he's now an architect).I thought all the twists and turns a bit tiresome. Very much hand-me-down Mamet. The actual idea of ""following"" complete strangers is quite intriguing. Too bad the movie doesn't bother to pursue it after the first few minutes.Still, Nolan designed this as a calling card movie. Like an eye-catching student movie, it got him noticed, and he's now working in Hollywood. And I wish him well. In fact, his Director's Commentary on the DVD of ""Following"" is much more interesting than the film itself.Watch it if you're a bit curious. But, really, it's no great shakes."
"Review of Following : I`m in two minds about FOLLOWING , the film debut of Christopher Nolan . Part of me admires it for costing 6,000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house . In many ways it reminds me of the cult movie PI , a film I disliked , and I can`t get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around . Wouldn`t it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? Oh well I guess FOLLOWING gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing $6,000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it , but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn`t made by the director of MEMENTO ?"
"Review of Following : I was already aware that this was Nolan's 'least-best' film, but not that it would be so screwy. I compare this to Kubrick's first film, Fear and Desire (1953), as both are so amateurish and terrible works that it looks like prototype feature films for what Kubrick and Nolan would be after. Of course, Following is much better than Fear and Desire, but it's still a little scary.The story of the feature is a bag, difficult to follow, with superficial and uninteresting characters. La Haine (1995) without the ending is the same as Following. Why black and white photography? The direction is poorly done, the shots are pretty ugly, the acting is really bad and the twist is stupid. The film also abuses too much of the unnecessary scenes too much, the film could quietly last less, the storytelling here is absolutely horrible crap, not even to entertain this film works."
"Review of Following : Inception, The Dark Knight, The Prestige, Batman Begins, Insomnia, Memento, these are the list of Christopher Nolan directing movies, and ""following"" is the debut and logical as a debut, but absolutely not even close to the other of his great career! This film presents some really interesting ideas and interesting story, but I didn't find it to be particularly well-ended. It was black and white, it was short and low budget, but from the middle of this movie I felt it is going to shakeup! and it did. The acting doesn't match the audacity of the script. The script doesn't stand up in a court of logic. The promise fails to fulfill the idea."
"Review of Following : I don't care if your plot is original, without plotholes, and explains everything, as long as it is boring.Following is the most boring film by Nolan. I was in a mood to give it a 1 but then I thought I must reserve it only exceptionally poor films, Following is not among those.Characters are not given any details. They are dull and one-dimensional. In Memento, the plot covered for it and the characters had their motivations for what they were doing. But here, there is no one to support the plot.Performances are no good. Remember Dial M for murder, a brilliant smart film on a simple idea. But here, Nolan, in an attempt to make it complex and to look smart, has made a story without anything interesting.It's in black and white. Now, I have seen Black and White films from the silent era, but they were, by no means, as boring as this one."
"Review of Following : Instead of risking my neck to catch coronavirus along with Nolan's latest film, why not see his widely praised debut at home? So here a few things i have to note.1) It's pretentious. Both the hero and the hitman have some interesting philosophies motivating their actions but the film soon dumps these ideas revealing its conventional and hollow plot.2) It's unnecessarily convoluted, the 31 (according to trivia) changes of timeline could just as well have been served by a couple of flashbacks at the final act to deliver the twists and fill the plot holes.3) It isn't suspenseful. The first timeline is about the hero turning into a fanboy almost at first sight and then the low-stake scenes repeat themselves. The second is the hero getting a girlfriend which also is suspense-free until very late in the film when she reveals what she really wants of him to do while the last timeline is him preparing for the safe heist. That would have been thrilling if the non-linear mess had presented the stakes behind the heist, only it doesn't but after it happens so we get a random heist.4) It doesn't make much sense. Is the hitman planning to frame the hero for a burglary gone wrong or for a date ending in homicide? If it's the burglary, why instruct the woman to date him? Planting the evidence at the crime scene is more than enough. If it's the date option, the police always has the date/husband on top of their suspect list. The things stolen from her house are not needed to be found at the hero's place for the authorities to be convinced about the hero-victim connection.5) The hitman's plan is one of the dumbest in movie history. He is the first paid killer to date his victim by plan, leaving witnesses and DNA everywhere to connect him with her if anything goes wrong. He also befriends the guy to be framed so another set of witnesses like the couple that saw them robbing their apartment, can testify of them being accomplices in crime6) I wonder, if the hero didn't do the incredibly stupid thing of surrendering to the police would they have found him? He's a very meek guy with almost certainly no criminal record, so nothing for the cops to compare the evidence at the crime scene with. That means the hitman's plan hinges on the hero being as dumb as humanly possible, surrendering willfully to the police and confessing. Not a great plan.7) Let's suppose that the hero after declaring his intentions to the woman about confessing and surrendering to the cops, does the obvious, sensible thing, gets a cab and heads to the police station. That sounds like a bulletproof alibi as the time of death would prove. Again, not a great plan by the hitman8) Why the hitman beat up the hero? No, Nolan wanting the bruises on the hero to differentiate the second from the third timeline doesn't qualify as an answer.9) The way the victim was murdered is identical to how the mobster that hired the hitman, is killing his victims. That would lead the police straight to him as this is his signature killing since he could have just as well have hired the fall guy. Again, it doesn't sound like an intelligent plan.So overall an unnecessarily convoluted, poorly constructed, pretentious and dumb film that if it wasn't for Nolan people would have easily pointed at its shortcomings."
"Review of Following : The debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured, if limited, stab at the con game and obsession.  Filmed for zero money, Nolan couldn't have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of London to ply his trade, given the lack of funds.  This short (67 min) is at its best in playing with the audience's and protagonist's expectations about who is scamming whom, though the initial set-up does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept. The muddy cinematography (he often used natural lighting due to budget) can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization, though the limitations do show at times.One can easily see Nolan's style developing in this fledgling effort; many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in MEMENTO and INSOMNIA.  Not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and Nolan fans."
"Review of Following : After watching Memento one might well wonder how Christopher Nolan pulled off something that audacious, that brilliant, in what was his major directorial debut. Watch Following, the no-budget thriller which was Nolan's actual directorial debut, and you begin to understand. With no money, with an amateur cast and doing pretty much everything (writing, shooting, directing) himself Nolan created a little masterpiece. Whatever ""it"" is that enables someone to make great movies Nolan clearly has it. And had it right from the beginning.Fans of Memento will see a lot of similarities, hints of what was to come, in Following. The most obvious parallel is the nonlinear time structure as the story here unfolds completely out of order. Whereas the story in Memento proceeded more or less in a straight line which just happened to be moving backwards here there is no line at all. Scenes are placed in a seemingly random order. We're all over the place. At the end, in the beginning, somewhere in the middle, back to the end again...it really could have been a jumbled mess. But Nolan gives us a little assistance in orienting ourselves with the shifting appearance of his main character. He has three distinct looks to him and once you figure that out you can figure out where you are in the story. But there are still enough twists and turns to make your head spin, to keep you guessing right up to the end.The less said about the plot the better. Best to let you try to piece the puzzle together for yourself. Much like Memento you really have to see it all the way through to fully appreciate the true genius of it, to understand how any missteps from Nolan along the way could have unraveled his whole story. When the movie concludes you can't help but be amazed that Nolan could pull this off essentially by himself. At least with Memento he had a little help. Here it's just Nolan and his small cast. There are really only three roles of any significance in the film, maybe four if you're being generous. But this little troupe and their first-time director combined to create something really special. The acting may at times seem a bit amateurish but that has to be expected from performers who are certainly not acting pros. And any little quibbles with the performances do not detract at all from the overall movie-watching experience. The actors do more than well enough to get by, well enough in fact that you're surprised there were not bigger acting roles for them somewhere down the line if they wanted them. That the performers have a great story to work with certainly helped their cause.Things do get a little convoluted in the end as Nolan's story takes its final turns. You worry that things may be getting away from him a little bit. But he manages to ultimately pull it all together. You may have to really think about it after things are through but it all makes sense when you run it back in your mind. And it's nice every now and again to have a movie that actually requires you to think isn't it? Christopher Nolan seems to specialize in movies like that. He just makes great movies. Here he did it with no money, all on his own, never having made a movie before. It takes a special talent to pull that off. And among his many talents Nolan also apparently possesses the ability to see into his own future. When you watch Following note the Batman logo on the main character's apartment door."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan's first directorial effort, a year before he did ""Memento,"" and this is almost as brilliant as that classic.  He uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell his story, and it's a very clever one.Bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about.  One day, he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what he's up to.  Cobb is a burglar and he takes Bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes.  Both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them. But there's an ulterior motive for Cobb nurturing this relationship, and it all ties in very smartly at the end.  No, I won't spoil it but this is a very cool movie and I'm beginning to think Christopher Nolan is a genius.If you like suspense films with surprise endings, this one is a must see."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out. Shot on a micro budget of $6,000 this is a student film with real class. The film is shot in black and white, and features people who you assume are friends of Nolan's appearing in the movie. This is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago.Nolan's thriller, much like Memento, does not play chronologically, it shifts the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction. The writing is fantastic. It is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting. I thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent.
For a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all, this is so good. It is superior to most that Hollywood studios offer and Nolan after three films (this, the superior Memento and the not quite as good but still excellent Insomnia) has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times. I can't wait for Batman.This film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch. It is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising. I also thought that the score from David Julyan was also excellent, very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it. He has gone on to compose Nolan's other films. Overall I would recommend this, I intend to get all of Nolan's films. This is a low budget gem. *****"
"Review of Following : Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal' way, once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this doozy of a film noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story intertwine), and once with the director's commentary running. Quite amazing. A bare-bones tale, told with more flair, energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today. I think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent Memento, which turned me on to Nolan in the first place. Can't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget (and bigger box-office stars) in his next film, Insomnia."
"Review of Following : Vital and inventive British film about a man who becomes obsessed with randomly picking people out in the street and following themBill becomes obsessed with picking people out in the street at random and following them. He is drawn into the criminal underworld when he chooses to follow a burglar, Cobb, who catches him in the act and encourages him to take things further... This is a rare and inventive British film, one not concerned with being flavour of the month in the style mags. Its low budget is displayed like a badge of pride, which is refreshing rather than annoying. It runs out of steam before the end, but Nolan hints at something very special here."
"Review of Following : Not one of Nolan's best films (second weakest from personal opinion), but for a debut and for being made on such a low budget much of 'Following' is very impressive. Even if it became much more refined in his later films, there is a sense that Nolan has found his style and not hopelessly trying to find his feet.'Following' isn't perfect. The motivation for the lead female character is very thin, likewise with the character herself and Lucy Russell is a blank acting-wise. The film doesn't get going straight away with a slightly dull first 10 minutes, and there is one or two twist(s) too many which gives the ending a convoluted and contrived feel.However, the production values could have been much worse considering that it was a debut film and that the budget was reminiscent of a miniscule student film budget. Granted, Nolan's visual style became more audacious in later films, and very quickly (the difference in style between 'Following' and his next, and best, film 'Memento' is staggering), but as the way it's shot, lit and composed has much more atmosphere and class than most ""student films"" calling it one seems somewhat of an insult.David Julyan provides a chilling score, that is not as good as his thematically complex one for 'Memento' but on the same level as that for 'Insomnia' and better than the fitting (within the film) forgettable (on its own) one for 'The Prestige'.Apart from the odd stilted moment, the dialogue has many clever and thoughtful ones, and Nolan does a good job directing even if more expansive, ambitious and refined in his later films. The story is interesting and remarkably tight, with very few needless elements, a case of ambition mostly not getting in the way (something that undermined 'Interstellar' and to a lesser extent 'Inception', though those films have many strong elements) until the ending tries to do a little too much.Characters are interesting, being likable but doing not so likable things. The acting is mostly very much committed, with Alex Haw especially being very good and charismatic.On the whole, Nolan went on to do much better things (especially with 'The Dark Knight' trilogy and 'Memento') but 'Following' is not a bad start at all and fares better than some more famous and more influential director's debut films (Kubrick with 'Fear and Desire' for example). 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"Review of Following : I just finished watching Following and I thought it was great. I rated it 8 out of 10. I plan on watching it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order.I rented this movie because of my fascination of Christopher Nolan's more recent movie Memento. Following has some similarities; this movie was probably the blueprint for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar.Shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. The story and dialogue is really good. The performance of the actors is believable.Christopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget. I look forward to his next release Insomnia, a big budget movie with my favourite actor Al Pacino."
"Review of Following : Saucy, eh ? If at all you're familiar with Christopher Nolan's style of film-making, watching this will at once make you realize where it all started. Its also of course possible that it began much before this but since much of that material isn't accessible to the public (save Doodlebug), we'll never really know. For all purposes, Following remains Nolan's feature film debut and it surely is a remarkable achievement.The story follows Bill, a struggling unemployed writer who takes a liking to following people in hopes of finding material to write about. This liking soon turns into addiction forcing Bill to set rules to allow him to restrain his activities. One of the rules which he ends up breaking, is following the same person twice. The person with whom this rule is broken is Cobb, who soon confronts Bill about being followed. As it turns out, Cobb is a burglar who enjoys robbing people, not for the money, but rather for the sheer pleasure in taking away things that people took for granted; his belief being that it would make them realize what they had. Taken away by Cobb's lifestyle, Bill becomes a partner in his burglaries which is where the trouble begins.Digging any more into the plot would serve to spoil the complex mystery that Following is. Following has a lot of those narrative structures that would become trademarks of Nolan's directorial style (intercuts, close-up inserts, non-linear editing, multiple chronologies, and so on). Nolan and crew were forced to make certain hard choices to obscure the severely limited budget, one of which was shooting the film in black and white. Of course, the plot was such that these decisions worked the film's favor. The film's incredible naturalism repeatedly comes to mind while watching the film. This is due largely in part to the film being shot hand-held, with scenes filmed in a take or two to save on film stock. The behind the scenes material with the film reveals this and other fascinating details about the film's production such as the crew shooting over weekends due to their jobs on weekdays as a result of which the film took a year to complete.Despite the low budget, you're always hooked on to Following and that is due largely in part to the film's plot and tight writing (another of Nolan's strengths). Unlike many filmmakers who use lavish editing styles and gimmicky display effects, Nolan's films rely primarily on story and screenplay to get the viewers attention (with the occasional non-linear editing thrown in to really keep the audience alert at all times). Add to it, the intriguing characters which have personalities so distinct it appears Nolan himself followed a handful of people to get the traits right. Jeremy Theobald is as natural as the gullible Bill as Alex Haw is suave in the role of Cobb. And the chemistry between the two is so natural, it makes most of the dialogues they say seem improvised, as though real people were conversing.Following is a great start for Nolan who has now moved on to bigger, elaborate and definitely better projects. It is a lesson for aspiring filmmakers that even with a limited budget, it is possible to make a feature as interesting, riveting and thrilling as some of the best noirs of the early 40s. While it may not be perfect, most of the limitations it suffers from are largely due to production values rather than plotting and pacing. It is nevertheless, a must watch for anyone who has even the slightest of respect for Christopher Nolan's film-making.Overall Score: 7.0 / 10"
"Review of Following : Great film. No gratuitous gimmicks like in most Hollywood films. Everything supported the suspense of the plot. B&w gave it a basic, no-frills feel also. In short, it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and cast.Following serves as an interesting contrast to Memento. Characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively. In that sense, both reminded me somewhat of ""In the Company of Men,"" also highly recommendable. One difference between Nolan's two films is that Memento was a little easier for me to follow, given that the b&w scenes progress in a constant chronological direction, and so do those in color. I don't think that was true of Following, where scenes seemed to be shown at random. If you have the choice between VCR and DVD, I'd highly recommend DVD, since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in chronological order, not just in the scrambled (albeit ingenuous) order presented by Nolan. It also makes it easier, upon a second viewing, to piece the order together for yourself, if you want to.As another viewer noted, one of the best things about both this movie and Memento is that none of the cast were famous. They were characters, not big-name actors who brought in personas developed in other movies.Given certain similarities in the plots, I wonder if Memento is sort of a remake of Following, but intended to reach a bigger audience, like Edward Burns made She's the One in the mold of -- and with largely the same cast as -- The Brothers McMullan."
"Review of Following : Following 9-29-08Every narrative film needs that hook...that undefinable something that will keep your butt in the seat till the credits roll. Its the one thing any remotely ""good"" film has to do. Following's non-linear structure interestingly enough had me hooked nearly immediately. The film begins with a clean cut looking fella dressed nicely then flashes back and we see the same character now looking rather bohemian....another jump involves our hero lying on the ground having been beaten with a rubber glove shoved in his mouth. These sorts of jumps in the narrative arc of the character occur frequently throughout the film. Begging one to ask how did these future events occur and why? Following's structural approach gives us a narrative that is much greater than the sum of its parts."
"Review of Following : In this intriguing noir thriller (looking like the Forties, but with a  psychology befitting the Nineties), Director Christopher Nolan employs  a number of techniques he would perfect in his internationally  acclaimed Memento (2000), most notably scenes presented out of time  sequence for effect, and a naive protagonist taken advantage of by  others.  The film opens with ""Bill, the Innocent"" (as I might dub him), played  by Jeremy Theobald, trying to explain to someone, perhaps a social  worker, perhaps even a police inspector (John Nolan), why he took up  following people just for the fun of it. He doesn't just follow women,  he points out.  He's not a stalker, as such. He's just curious. He's an intriguing and  sympathetic character, a Brit writer with a lot of time on his hands  who seems something of a throwback to an earlier age with his clanking  manual typewriter and the photo of a pursed-lips Marilyn Monroe on the  wall of his shabby apartment.  Things began to go wrong for him, he further explains, when he broke  some of his ""following rules"" and got too close to his prey. What he  doesn't know and what we don't know yet, is that his clumsy following  technique has allowed him to unwittingly become the followed himself.  Enter a juicy blonde (Lucy Russell) walking down some steps from her  apartment. (This scene is out of sequence as far as chronological time  goes, but psychologically speaking, her appearance signals his  entanglement). Enter now a scheming, sophisticated psychopathic  thrill-seeker named Cobb (Alex Haw) who entices Bill with his  (apparent) practice of burglary just for the powerful feeling one gets  from invading the sanctity of another's life.  Although justification for the temporal inversions here is not as  clearly established as in Memento, nonetheless the technique works  well, and Nolan provides us with a clever ending that sneaks up on us  and makes in a few seconds all that went before clear. Or mostly clear.  You might want to rewind and view the first few minutes of the film,  and then everything should be clarity.  This low-budget, black and white, deliciously ironic little film (71  minutes) marked the auspicious debut of a film maker who has already  made quite a name for himself, not only with the aforementioned  Memento, but with Insomnia (2002). It will be interesting to see what  Nolan does next."
"Review of Following : At 70 minutes long, ""Following"" is Christopher Nolan's shortest feature though it certainly isn't his best. But you've got to hand it to him just for coming up with the fantastic story idea. ""Following"" juggles quite a lot of ideas in its runtime of 70 minutes, but somehow the puzzle still remains incomplete by the end of it.A young writer (Jeremy Theobald) follows people around London to find inspiration for the characters for his first novel. He follows specific people and never the same person again, just to see where they go and what they do but decides never to obsess about or get curious as to why they do what they do. Those are the rules he abides by. One day, he decides to follow a clean cut, smart-looking fellow who goes by the name Cobb (Alex Haw). Cobb quickly figures out that he is being followed and confronts the young writer. Cobb introduces himself as a thief, who burgles the houses of people he finds interesting and asks the young writer to accompany him on his burglaries. The young writer becomes infatuated with a young woman (Lucy Russell) whose house he burgles along with Cobb and then things start to go wrong for him.With a budget so low, a film with a story as gutsy as this deserves high praise. To be honest, ""Following"" starts off spectacularly, skimming the streets of London with inspiring cleverness that makes the city look as tempting as it makes it look dangerous, and Nolan slowly builds the tension the narrative requires. The writing in the first few sequences is outstanding, and Nolan delves into the story as soon as the film begins. The two lead characters, the young man and Cobb, are meticulously written so that the viewer gets a useful insight into their minds, what they are thinking. And that's one very important aspect of the film: You need to guess what the characters are thinking even though they don't voice it out loud. And those are pretty much all the positives I have to say about the film.Somewhere in the midst of the second-half, the film cripples. And that's very unfortunate because Nolan's got some great ideas up his sleeve, and he makes a big flaw of letting one on too soon. After that, the film turns into a drama instead of a mystery for the plot continues to unfold in a frustratingly predictable manner. What's left to enjoy is some kind of twist that unfurls in the last sequence, managing a graceful conclusion to a decent feature. But the plot does not attempt to avert what's about to happen and the conclusion does not differ much from the one you might've guessed sometime during the film.Of the performances, Theobald and Haw are convincing. Haw, who plays the cunning Cobb, certainly looks the part and delivers well. The same goes for Theobald. Russell, on the other hand, lacks the urgency that her character was required to throw up in a traumatic situation. Playing the role of a seductress, she comes off as wooden instead of charming, thus remains totally unconvincing in her performance. ""Following"" has wit and diabolical cleverness stashed up somewhere in its stupendously structured plot. It is a film that won't disappoint you, though when the plot concerns a mystery, I expect it to keep me guessing till the very end. Sadly, ""Following"" fails there."
"Review of Following : People seem to love this film. Reviews talk about its ingenious twists and turns. Well, maybe if I'd never seen ""House Of Games"" or even ""The Usual Suspects"" I might have been a bit more surprised. But as it was, I figured out who was pulling the wool over whose eyes pretty much from the word go. Perhaps I've just watched too many double-(or triple-)cross thrillers.This is basically apprentice work. Nolan wrote a film he could shoot for peanuts. In that respect, there's no denying he's done a great job. Despite the fact you can hear the camera running in most shots, he's put together a well directed film that manages to rise above its zero budget. But the script needs so much more work - it really could've done with a couple of more drafts. It falls into some very basic traps, like characters constantly ""explaining"" the plot to other characters for the benefit of the audience. The acting is okay, though funnily enough the best performance comes from someone who never had any intention of becoming a professional actor (he's now an architect).I thought all the twists and turns a bit tiresome. Very much hand-me-down Mamet. The actual idea of ""following"" complete strangers is quite intriguing. Too bad the movie doesn't bother to pursue it after the first few minutes.Still, Nolan designed this as a calling card movie. Like an eye-catching student movie, it got him noticed, and he's now working in Hollywood. And I wish him well. In fact, his Director's Commentary on the DVD of ""Following"" is much more interesting than the film itself.Watch it if you're a bit curious. But, really, it's no great shakes."
"Review of Following : Bill, Jeremy Theobald, is an inspiring writer who hasn't gotten anything published as of yet. Bill also has an odd and strange habit, he likes to follow people.Bill picks out some stranger in the streets diner or on the subway, metro, and follows them as if he were their shadow. Maybe Bill does this to help him in inspiring himself to write the great novel that he's been dreaming about or get an article of his get printed in a major magazine? Maybe it's because it fills Bill's lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by his paying attention to him or her? Or maybe it gives Bill someone to look after and care about and be responsible for besides himself? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone : after you follow him or her to their home or place of work you stop. One day Bill follows Cobb, Alex Haw, home and instead of following his rule of stopping he still keeps following Cobb. Bill will soon realize how right he was with that rule he set for himself in following people and at the same time how wrong he was by breaking it. Amazingly good low-budget movie made by Christopher Noland in 1998 before he hit it big in Hollywood with his ground-breaking and original motion picture classic ""Momento"" some two years later that has already become a major cult movie. ""Following"" is actually a much better movie then ""Momento"" because it's a conventional and easy to follow story. Compared to ""Momento's"" which was at first confusing and then when you realize what the movie is telling you in it's backward storyline very complicated. Whats makes ""Following"" so much better is just by it being simple but at the same time brainy in it's affect on those who watch it. The movie is far more direct as well as devastating and you don't have to see it over and over to get just what it was trying to tell them like ""Momento"" did. ""Following"" is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising as well as simply manipulated ending, if you watch the movie again and notice the clues, that you'll ever see.Made with an unbelievably small budget of $6,000.00, thats less then what most Hollywood movies budgets out for coffee-breaks, with a no-name cast in black and white and just over one hour, 71 minutes, long. Hollywood as well as the motion picture industry outside of Hollywood can learn a lot from Chris Noland in how someone with nothing more then talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can't; make an intelligent and at the same time penetrating film with next to nothing in money and no big name stars."
"Review of Following : I saw this movie after I saw Memento.  I was very impressed with Memento so when I saw this at the local video store, I decided to check it out.  I was equally impressed with this little film.  I like black and white films so that was bonus, especially for a noir film.  I thought the acting was very good by actors I have never noticed in other films.  It is short and makes you think, which you can't state about many films.  I loved to guess where a film is going and 90% of the time I know the general outline of the film and where it is going in the first 10 minutes.  Nolan's films are never that easy to decipher at first glance.  I won't spoil the film other than to state the protagonist of the film is not talking to his shrink after he has taken his stalking too far at the beginning of the film as I originally surmised.  This movie is basically a rough draft for some of the ideas and themes Nolan would later explore and exploit in Memento. It works on its own and if Nolan had never done anything afterwards would still be a major talent."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan is a sick man.  I say this with all due respect, after witnessing his almost-legendary first feature, ""Following"".  This is not a normal film.  Even if its narrative were presented in strict chronological order it would still not be normal.  Its stark monochrome cinematography, weird music, bizarre performances (which range from the subtle to the wooden, often in the same sentence) and disturbingly warped plot all serve to instill a deep sense of unease in the hapless viewer.  Why do we watch films like this?  Certainly, part of the pleasure comes from seeing characters with whom we can identify and empathise, carrying out acts most of us will never do: burgling, beating, safe-cracking, you know the sort of thing.  Oh, and breaking people's fingers with hammers.  This is not a ""nice"" film.  I would recommend it to anyone, with the warning that they may not enjoy it, but they should definitely see it.  It's seedier than ""Memento"" (Nolan's recent cult classic) and cuts up the narrative for no real reason other than because it can.  This has the mind-bending effect of, for example, showing someone's beaten-up face long before we find out who provided the beating.  Why does Nolan do this?  Because he can.  Because it's cool.  Because it all adds to the menace and unease and perverse pleasure of this strange, strange movie. The follower becomes the followed.  Victim becomes assailant.  Telling the truth lands you in prison.  Lover becomes victim.  Movie audience becomes deeply impressed. Christopher Nolan, you are a sick man, and I applaud you and wait with baited breath for your next excursion into mind-f*ck cinema."
"Review of Following : The best film done by Christopher Nolan. It is totally overlooked by his latest films but if u watch Following u will be stunned by the details that are very carefully put together. The thing that makes this film so extremely great is the dialogues in which nolan has no equal in my humble opinion. It has very dark and melancholic feeling when u are watching the film. Christopher is known for his unusual ways of filming and if u want to see how it looked before he became the brilliant cinematographer, it is his debut film so good eye will spot the mistakes and despite that u will be hooked from the first second :) ! Very underrated and beautiful film."
"Review of Following : Christopher Nolan had his goals set on Following in a very narrow direction, and in that direction he pulled off something that reminded me of the kind of great little 'poverty-row' movies the likes of Ullmer directed back in the 40s. Only this time, he's able to implement touches of homage- things like black and white photography (a given due to the shoe-string budget but also essential to the dark crevices these characters inhabit) and casting of the actors (the John Doe lead, the slick male counterpart, and the beautiful-in-a-gritty way femme fatale)- while keeping it in the realm of the 90s underground indie where for several thousand dollars and specific choices in locations and music and such anything could be possible. That, and as well in the film-noir mood Nolan also puts together a cunning web of a plot, maybe even more so than Memento. Where the latter was a work of a psychology unfolding by way of a plot enriched by looking to the past inch by inch, here the non-linear structure serves the purpose of showing how far someone like Bill can go through as dark a path as Cobb, only in an environment where keeping on your toes is not for someone who's not really twisted and into the deeper mind games Cobb is.Of course, the whole act of following someone becomes the main thrust of the story, and going into it I wasn't even sure where it would lead, if it might be some kind of stream of consciousness ala Slacker where Nolan would lead his character along to one urban British person to another. But the establishment of the ties of Bill to Cobb are done in a quick and excellent way, as we see right when Cobb approaches Bill at the caf√© to ask what he's doing following him tells almost all we need to know about both- that, and the first robbery he brings him along for. What seems to soon be a good score on the horizon is really all one big set-up by Cobb and his lady (just called 'The Blonde', maybe a too-obvious homage to noir, but why carp). But this is revealed in a way that actually truly had me guessing, as the manipulation of the narrative worked all the more to arouse questions not so much of why but of how. The density is brought out all the greater due to the actors understanding of their essential points as characters, with Alex Haw being brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely mask his 'deep' ideas about what it is to really take pleasure in a burglary, and Theobald with that demeanor of someone who can never be as smart as he is in what he really does, but is more intelligent in that naive way that stands no chance in the dank environment such as this; Russell almost makes it too easy, even with a face that would send Ana Savage shaking her head.Meanwhile, Nolan is also on the ball with his style as a cameraman, keeping nothing in that doesn't add to ambiance and suspense, with the fade-in/fade-outs not too quick to leave a lasting impression, but enough to add to the 'this-could-lead-anywhere' logic of the script. He follows it in hand-held form as if he knows where his limitations lie, and yet is fantastic at keeping the essentials: close-ups when need be (one I loved is Russell's face in a small mirror), and a fairly simple techno track that never detracts. Sometimes, as mentioned, the line between seeing something in 'present-day' and seeing something that is as everlasting as a solid pulp story of low-level criminals with mind-games and moral ambiguity is always never totally clear, which for me is practically irresistible in its dark way. Simply put, this is one of the great calling cards I've seen from a filmmaker in recent years, and should hopefully be something that future fans of Nolan's other work can look forward to to discovering. Or even to those who think that noir has gone to the rapid-editing and big-gun-firing dogs of the mainstream (even in independent films) it's a bright little 71 minutes."
"Review of Following : Been a fan of Christopher Nolan's and decided to check out some of his older work. My impression of this film was that it was pretty average and even though it is relatively short, some parts seem to drag on and/or be repetitive. Despite this, the film had an interesting story and was well written, the acting was also quite solid as was the movie as a whole. The ending was also quite good but by now I've come to expect that from Nolan. Several times during the film i caught myself thinking that certain parts were a little cheesy. Not something I would watch again and i do not strongly recommend it but it may be worth your time to see it once."
"Review of Following : FILM: 9/10.Christopher Nolan's feature-length directorial debut, Following, is an absolute masterclass in filmmaking. Right from the start, the non-linear storytelling and the way the narrative unfolds is captivating. Nolan's ability to keep viewers engaged and guessing is impressive.The film has all the hallmarks of Nolan's signature style that we've come to love in his later works. The writing is incredibly smart, with each scene serving a purpose and contributing to the overall story. It's always a joy to connect the dots and piece together the puzzles Nolan weaves in his works.The concept behind Following is intriguing and thought-provoking. It delves into the themes of identity, obsession, and the blurred lines between reality and fiction. The characters are complex and layered, and their interactions are both tense and riveting. Their journeys and choices unfold to the tune of David Julyan's sparse, but effective score.Nolan's direction is tight and focused, showcasing his talent even in his early days as a filmmaker. The black and white cinematography adds a noir-like atmosphere, further enhancing the film's mysterious and suspenseful tone. The attention to detail is remarkable, and every shot feels purposeful. It remains an impressive effort even when stscked up his more recent works.While Following might not have the scale or grandeur of Nolan's later blockbusters, it doesn't diminish its impact. In fact, it's precisely the film's modesty that allows it to shine. The minimalistic approach, combined with Nolan's keen storytelling instincts, creates a truly compelling cinematic experience.It might sound like hyperbole, but Following is a brilliant debut and dangerously close to being a masterpiece. It showcases Nolan's talent and sets the stage for his future successes. If you're a fan of his work, this film is a must-watch. And even if you're not familiar with Nolan, Following stands on its own as a gripping and thrilling piece of cinema. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 10/10.1080p presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.DTS HD-MA 5.1 & LPCM mono audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Good, LFE content: GoodMOOFIEMETER: 9/10."
"Review of Following : As a starting point it's a decent neo-noir flick.
Nolan had to start somewhere and it was quite a unique start indeed."
"Review of Following : A debut movie of a great filmmaker is either a stinker (""Alien 3"", David Fincher) or a statement that he is there to stay. (""Reservoir Dogs"", Quentin Tarantino and ""Following"", Christopher Nolan). ""Following"" is a very well made film, considering the circumstances under which it was made. The film is, in fact, a rulebook or a template of future Nolan films. Most of his future movies can be found in ""Following"" in the sense that most of his future movies have - broken timeline and non linear storytelling making the movie more thrilling, crime or criminal-ish adventure, manipulation of people and a surprising reveal, that's either mindblowing or in the case of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012), studio's insistence. This movie is a crime thriller. Keeping away the circumstances and knowing nothing about other Nolan films, it's very good. Not excellent, not great, but simply very good. The pacing of the story feels rushed. There is character development but the pacing is so quick that we do not have enough time to get invested in the characters. Some things about the protagonist are simply addressed in the story by the characters in it, rather than telling it dramatically. The fight scenes and some acts of violence are a bit poorly choreographed. However, the suspense was excellent and the twists were mind blowing. Consider now, that you have watched Nolan's other movies as well. The rushed pace was inevitable for a movie which wanted to deliver a lot, but had only an hour of runtime. The issues with fight scenes and acts of violence are still the same, however, we can get a clue of how things played out off screen when a character addresses something about the protagonist. It's like the future Nolan films made it better. If you've seen any of his future movies containing a theme of manipulation, it's quite easy to figure out. The awesomeness of the suspense and the twists are retained. At last, consider that you also know how this movie got made. Man! It was lucky even to see the day! A budget of $6000 during the 90s for British film? It's probably gonna be forgettable. It might not be as good as it was supposed to be if it got a made under favorable circumstances, but surely ain't forgettable. I don't find it appropriate myself, but this movie is a masterpiece - in the sense that an almost no budget flick was made to be so good! I have seen other almost no budget films like ""A Fistful of Fingers"" (1995 or so) made by Edgar Wright, and it was just plain bad for me. I would never watch such films ever again, except for this one and any other such film, if I find them in the future. It was my fifth Nolan movie. I watched all three of his Batman movies, and I absolutely loved the second one, the first one was excellent and the third one was just good. Then I watched ""Memento"" (2000) which made me a Nolan fan. But it was this movie that made me appreciate him as a filmmaker in the way I do today. Judging it in a plain manner, I would give it an ""8/10"" and an ""A-"". But, for the reasons explained in this review, it gets a special ""10/10"" and an ""A+""."
"Review of Following : Following is the directorial debut of Christopher Nolan. As it was made on almost no budget with unprofessional actors, I was not expecting much. The protagonist is a young writer who has resorted to stalking people that he finds interesting so as to pass his time. On one particular day, the guy that he was stalking confronted him and questioned the reason for why he was stalking. Both of them begin to break into other people's home and just try to guess the type of people that lived there.Despite the lack of professional actors, it never feels as if the acting is poor due to the well rehearsed scenes. According to Nolan, all of them had rehearsed every scene so well that the majority of the movie had scenes which were filmed in the first or second take.To make a movie without any distributor is courageous and a bit of a gamble. However, Nolan took the risk and today he is among the most well known directors in the world. Do not go into this movie for viewing a technical masterpiece because it isn't. However, if you are looking for a compelling story with a stellar ending, this movie is right for you."
"Review of Following : Not for me at allI rate it so low because this type of movie is absolutely not geared toward me, I found it boring and I simply wasn't interested, within that, there are some positives that I want to highlight.There are some really good scenes of Dialogue, the apparent 6k budget is beyond impressive to make a movie of this quality. The story is good but not enough for me, seems a bit all over the place it's about a young writer who follows people for inspiration that is found by a thief who takes him under his wing.Yea not for me unfortunately and it's bottom of the Nolan barrel, a good directorial debut to say the least just not my cup of tea, 5/10."
