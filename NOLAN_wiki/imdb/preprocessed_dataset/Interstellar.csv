"Review of Interstellar : After watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 I swore to god I will wait 5 years to watch it again so I get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again
This without doubt is THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE"
"Review of Interstellar : Sometimes I just need to see the start. Or end. Or a trailer. Or the music and theme from Hans Zimmer. Or the whole movie. Just to feel that thing, I only get from this movie. That the earth, space and time are something special, mystical. I never forget the first time I saw this movie, in an IMAX theatre in 2014. I was struck by it. Totally got me. And it stil does, 7 years later. This is the best movie ever made for me. Because of the feeling it gives me, no other movie can. So hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie. Brilliant."
"Review of Interstellar : A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ..."
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that."
"Review of Interstellar : Amongst the best movies of all time. The story, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the effects, the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 10/10's.But what beats all of that is Hans Zimmers compositions. How he continues to churn out perfection to the senses is mindblowing."
"Review of Interstellar : This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100."
"Review of Interstellar : I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!"
"Review of Interstellar : I think just about everything has been said about this film now. But, I can still tell you what this masterpiece is to me. To me, this movie is possibly the most relevant movie ever, because it questions our own humanity relative to the Universe. Whether that's our ability to love, think, or persevere and walk into the unknown. We are explorers, and curious at heart. This untameable curiosity is not our end, but our beginning. It is what advanced this civilization and it will continue to do so. So never, never let anybody tell you that we shouldn't look towards the stars and wonder, because that's what makes us human. Without this stargazing we are merely animals, accepting our fate in the dust..."
Review of Interstellar : A science-fiction masterpiece. Nolan executes a marvelous direction that slowly but efficiently puts in place a dark world creating a necessity to save humanity. Add to that great performances from Nolan and Hathaway plus a great score from Hans Zimmer. The result is on the best science-fiction movies of all time.
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar - ReviewCertain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me.Why you might ask?Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes. .. .Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :)."
Review of Interstellar : All is amazing. I can't describe anything. It's a film that leads you to think about yourself and your plans in your life. I am a real series/movies' lover and... This was awesome.
"Review of Interstellar : I hadn't seen this but movie and caught it on a flight back from the DR. 
One of my favorite movies of all time. I would give the first half of the movie an 11/10, just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi/ thriller(in the sense of so much always being on the line). I loved the acting and just yeah, a great movie and one you should go see if you never have"
"Review of Interstellar : I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly ""X"", will managed to convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought."
"Review of Interstellar : There is not even a single day I don't think of this movie, it's scenes , it has a profound impact on me and it shall remain with me forever."
Review of Interstellar : THIS IS A MANKIND ACHIEVEMENT.THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE.IS ANYONE HAS DOUBT?
"Review of Interstellar : The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar. Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push ! ""*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.Félix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014"
"Review of Interstellar : 'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date."
"Review of Interstellar : Hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only Earth, but also to oust us have been popular with moviegoers. Typically, like the European explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the Western Hemisphere during the 15th century, these extraterrestrials—either bug-eyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have drifted across the cosmos—show up to evict or absorb us. ""Inception"" director Christopher Nolan's latest extravaganza ""Interstellar,"" toplining Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow, is a superior space opera that reverses the action. Earthlings must abandon mother Earth because an environmental blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in overpopulated continents. No, ""Interstellar"" doesn't pit Earth against multi-colored ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" aliens or immaculate looking storm troopers in white outfits from the ""Star Wars"" and ""Hunger Games"" franchises. Instead, the ""Interstellar"" scientist heroes must search for a new home for humankind. Rather than an outlandish adventure epic with evil extraterrestrials, ""Interstellar"" qualifies as an intelligent, realistic, sometimes provocative, sci-fi saga similar to Stanley Kubrick's landmark movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Mind you, Nolan doesn't chronicle mankind's evolution from the dawn of time the way Kubrick did in as ""2001."" The casts of ""Interstellar"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" differ, too. Kubrick relied on an unknown cast, while ""Interstellar"" boasts a charismatic array of superstars. If you haven't seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" you won't appreciate some of the clever allusions to the legendary 1968 film. Anybody who has seen ""2001"" will be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out of an airlock. Ultimately, the most obvious ""2001"" references in ""Interstellar"" are those bizarre, oblong, Minecraft-style robots that resemble the black monoliths in Kubrick's film. Some of the sci-fi terminology may fly over your head, but Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science fiction ideas. They focus on relevant contemporary themes, such as father & daughter relationships and the environment. They forge interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder long after the movie. ""Interstellar"" occurs in the late 21st century, after things have waxed really wretched. Bad enough that farmers can grow only corn. Blight has destroyed wheat and okra. Public opinion about NASA has curdled. History textbooks have been rewritten. Everybody believes NASA faked the Apollo moon landings to bankrupt the Soviet Union. A former NASA test pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey of ""Mud""), has turned to farming and reaped rewards where many others have failed. Although his wife died from a brain cyst that an MRI could have detected had an MRI had been available, Cooper perseveres as a farmer and a father of two children, his fifteen-year old son Tom (Timothée Chalamet of ""Worse Friends""), and his precious ten-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy of ""The Conjuring"") who adore him. Cooper and his kids live with his father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow of ""Terms of Endearment""), and they contend with tumultuous dust storms on a daily basis. These dust storms recall the Depression Era drought and dust storms of that prompted millions to flee from the plains states. Dust gets into everything, and Donald wages a never-ending war to keep everything clean. Meanwhile, books have been toppling randomly from Murph's bedroom bookcase. She suspects a ghost is responsible, but nothing ghoulish like ""Paranormal Activity."" Naturally, Cooper dismisses the presence of ghosts. One day after a particularly turbulent dust storm, father and daughter examine the way the books have fallen out of the shelves, translate it into code, and come up with coordinates that lead them to a classified NORAD facility. A monolithic robot named Tars confronts them. Later, Murph and Cooper find themselves sitting around a table talking with high-ranking NASA officials. One of them is Professor Brand (Michael Caine of ""Batman Begins""), and Brand confides in Cooper that the world is living on borrowed time. Moreover, he tells him about the 'Lazarus' project. NASA has dispatched manned missions to other parts of the galaxy to find a new home for mankind. He convinces Cooper to sign on as a pilot for one last launch that will take his daughter, biologist Amelia (Oscar winning actress Anne Hathaway of ""Les Misérables); physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley of ""The Hunger Games""); and two robots TARS (voice of Bill Irwin) and CASE (voice of Josh Stewart) deep into space to a recently discovered wormhole which will enable them to explore new worlds. Predictably, Murph isn't happy about her father's departure. During their flight to the wormhole, Cooper and company lose contact with Earth, but Professor Brand can still transmit messages. Gradually, however, things take a turn for the worst. The final quarter hour of ""Interstellar"" will absolutely boggle your mind. Cooper goes where no man has gone before in a desperate bid to save mankind! ""Interstellar"" is a serious sci-fi movie. The computer-generated visual effects are nothing short of dazzling, and Nolan orchestrates the flight sequences so we don't hear any sounds in the vacuum of outer space. The different spacecraft and the Endurance mother ship look as authentic as the outfits that our heroes wear. The strange but new worlds that they encounter during their search to locate a new Earth are breathtaking. One world consists of an eternal sea with towering waves that loom like mountain ranges, while another is as stark and icy as it is inhospitable. The theme of deception runs throughout ""Interstellar."" The faked Apollo moon landing and Dr. Brand's mind-blowing revelation are a few surprises that will maintain your interest throughout ""Interstellar."" Nolan generates several suspenseful set-pieces that will keep you poised on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon has a startling cameo as another astronaut who has succumbed to effects of isolation. Clocking in at 169 minutes, ""Interstellar"" amounts to an unforgettable epic with intense white-knuckled suspense, top-notch performances, and a terrific ending."
"Review of Interstellar : I rate this movie 11/10 to signify it's greatness. Perfection. Mind-blowing. A workout for your brain. I want to have debates about it. I want to write research papers on it. Amazingly unbelievably awesome. This is the kind of movie that opens up your mind. Lots of amazing scenes with epic music. A killer story told flawlessly. Perfect directing by the best ever. Great cast with great acting. A deep psychological aspect explored for numerous characters.The most renowned theoretical physicist who is an expert on cosmology was brought on to keep the science honest, as well as a retired astronaut who's been to space five times. One of the rare movies that is better the second, and even the third time watching. The only movie I have ever liked the most the fourth time. I keep picking up on more things and a better overall understanding. So many parts are extremely moving and powerful. It does an awesome job of making you feel what the characters are feeling.EDIT on tenth viewing: This movie destroys me every time. Numerous tears EVERY TIME. And I don't just mean at the obvious emotional parts. There are so many moments where I am in complete awe at the beauty of the filmmaking I'm experiencing, to the point of tears. The way the story all comes together and the ""epiphany moment"" is so perfect that it brings me to tears.When watching movies, I sometimes think, ""this is the best thing I've ever seen"" or ""this is the coolest thing I've ever seen."" I know it's hyperbole and I've said it many times, usually at one or maybe two scenes in a movie. During Interstellar, I feel this way for about 40% of this three hour movie. Every time I watch, it re-emphasizes that it is CLEARY my favorite movie of all-time. And that musical score alone gives me goosebumps for so much of the movie. Hans is the GOAT. Nolan is the GOAT.(10 viewings, 12/2/2016, 2/26/2020, 1/11/2022, 8/9/2023)SPOILERSI was randomly thinking about Interstellar, haven't watched it in at least 6 months. I thought about one hypothetical that intrigued me: what if the tesseract is such that it can only be placed inside an already collapsed black hole. If plan B was what ""originally"" happened and Dr. Brand survived, future people figured it out, and they want to save those they left behind on earth, they need to find a love-link between someone who goes into a black hole and someone on earth smart enough to be able to solve the gravity problem = Cooper and Murph. Doctor Brand knows this because she knows Cooper loves Murph, knows he sacrifices himself by falling into the black hole, knows Murph grows up to be her dad's understudy, so she has the future people (eventually, after her death) put the machine in the same black hole that Cooper falls into, thereby making the entire plan work. INTRIGUING. Will need to confirm on next viewing... after watching again, I like this as a viable theory, but it conflicts with another theory I had about the ""original"" mission being completed without Cooper.Lots of awesome concepts that made me think, like Murphy's Law not applying close to a black hole, human survival instincts and it encompassing your children, love being a quantifiable scientific force, the black hole and time relativity. The robots are cool and original. Really awesome visuals of things I've wondered about but never really imagined. I liked the depiction of the 5 dimensions in 3D in the daughter's room. The way everything connected is very awesome. The different planets are so interesting with ice clouds and giant tidal waves. The endings are perfect.Something I noticed that I didn't realize the first time is the reason his son became dark and a little crazy. He was still a good person, even after experiencing the death of his son, Jesse. However, once his wife convinced him to let go of the idea that his father was coming back, he gave up on everything in life and became a horrible husband, father and brother.The relationship between Coop and Murph is the best relationship I can remember in any movie I've seen. The primary underlying theme in the movie is the love between a father and his daughter being able to transcend space and time, which is the key to her getting the information she needs to save the world.From Interstellar group chat discussion:-Or the other theory I had was that originally plan B was the one that worked and a colony survived and eventually was able to do what they did and wanted to save all the people that ended up dying on earth and try to make plan A work-So she finds out that plan a was a sham. That the professor had already solved the equation years ago before she even met him. That he knew even with solving the equation that they couldn't figure out how to get the people off earth. She found out they knew they were never coming back and they were going to let everyone on earth to die. So every day since she was 10 that she has been hoping her father would come home was a lie. She should have never been hoping. Her entire 20 years that she dedicated her life to working on this was a complete waste. That should break a person. Murph is a beast.-The love between them was the only reason the world ended up being saved. It's the only reason she kept trying that hard after all those years. It's the only reason she went back to her house in her room. It's the only reason she saw the watch again. It's the only reason she figured out that the watch twitching was her dad sending the data.12/2/16: I watched interstellar again wow. I found a flaw in my theory that in the original timeline they used Plan B without Cooper, and then when they became advanced they went back to try to get Cooper so they could save the people that died on earth. The problem is, how would they have gotten past the problems with re-docking onto the spinning blown up ship after Mann backstabbed humanity. But it actually makes perfect sense because in the original timeline Cooper would not have convinced them to go to Mann's planet, Brand would have convinced them to go to Edmund's planet which was the right one. In that ""original"" timeline, love still saved humanity since it helped her choose the right planet."
"Review of Interstellar : The ones that you still think of weeks even months later. The ones that make you think and leave you breathless. The ones that inspire you to want to change your life after a mere two and a half hours.I watched this movie the first time over a month and a half ago and it still crops up in my mind. The thought of space travel excites me along with countless others and this movie has literally made me rethink my life choices and pushed me into wanting to become an astronaut. As childish as it sounds, its true, because its one of those movies. Interstellar has become my new favourite movie by far.Bravo Nolan what a great human bean"
"Review of Interstellar : This movie is no doubt the best I've ever scene this movie gives you everything emotions,love,hype,excitement,etc..
In my opinion this is the best movie made by Christopher nolan. The ending is so good that I had to watch it twice I loved this movie so much and tbh I don't think any movie will Top this one for me ."
"Review of Interstellar : The fate of humanity rests in the hands of a small number of NASA pilots, who travel through a work hole in search of a new home.I've only watched it for the second time, the first being when it first arrived on the big screen. My opinion hasn't altered since the viewing, it's an epic masterpiece, the story holds up remarkably well, but the acting and visuals all contribute to make this film something very special.The story is remarkably good, it's cohesive, well balanced, it makes sense.Matthew McConaughey's best film role still for me, he's awesome as the lead character, superbly supported by both Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine, it really is a well made epic.The visuals, the special effects are all tremendous, and have held up as the years have gone past, it remains one of the most incredibly beautiful visual films of all time.Epic 10/10."
"Review of Interstellar : Love is the one thing that transcends time and space... New creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured. I was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness. Starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of ""Endurance"" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself.The emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in ""Interstellar"" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere.The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the ""Space Odyssey"" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar.Hans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: ""Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children"", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself. Visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The ""Endurance"" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's ""Odyssey"", and they are pleasing to the eye.Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life. ""Interstellar"" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values ​​and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again. ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light."""
"Review of Interstellar : The earth is plagued with droughts, famines and other apocalyptic disasters. Mankind must find a way to leave planet earth once and for all. An earth-like planet has been discovered in another solar system. A spaceship can travel fast through a wormhole though interstellar space but can Cooper get there and return to earth in time to see his daughter before she grows too old?The Aging of Murph vs her father Cooper the answer is relativity playing a factor in aging - how fast time runs depend on the relative position of the observer and the subject.Incredible movie - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!10/10"
"Review of Interstellar : Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!"
"Review of Interstellar : Set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer growing corn. His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth.This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension, including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration.Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of '2001 – A Space Odyssey' although this has more emotion to it than that classic."
"Review of Interstellar : A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival.Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a ""Hathaway hater"" like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in ""Wild"".This may be the greatest ever film about physics."
"Review of Interstellar : (This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar."
"Review of Interstellar : So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take:To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good.Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time.Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop.One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released.After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown.Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us."
"Review of Interstellar : A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. I heard that this was called ""the most scientifically accurate movie"" and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time, but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie - McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more. The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. But, if your braincells don't shut off and you don't expect another Die Hard movie, you will appreciate this masterpiece."
"Review of Interstellar : Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think."
"Review of Interstellar : A fiction on facts, how our existence is driven..
An amazing storyline to define time, dimensions and how mathematics makes our survival. Its a story for our next generation to harp on.
Cheers to the makers. Must watch !!"
"Review of Interstellar : I have waited long before watching this movie. The length of this movie scared me, so I kept postponing watching it. Recently, my fellow students kept reminding me that Interstellar is a must-see, so I tried.I can say one thing: postponing was a mistake. This movie is such a masterpiece. Everything is spot on. The thing I love the most is the music. Hans Zimmer killed it again. Without his compositions this movie would not have worked. The visuals are also beautiful. I never thought a sci-fi movie would feel so real.In short, I can honestly say I would recommend this movie. It is a must-see."
"Review of Interstellar : Watched it again 10 years later. Absolutely brilliant.For sure a bit overwhelming if you are into space exploration and stuff but very well made.If you are not fully invested you will probably lose the plot so keep that in mind. Acting is incredible of course and visuals are stunning.What takes 1 point for me is the ending. And no, I'm not talking about the black hole. It would've been great if that was the final scene.Anyways, if you are wondering ""should I watch this movie"" the answer is - absolutely, but only if you are fully prepared to be engaged all the time. It's a rollercoaster movie and it will stay with you for a while."
"Review of Interstellar : Well to me this was one of the better science-fiction movies that I ever saw. It's been a long time since I didn't see a sci-fi like this one. It's extremely long but you won't get bored for a second. And that says enough about it. All the actors gave us a very good performance and some shots were stunning. The story was very well written even though sometimes too complicated to understand but then again who are we to understand anything about the unknown dimensions, black holes or wormholes. You have got to stay concentrated during the whole movie to understand the story but like I said before with Interstellar it is certainly not a problem at all. I was completely absorbed by the story and was actually surprised that time flew by so easily. One of the better movies I watched this year and certainly the best sci-fi in years."
"Review of Interstellar : INTERSTELLAR (2014) ***1/2 Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Mackenzie Foy, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, William Devane, Leah Cairns, Topher Grace, Timothy Chalamet, Brooke Smith (voice of Bill Irwin) Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (and to his daughter) continues his streak of audacious sense of space (literally) and the inner human spirit : set in the bleak future Earth is on the descent of humanity with continuous food demands and climate change with one Hail Mary of a plan by NASA - send a small crew thru a wormhole (just go with it) to see if 'they' can help us. A grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining moment of cool-as-a-cucumber and deeply felt performance by McConaughey as the astronaut/pilot of the journey into the realms of desperation, anchoring the film with a transfixing turn (largely due to his interplay with young talented actress Foy as his daughter - later played with clear-eyed intensity by Chastain), no easy task with all the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing cousin to GRAVITY for sheer amazement (one must see it on a big screen and IMAX would be a start as it was filmed in the medium). Hathaway has a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad Caine (a Nolan regular). The true stars are the breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, a stellar score by frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer and fantastic visual effects by literally dozens of geniuses. The only stumbling block is its slightly heavy handed message getting across but the Twilight Zone-ish final act makes up for it in spades. WOW!"
"Review of Interstellar : Went to see the film Wednesday evening. Overall it was an enjoyable film from start to finish with the help of humor along the way. Excellent casting, descent visuals, and a good sound score. There were times I felt the music was overkill and would drown out certain scenes but overall well done. Story meshed real well too and threw in a few curve balls.I would have liked to see some better visuals from space. Especially when they arrived in the new solar system. Been cool to have seen unique planets of different colors orbiting each other for instance. Something unique to stamp the distance and uniqueness from our system. Trivial but it's those small things :)"
"Review of Interstellar : Christopher Nolan directs an enthralling space odyssey, co-written with his brother Jonathan. This movie lives up to the hype and is one not to be missed. The earth is chocking as it is a starving Dirt Bowl. The future is dim as farmers are producing less and less to feed the population. Cooper(Matthew McConaughey)is a former test pilot and widower raising two children, fifteen year old Tom(Timothee Chalamet) and ten year old Murph(Mackenzie Foy), who is suspended from school for fighting. She refuses to believe the school books being right, saying the Apollo missions were faked in order to bankrupt Russia's space program.Cooper and daughter stumble across the remnants of the believed to be defunct NASA, where Professor Brand(Michael Caine) convinces Cooper he is the only one to command a mission to be launched into space in search of a new planet that can sustain life. The flight must enter a wormhole that will warp time, but allow a crew to rescue data from explorers, who preceded them. A member of Cooper's mission is Brand's daughter(Anne Hathaway). Deep on the mind of Cooper's daughter is the fact that if and when her father makes it back to earth, he will be the same age or older than her due to the time warp.No little green men, no aliens in sight. There are a couple of highly intelligent computerized robots, so to speak. Visually awesome and enhanced by Hans Zimmer's score. McConaughey seems driven and invested. Young Miss Foy is very watchable. And Jessica Chastain is excellent in the role of the adult Murph. Also in the cast: John Lithgow, Wes Bently, Matt Damon, William Devane, Casey Affleck and Ellen Burstyn. Plus the voices of Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart. INTERSTELLAR is stellar!"
"Review of Interstellar : I found Intestellar a beautiful movie to watch and be enthralled by. After countless low grade science fiction movies parading across the screen over the decades, this one will stay with me. The viewer should watch it for story and not for the science - the cinematography is beautiful without being flashy; the acting is brilliant and musical score works perfectly with the story.I was engrossed by the movie from start to finish, held there by the humanity and feeling portrayed by the director and the actors.Why people feel the need to compare Intestellar to Kubrick's 2001 is puzzling - this is a completely different movie and one that, when I think back to watching 2001, is infinitely more watchable.Why people feel the need to pile in rate the movie '1' is beyond me and, at the time of this writing 570,000 people had averaged the rating out to 8.7 - so, don't listen to the hate, just watch it and enjoy."
"Review of Interstellar : At over 2100 reviews at the time of this writing, I guess there's nothing left to be said other than my opinion.I'd probably need a PhD in Physics from MIT to understand half of the technological terms in the movie, but I still found it to be rather awesome. After reading some of the reviews here, I think a lot of people are taking this sci-fi fantasy tale way too seriously and literally.Christopher Nolan's latest, which he co-wrote as well with his brother Jonathan, at 2 hrs and 48 min in length, can be ridiculously absurd one moment then quickly turn into riveting action the next.Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway lead a long list of screen notables here, too numerous to mention. I did want to mention that I thought Mackenzie Foy, as Murph, the 10-year-old daughter of McConaughy was terrific in her role.I thought the musical score here was excellent, the wit and humor of the robot TARS (Bill Irwin) was on target. the special effects could be rather hokey at times but then other times were amazing, and the movie did contain a number of twists and turns which I liked.All in all, despite its' drawbacks I found this sci-fi fantasy to be a rather awesome and epic ride."
"Review of Interstellar : It may very well be the most remarkable film I've ever seen. Interstellar is a film which plays on your emotions more than anything else. Many people get caught up in the plot holes and the scientific inaccuracies, and thus, let these factors detract from what would otherwise be an incredible cinematic experience. Interstellar is a film to completely surrender yourself to - and let the sheer grandiosity and emotionality move you. Forget logic, forget science. This is art in its most fantastical and overwhelming form. A father's heart breaks as he realizes he's broken his daughter's heart - He has left her and does not know when he'll return. Nolan pulls every string in our heart with the emotion of the father- daughter relationship set against the backdrop of interstellar travel to save the human race. Interstellar will, I feel, become more appreciated as time passes, and will, I hope, one day be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made."
"Review of Interstellar : I was very interested in this movie, my expectations were very high, luckily I have been satisfied! I can't say it's a masterpiece because I found something that could have been better ( there's an apparent hole plot and some characters could have been realized better) The plot is very difficult and articulated, science is really complicated! Besides movie is very long, but it can not bore, rhythm grows up to the end. The photography is breakthaking, scenes are spectacular and do you not fell the long-duration! screenplay is fantastic, music is fundamental for the movie ( Hans Zimmer composed a fabulous soundtrack ). The special effects are perfect, worthy of an Oscar! Unfortunately, in my opinion, Interstellar has not had the attentions it deserves it's a film you have to see! 9/10 absolutely! not to be missed!"
"Review of Interstellar : I know that Interstellar is a sci-fi movie, not just that, but it's also based on theories made by scientist Kip Thorne, actually that's what makes this movie special to many people. Also, the movie shows the most accurate simulation of wormholes and black holes.But the real reason why people feel touched by this movie is the emotions represented by the Cooper-Murph relationship, Brand-Edmunds relationship and Dr.Mann's courage turned into cowardliness. All of these complicated emotions are the foundation of this movie. People may forget all about relativity, wormholes and black holes, but they will never forget the touchy moments through the movie when their tears silently came out.When I compare Interstellar with Inception, I find that the idea of Inception is more original and more creative, while the emotions in Interstellar are far more effective. Both are masterpieces from the great filmmaker, Christopher Nolan, whom I thank for all of his original and unforgettable movies."
"Review of Interstellar : Yup Nolan did it again and this time he has taken his movie to another dimension.!!'Interstellar' is the story of a man trying to save his family and then saving humanity from extinction. Its full of space adventure and breath-taking actions on some of the most beautiful and unrealistic locations around the UNIVERSE. To realize Nolan's master-piece it Is better if polish our ideas about space-time theory. We know space is defined in 3 dimensions and Einstein in his theory of relativity uses Time as the 4th dimension. But Scientists in the movie realize that Gravity has the tendency to flow across all these 4 dimensions and thus Gravity is designated to be the Fifth Dimension. It is believed that whoever holds to understand and master the knowledge of this 5 dimensions will be able to move anywhere in Time and Space. In this movie a certain species referred as ""THEY"" has the knowledge of this five dimensions and it is THEM who wants Humans to save themselves.In the film various Scientific and Astronomical theories are used, and it will help if viewers have a brief idea about them too.Murphy's law- It is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as: Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. A statement relating possibilities with Certainty.Worm hole- It is a bridge, a hypothetical topological feature of space-time that would fundamentally be a shortcut through space-time. A wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends, each in separate points in space-time. Though undiscovered, Some believe that wormhole could be used to travel through galaxies.Black hole- It is a region of space-time from which gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Inside the hole what happens is still a mystery, and that's where Nolan's creativity brings about.The movie is filled with unproved theories and unrealistic scenarios. But the way Nolan has directed it, you wont want to blink you eyes even for a moment. The graphics are, no doubt, marvelous. The cast did a stupendous job and . Though laws has been broken to keep the ending sweet, it is well deserved as LOVE has no rules and no dimensions.Conclusion: Watch it again and again.. and it gets better and better.!"
"Review of Interstellar : This is the best movie, which blends the time travel and lot of information into a single script, it takes me 3 times to get the story completely. The director have moved the story in a nice way which makes the people to think before they can watch the movie. This also made me to think of ""Is there really a 5th dimension??"". Sure if you watch it deeply you can never get out of the concept unless you are fully aware of the story before you see. The screenplay was really outstanding and provided the best visual. Sound - nothing to mention, it was really awesome. And about the cast, they were excellent and blend nicely into the character. Lets hope there is a sequel to this movie which suggest how she solved the equation with her fathers help and it may help me to get the story to full end. This is really challenging story and I will be waiting for its sequel."
"Review of Interstellar : I'm a big fan of anything Sci-Fi and I've always been interested in the boundaries that directors push when it comes to imagining the impossible and predicting or presenting the future on screen. While most science fiction films step over into the fantastical and often prioritize the ""Fi"" over the ""Sci"", Interstellar is one of those rare gems that balances the two elements and also delivers a spectacularly entertaining movie.Any doubts I had going into the film about a dramatic SciFi being directed by Christopher Nolan were instantly muted as soon as the movie and its tremendous score began. While Nolan excelled with The Prestige and Inception, they did leave something to be desired and I was fresh off the Batman trilogy bandwagon. But Nolan excels yet again, directing the film with such confidence and control that it's almost impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. Each and every aspect of his signature style is also prominently visible through the film.Continue reading the review at my blog below:https://microreels.wordpress.com/2015/11/25/interstellar-film- review/"
Review of Interstellar : I have already lost count of the times I have seen this movie and I am still fascinated by the beautiful soundtrack and the immensity of each frame

Review of Interstellar : You will be on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. Masterpiece! The only thing i regret is that I did not see it in the movie theaters
"Review of Interstellar : I watched this incredible movie almost 10-11 time. Not just I loved this movie, the reason for watching this film is the concept that Sir Christopher Nolan presented in this movie. The way he plotted every scene is just heart touching and must gave the viewers goosbumps, The concept of Dimensions and blackhole, time it just awesome. As a physics lover this is the perfect movie for them who love physics and also persue there career on physics must watch this movie."
"Review of Interstellar : To this day , many people still talk a lot about Christopher Nolan's ""Batman""-trilogy, but here is his newest work: ""Interstellar"". He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuarón with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate.This is like our generation's ""Armageddon"", only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. The lead character is played by Matthew McConaughey, whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an Academy Award win. ""Interstellar"" is much more than Sci-Fi though. I personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. The water planet sequence was incredibly well done. And right afterward, when Cooper (McConaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents, it is truly moving as well. I had a lump in my throat just like I did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. The inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first, but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really.Then, I also had a love-hate relationship with the Matt Damon parts. I found it pretty boring to be honest initially, but when we found out about his true intentions, it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. Nicely done. When Caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on, I felt there could be something fishy (like with Pixar's Up) there and yes it was. The ending of the movie with Hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. Saving Private... ehh I mean Dr. Brand. Who knows? The time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. Somehow, the NASA lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in American school books. It is some point in the future. That much we know. David Oyelowo plays a small role here as one of the teachers. He has ""Selma"" in the race for an Academy Award nomination this year.The ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion, but I still liked it. The whole ghost explanation about Cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. The effects are brilliant of course, but that does not really need be mentioned for Nolan movies. A given. Hans Zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from McConaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. Anyway, I found the film interesting enough that I found it a bit sad they did not get to visit the third planet (with Hathaway's character's lover), only the water planet and the ice planet. I'd have loved to see that. However, maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. The movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. It could have run for another hour and I probably would not have been bored. There really was hardly anything wrong with it. Affleck's character did not do too much for me. He wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to Chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to Cooper. John Lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always.This is one of the movies I really recommend to watch, preferably on the big screen due to its sensational visual aspects. It's also good for a rewatch I believe, also to evaluate the characters' actions, especially Caine's for example. And the story of course. I believe, after one viewing, I am still far away from having understood everything that was going on, especially the scientific aspects. That however, does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. If you are interested in space, you really have to see this too. It has distant planets, wormholes, black holes, spaceships and a lot more. Let me finish this review with two little snippets: First, the actress who played Murph as a child was the same that played Renesmee in the last two Twilight movies and, secondly, that fittingly Hathaway's character was called Amelia like the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. That can't be coincidence, can it? Especially with her last shot."
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar is a interesting film that questions the time in space in our reality a film that is straight up visually impressive The story is kind of odd but it's still worth in this type of film ever since I saw this movie I've been wondering what's up in space what type of life we can live on space and how is humans can evolve it the only thing that I did not really like was the main character being very one dimensional, but other than that this has a very good premise, and they will pay the movie that has a very good set up and pay off real well the performance was very very good and direction was... well it's Christopher Nolan 8.5/10."
"Review of Interstellar : Having destroyed all resources on the planet, like a rapacious, insatiable gannet, it's time to move on, to vacate and be gone, find a new place to rampage and beset. But where can you take all the people, to build their new churches and steeples, and how to get there, if you can find somewhere, without a breakthrough in science and maths rules.Juxtaposing a more than probabilistic forecast of things to come with the absurd, to produce a wholly engaging and imaginative piece of sci-fi that may well get you thinking of what might just happen to the planet and the people of it when the help and support of as yet undiscovered dimensions fails to materialise.Great performances, great effects, leaves you wanting to revisit 2001: A Space Odyssey but you know you'll never know why."
"Review of Interstellar : This movie felt like it tried to accomplish two simultaneous and somewhat incompatible endeavors.First, it was thought-provoking. Many questions were raised. What would life on earth be like if our climate runs amok? What happens to government when we all have to live hand-to-mouth? Are ""they"" out there communicating with us? Is it the essence of humanity to survive, or is it to pioneer, and, by extension, evolve? Second, it was also an adventure. I watched this in a full IMAX theater, with eighty bajillion watts of Super Thunder-Round Sound, or whatever the kids call it now. The visual effects definitely shine on the IMAX screen. The format switches occasionally, and usually imperceptibly, between 70mm for the scenes with dialogue, to IMAX format for that full-on dose of retina-overload spectacle. This movie is a wonderfully fun ride through a strangely familiar extra-galactic world. There are also plenty of tense moments, after which you realize you've been holding your breath.I'm glad I went to watch this. That said, I think the film suffers a little from trying to be both an adventure thrill about the dangers of space travel, let alone an actual confrontation with a nemesis, and also a multi-layered allegory involving the dimensional tangle of time, gravity, love, and what it means to survive.It asks more questions than it explores. While it fills in for the missing answers with white-knuckled brushes with death, it wasn't as intellectually satisfying as I hoped. I spent an hour discussing the thoughtful components with a friend. In the end, we were grasping to find symbolism, metaphors, or other messages about humanity. We never coalesced ""the message"" of the movie.But did we need to? It was, as I said, also a thrill ride. The adventurous climax was a little less than terrifyingly dramatic; I can't say I had the same post-climactic cathartic experience as I've had for other movies. But it was a definite end, closing most of the open plot points. I certainly felt moved by the characters' resolutions.I was suspicious that Matthew McConaughey could convince me that he was a space-ready engineer; it turns out that he didn't need to, because he did convince me that he was a dad that loved his children as much as any dad could. I think all the leads delivered solidly: Caine, Lithgow, Hathaway, Damon, Chastain, Affleck... I connected with the characters and felt their pain and happiness.Hans Zimmer played up the drama in the music a little heavily, I thought, and unnecessarily. It wound up creating the opposite of the effect I think he intended. Many of the scenes could have used a lighter touch, musically. Some of them worked brilliantly.Although I had my quibbles, the final analysis is that I would definitely choose to watch the movie a second time, but I'm not making plans to, for now."
"Review of Interstellar : Uh-oh, here I go again. The movie's out, what, a week or so as I write this, and IMDb voters have it ranked the 11th best movie of all time!!?? If there's justice in a rational world this would never happen. But it's not a rational world anymore now, is it, when an MIT professor can be found on tape explaining how the President's signature health care law was built on lies and deceit, and the media isn't even interested in covering the story.I could rant on but what's the point. I guess if your name is Nolan, any movie that comes out with the director's fingerprints on it will be hailed as monumental. I don't have a beef with Nolan personally, I think he makes some visually fantastic films (this is one to be sure), but most of the time I think the hype precedes the product and then everyone else falls in line singing the praises.Case in point - ""Interstellar"". Nominally a sci-fi thriller, the picture devolves into something of a time travel anomaly that leaves the viewer scratching their head when hero Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) finds himself on the wrong side of the bookshelves in one of the picture's pivotal moments. I'm sitting there thinking 'this is what I came to see the movie for'? I'm not even going to start on Coop's selection to save the planet just by showing up at Professor Brand's (Michael Caine) facility. Which by the way, didn't it start out as some shack in the desert? When we get a tour of the place, it's got NASA central looking like a global conglomerate.Speaking of which, how is it NASA's still around for this massive undertaking to repatriate all of Earth's citizens to another planet? Unless I'm mistaken, NASA's primary goal now is Muslim outreach and all the best and brightest brains have farmed out. My head is starting to hurt.It was a small theater crowd last night, and I usually don't do this, but since a gentleman ahead of me held the door as I filed out, I asked him what he thought of the movie. His exact words were ""That was a piece of excrement"", only he used the more colloquially popular term for excrement. I wouldn't go that far, but if one hour in the wormhole equals seven years of Earth time, you're going to get old real fast trying to understand this picture."
"Review of Interstellar : As I begin this review of Christopher Nolan's latest movie, I want to point out the gorgeous visuals that we as an audience were able to behold with Interstellar. I truly believe this to be the movie's best quality and a true feat for the people in charge of visual effects. Having said this, I believe that many viewers were divisive over the plot's complexities. In fact, this is the most emotion driven movie I've seen from Nolan, something that he isn't ultimately known for. Nolan's strenght as a director lies in his ability to present us with a vision. He is meticulous and works the technical aspect of a film like no other director today. Once again, this is proved in every frame shot for Interstellar. So leaving behind my long praise, I now redirect this review to the story.The earth is dying, as the effects of our abuse of the natural resources is taking out the crops of food we need to survive. Upon this dark scenario, former NASA engineer Cooper (McConaughey) is asked to pilot a spaceship with the purpose of crossing a wormhole that will lead to another galaxy. This, of course, in hopes of reaching three possible habitable planets explored by scientists sent there in previous missions. Given the unpredictable nature of an unknown environment such as a different galaxy, Cooper will have to decide whether he is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of humanity or if the urge to reunite with his daughter again is stronger. Personally I liked the story Nolan told us with this film, as it left you thinking about it after the movie was over, something Nolan does very well with his projects. Compared with his previous work, there are still movies that I love more than this. Still Interstellar is a brilliant film in it's own right and yet another great addition to this great director's Filmograhpy.In the end all I can say is, if you're a Sci-Fi fan, you surely must not miss this one. It will offer an unique visual experience and leave you wondering what the hell you just watched, even if you didn't feel completely satisfied.Rating: 8/10"
"Review of Interstellar : The first 80-90% of ""Interstellar"" I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn't make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It's sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?!As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful ""Gravity"", it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it's a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay."
"Review of Interstellar : Great movie. The beginning is interesting, as we learn that they are in some future year, and there is lack of food, etc. I liked that part, of introducing the viewer to the future Earth. The worst thing is that it may actually be accurate. The movie has beautiful pictures but the first half gets a little boring, nothing really happens. However, that changes in the second half, as the team travels through space. Things start happening and emotions start appearing, as well as suspense. There are good dialogues between the crew and those talks between astronauts and their families are really touching. However, in the last third of the movie, it really gets astonishing. The part of Matt Damon's planet is exciting and from there it goes all the way up. It reaches its climax when the rocket is drawn to the black hole and all the process gets explained. It is a mind twisting movie with a great final. Also, the soundtrack is really amazing, which is easy to explain: Hans Zimmer. Matthew Mcconaughey has a great performance and for me it's one of the movies of the year."
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar is one of those sci-fi that demands your attention throughout the film.If you are hoping for action like The dark Knight or Inception ,you would surely be disappointed. For me it is more like feeling the movie rather than just watching it.Matthew McCaughey nailed it this time. The only thing disappointing in this movie is the way they ended it.The plot has so many holes that you can't help but notice.Anne Hathaway's one dialogue ruin its ending.'Love is the one thing that transcends time and space'.Seriously? I mean if you want to take liberty in Black hole's quantum data scene you could have shown anything but scientific.Anyway, overall its a fantastic movie ,after all its a Nolan movie. So overall I have to say this is a must watch movie in fact one of the best movies of the decade."
"Review of Interstellar : One of the best movies u will be watching again and again, would take you on interstellar travel making you learn many new things and think deep.it creats an ambience u become deeply engrossed in."
"Review of Interstellar : Entertaining. Consistent. Space-travel at high stakes.It's hard-SF. Plays with the rules of physics.Good story, great acting, great music. The movie has it's own atmosphere, look and feel.A must-see. Anyway, it's now a classic of SF, that brought a lot to this genre."
"Review of Interstellar : I haven't seen the film since it came out in 2014. My teenage self found it slow, confusing, and tiresome. But, now I'm 2023, I decided to give it a rewatch solely because I constantly listen to the score. So, what did I think?I am pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the film. The film has so much heart for a SCFI movie that it took me off guard. At its core, it's about a Father wanting to reunite/protect his Child. The story was interesting, the ending might've been a bit too optimistic and rushed but it felt satisfying to me as a viewer.The cinematography, music, acting, sound design, set dressing, everything was amazing. Yes, there were points where I was thankful I had subtitles on. Seeing Topher Grace was also a bit odd since only associating him with That 70's Show and Venom. The visuals for the space scenes were astonishing. Truly a feat of CGI and Technological advances.Overall, there are more positives than negatives for the film. It was a great watch, the emotional beats landed for me, the betrayals were impactful, and it left me thinking more about this potential scenario."
"Review of Interstellar : First, the good stuff. Black hole and other imagery is top notch accurate, as confirmed last year by real life observations. This is by no means 2001: A Space Odyssey just as Nolan is no Kubrick, but the movie is ambitious and does have strong points. There are a lot of things that make no sense however, first, the nature of the Apocalypse on Earth is completely nonsensical, but on the other side, the oft criticized ending by the scientifically illi terate, makes much more sense than a lot of otherwise blindly accepted parts, especially if you take into account that once you go speculative, you cannot be that wrong. There is some sound strong sci-fi along the way, but a lot of nonsense points have to be given too, though many are saved by the (almost) brilliantly consistent ending, and a lot of sci-fi themes are nicely incorporated and shown, to stimulate imagination in some capable kids.There is also a strong extra point given for respect of the father, as single fatherhood is vastly underappreciated in the wok esick culture of nowaday. The daughter ""scientist"" is celebrated despite of the fact that she entirely plagiarizes work of future generations transmitted by her daddy, which is taken as her modest denial in a culture desperate but unable to obtain wok ef reindly heroines of disciplines for which for many centuries including decades of ins ane positive dis krimination they are proven to be a bit too soft in the head for, a touche, if subtle punch that irritated the ""critics"". Extra point for Matt Damon playing a nas ty man he always seemed to me to be.Overall, a flawed but inspiring piece that can stimulate imagination and scientific curiosity in those who have it, and some emotional roller coaster for the dimw it majority."
"Review of Interstellar : With Earth running out of resources, astronauts make a last-ditch attempt at locating other habitable planets within reach. This is possible via a wormhole, of unknown origin. And it *has* to work.At its core, this is about the love between a father, Coop(McConaughey, an everyday man with vital experience and a good team leader), and his daughter, Murph(Chastain, independent and as stubborn as he is). This is simultaneously its greatest strength and weakness. Everything we are excited about rides, to some extent, on us, and them, caring about both of them, and what they share. Thus, we never stop caring, and it enhances all the thrilling space adventures(almost exclusively grounded in reality, and the best theories), where the mastery of movement(or relative stillness) of the camera and the volume of the soundtrack(and sometimes deafening silence) builds tension to its breaking point, and, crucially, never beyond it. And unfortunately, this emotional grounding does eventually lead to some sappy sentimentalism.The ending will divide audiences. This owes a great, and openly acknowledged, debt to Kubrick's 2001, but it isn't a mere tribute to that, and to exploration of the stars and what that can bring, the latter of which it seeks to encourage a return to. It goes different places, and the third act will be long debated, as it deserves. The humor is well-integrated, not distracting and it eases us out of what would otherwise be relentless and unbearable heaviness. All of the effects are amazing, and the technology compelling. Watch this in the theater, it is made very much for that, as far as the visual and audible experience. The 2 hour and 45 minute running time, and that's not counting the closing credits, will scare some off, and it is perhaps too long.There is some disturbing content and a little moderate language in this. I recommend it to everyone who doesn't outright hate Nolan it is very much one of his films, for better as well as worse, however, even with the hokey aspects, this is one you shouldn't miss. 8/10"
"Review of Interstellar : Look this is still a good film and my rating system has no actual weight here. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant film maker but lately you start noticing that he is not without his shortcomings.His films are laden with the same tropes especially the massive plot holes. And that was the reason I wanted to see this film, to see what plot hole he had this time and yes they are a plenty.I will still give credit to where it's due. He really wanted to make a head scratcher and this time with the laws of general relativity which the film does closely follow. Basically the emotional device here is that Matthew Mahogany traveling at a fraction of the speed of light through space makes him age slower than his kids and basically its a race against time.However the Nolan-isms come full circle with not-so-subtle foreshadowing, overly pretentious unnatural dialogue, heavy-handed symbolism, a really ear-ringing Hans Zimmer score which make the Inception horns sound like and an unnecessarily long run time.I can see that this is a script he didn't really have time to think through but you can see he tried and its still pretty entertaining. However it's no 2001 A Space Odyssey. He should stick to thrillers. Sorry."
"Review of Interstellar : This is a good sci-fi tale, if you can manage to sit for almost 3 hours, about a mission to save the planet from some disaster (either global warming, dust bowls, or whoever wins the next presidential election). Matthew McConaughey heads the mission, along with Anne Hathaway and a few others I hadn't seen before. They also have a neat robot named TARS. They fly off to find some previous scientists, who have entered a black hole and settled on several worlds possible for human habitation. Matt Damon plays one of the scientists.You have to like black holes, relativity, and the fifth dimension (not the pop group) to appreciate this. I didn't know a thing about this film beforehand, so it was a nice surprise to see Michael Caine pop up. And when William Devane showed up, I instinctively blurted out ""What's in your safe?""The special effects are fine, but the characters are more interesting, and you do want to see how the situations get resolved. McConaughey is good, but he mumbles on occasion, which drives me nuts. I liked the music score, but at times it drowned out the actors."
"Review of Interstellar : I really liked the idea and the plot full of unexpected points and developments. Especially the second half of the movie is really intense of emotions and the final is simply great. I don't give 9 stars because in my opinion the dialogues are not brilliant, like in other Nolan's movies."
"Review of Interstellar : The meaning of ""They"" was pointed very creatively in the movie.
Also very smartly, highlighted the reality of human tendency.
Some times i feel, nasa encourage producers and directors to Produce such films on purpose.
To let the people gather some strength, to digest the upcoming truth they have already achieved."
"Review of Interstellar : An epic science fiction movie. Not just epic due to its running time - about 2 3/4 hours - but also due to its physical scale and the boldness of its concepts. Christopher Nolan has shaped a movie that tackles some fairly complex astrophysical issues, and carried it off with aplomb.Fantastic special effects, a clever plot and decent performances by an all-star cast.Not perfect though. The sci fi parts are great but the relationship / human drama stuff seems clumsy at times. The scene setting at the beginning seems to take forever. We all know the really good stuff - the space scenes - are coming at some stage but Nolan draws out the more mundane earth stuff. Plus, there are scenes and plot detours which feel unnecessary, and periods where the movie seems to drift. The Matt Damon sub-plot just felt like padding. Some of the seemingly unnecessary, overly contrived or implausible things do ultimately have a purpose. The conclusion ties up many loose ends and/or justifies some of the flat moments, but not all."
"Review of Interstellar : ""Interstellar"" is truly an epic, not in the sense of what we initially think of as an epic, for example ""Ben Hur"" or perhaps even ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (a film which it is worth pointing out I haven't seen), but more in the sense of how when I think back to ""Interstellar"", I think of those visually captivating shots of black, of the unknown and of those desolate landscapes made of water and ice, and how I found myself in awe of them. It is these that come to define ""Interstellar"". Set in the near future, Earth cannot sustain humanity anymore, and it's worth praising Nolan's subtle view of it, be it seeing the New York Yankees playing on an amateur field or discovering that the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union, which Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) denies. This scene, whilst allowing for a sense of character development in regards to Cooper, in retrospect seems to be Nolan emphasising how he sticks to the traditional elements of film and he does so more than ever in this film, from building several rooms of a spaceship from scratch to using five industrial fans to create a dust storm, thus attributing even more of the credit for the film to him. Yet as I expected, it proves very difficult for members of this all- star cast to break through both the visually stunning shots and the label of Christopher Nolan, and be noticed. Only McConaughey succeeds in doing so, although Mackenzie Foy (playing a young Murphy) and Bill Irwin (voicing the robot, TARS) deserve mentions, as does to an extent Michael Caine (playing Professor Brand) and his recital of Dylan Thomas' ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"", although I still don't entirely understand its inclusion, leaving big names such as Casey Affleck (playing Tom) and even Jessica Chastain (playing Murphy) ""down in the dirt"". Interstellar is a quintessentially Nolan film, meant to be seen on IMAX, imposing those classic Nolan themes of love and family whilst asking questions that I have not seen asked before, in this case winding up the scientists, although it is interesting to note that Nolan answers them by playing with several theories, instead of just getting the science completely wrong, as is so common. Yet the film is so Nolan that it takes that extra unnecessary step that Nolan always has present in his work, be it taking the audience to Limbo in Inception or by adding the twist of Miranda Tate (played by Marion Cotillard) turning out to be Talia al Ghul in The Dark Knight Rises. Before I conclude, I think it is important to make this point in regards to Nolan and his (future) works. He has begun, whether he means it or not, to dwarf his own cast and to an extent his own themes and his commitment to traditional film elements. The amount of hype that goes into his films is widespread and if he isn't careful, his future works could take a turn for the worse. As I have already said, Nolan always takes that extra unnecessary step, one that I don't think I would be so sympathetic with if it was another director, yet the brilliance of what comes before it makes up for it, often leaving me in that No Man's Land of whether the film was worth 9 or 10 stars."
"Review of Interstellar : I saw this movie in an IMAX theater and I have to say, although it has amazing visuals and suspenseful music, I was disappointed. The story was engaging, I cared about the characters but it didn't touch me and it didn't amaze me.The visuals: Everything about them was breathtaking. The use of models and little CGI really impressed me and the camera angles were close to perfect. It seemed like everything was planned and planned again, kinda reminded me of a Kubrick style movie (somewhat like 2001) but more dynamic. All the space stuff was amazing and completely silent which added to the movie as a whole.The music: Now, I have a few problems with it. I didn't really like it because it seemed to repetitive. Usually, the soundtracks made by Hans Zimmer always impress me but this time the music felt too repetitive. Is was all like someone was beating a drum in my ear over and over again. Though it did add to the movie, I just didn't really care for it.The plot: Now, I'm gonna go into a bit of a spoiler zone, so if you haven't seen the movie I suggest you stop reading right about here. So, I usually have a rule that I tend to get mad when it gets broken and this rule is that when you make a sci fi movie you either go for the ""realistic"" future, in which the laws of physics and technology and everything about it is plausible, to some extent (like Gattaca, Moon etc.), or you make a future that is set in another world that has its own rules (like Star Wars, Star Trek etc.). You never mix the two, and if you do it's very hard to make it work. Interstellar doesn't really make it work really well. It starts of as a hard sci fi and near the end it turns into complete fantasy. From the moment Cooper enters the black hole the movie is ruined for me because the movie sets out to be believable and right at that moment becomes too much. I couldn't get over it. If it happened in another movie, or if the movie started out as the type of movie that throws this kind of ""fantasy"" things in your face I would've been okay with it, but when the whole point of the movie is to make it seem so real and possible and every little thing has science behind and that it and could happen in real life, when it tries so hard to make you think about it as a real world and tries to make you think about every detail in it the whole ending of the movie makes 0 sense. The ending really dropped the ball in my opinion.Overall, a great movie, stunning visuals, great, if a bit repetitive, music and a good story until the end. 8/10"
"Review of Interstellar : Christopher Nolan's comprehensive Weltanschauung ( conception of universe and human's analogy to it ) Interstellar is his most endearing, audacious and expertly scripted venture. A script which once was developed by Jonathan Nolan for Steven Spielberg finally ended in the helms of his brother Chris. A sheer ocular pleasure, when viewed on 75 mm screen, this movie based intergalactic space voyage smells of ambition, emotion and beauty. The viewer doesn't needs to suspend his incredulity inspite of the film being a piece of fiction, owing to the fact that it is one of Nolan's strongest narrative.An enthralling and distinct start to movie reminding us of social documentaries which pictures blight-induced earth as a dust bowl with last shades of humanity left, earth has become inhabitable over time with increasing crop failure and frequent dust storms. Amidst the scenario comes Cooper (McConaughey), a widowed engineer-turned- pilot-turned-farmer who is prompted by some ghostly forces ( who send coded messages) to visit NASA facility in the outskirts of his village. The facility led by Dr John Brand (Micheal Caine) reveals Cooper about a secret mission in search of a habitable planet beyond the solar system and he asks Cooper to pilot the space ark 'Endurance' with the team. Devastated at the thought of her father leaving her, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) is filled with discontent and hatred for him.The film tracks Cooper's odyssey along with the NASA team and two robots CASE and TARS as they travel through the wormholes to discover a sustainable living environment while Dr Brand and grown- up Murph (Jessica Chastain) try and solve the inevitable problem of gravity. The direction is accurate and film balances well between different time zones as Cooper and his accomplices verge many light years ahead.Unavoidable comparisons with Gravity and 2001: a Space Odyssey, Interstellar thinks more about the future than focusing all its attention on the present and past. A graphically rich special effects packaged with a mammoth script which reflects a large time devoted to research and a great casting, Interstellar might be specious and flawed at places but it doesn't stop the movie from being a winner.8 on 10 stars"
"Review of Interstellar : Well, it was indeed a great movie. The plot twist was exactly as expected and very similar to Inception :)Mathew is acting alright and that girl; Jessica Chastain; she's hella fine - oh yeah, her acting's good too :PThere's not much more to say about this movie; great special effects. The physics of the movie is a little intricate. If you know the least bit about relativity you're gonna have a good time. I'm pretty sure there's some pretty big holes and flaws in the movies theories of relativity.I enjoyed this movie, a lot. You will too!"
"Review of Interstellar : I guess the key to truly enjoy Interstellar is to think of it not as a sci fi movie but as a fantasy movie set in space. The cinematography is truly stunning, flawless. It breaks from some of the conventional shots and ideas you would expect on the space scenes and it does that with superb results. But it seems that the plot is not at the same level.Don't get fooled by the talk about wormholes and relativity, the science behind it is closer to a Doctor Who script than to 2001. Not that I have anything against Doctor Who, I love it, but they don't try to pass it as hard sci-fi. And sometimes it goes from bad science to downright impossible and cheesy, with some pages stolen from Space Cowboys or Armaggedon.And that is a shame, because this could have been one of the best movies ever, and the spiritual successor to 2001, but it does not have the courage to do so, opting for a more commercial and accessible script, with some memorable moments mixed with some dialogues I want to forget.It is a great movie and you should definitely see it, just avoid falling for those 10/10 reviews."
"Review of Interstellar : Tries to be smart and gets it 70% of the time but movie is all over the place. Couldn't hear dialogs half the time because music soundtrack was too loud.Another movie where the USA saves the world, but get this -- Not only does the daughter solve the whole world's problems by solving complex issues unsolvable by the world's smartest people, but her dad saves Earth. Give them a double Nobel peace prize! Somehow father and daughter communicate thru space time via (gravity). Yes folks, next time your feet tickles, it could be your great grandparents communicating via the 5th dimension by Morse code."
"Review of Interstellar : Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot and engineer, is now reluctantly scraping together a living as a farmer on a starving Earth. With sandstorms swirling and food supplies dwindling by the day, it doesn't seem likely that Cooper's children, stoic Tom and inquisitive Murphy, will have much of a world left to inherit when they grow up. While investigating a ""ghost"" in Murphy's bedroom, Cooper deciphers a message that brings him to a top-secret NASA base. Once there, Cooper learns from his former mentor, Dr Brand (Michael Caine), that NASA is looking for solutions to Earth's crisis in other galaxies. A recently-opened wormhole has given NASA and its scientists access to a whole new galaxy of planets. Brand appeals to Cooper to pilot the final and most important mission: to determine whether any of three identified planets can truly host human life. But it's a journey from which Cooper might never return - one that will take him away from his kids and everything he has ever known and loved.That's not even the half of it – Nolan's narrative is a sprawling, ambitious one that asks heavy metaphysical questions about the position and role of humanity in the universe, filtered through the prism of a father and daughter whose bond transcends time and space. It's shot through with complex scientific theories about wormholes and time travel courtesy of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who served as a consultant on the film). Indeed, much of Interstellar plays with such philosophical gravity that one can't help wondering if it's simply too deep a subject to be effectively communicated in a movie that must also create emotional stakes and real characters.Clocking in at almost three hours, Interstellar pulses with intelligence and occasional bursts of brilliance. The science and emotion of its story works best on each planet they manage to visit, with Nolan crafting some chillingly smart sci-fi moments amidst the human drama experienced by Cooper's crew. As badly as Cooper wants to save enough fuel to make the return trip home, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) has both professional and personal stakes in visiting the planet that's furthest away from the wormhole. They trade hope for time, the minutes they use to hunt for salvation translating into the loss of decades with their loved ones. The film is at its best when the members of the Endurance - including David Gyasi's Romilly and Wes Bentley's Doyle - confront one another, and establish contact (or fail to do so) with the scouting teams that preceded them through the wormhole.But Interstellar also suffers from a bloated and faintly silly final act. The science of it may be well-founded (who knows, after all, what miraculous answers really do lie within a black hole?) and the concept very cool, but it doesn't quite translate as such. Instead, the film hyper-blasts itself into a oddly cheerful (and confusing) ending that feels purely fictional and not at all scientific. There's no denying, either, that Nolan could have carved half an hour or more out of Interstellar without losing any of its narrative or emotional density. Instead, many scenes unfold in an almost obstinately languid fashion, including a moment when Cooper is left gasping for oxygen on the icy terrain of an alien planet. It's pretty evident, too, that Nolan really wanted to make sure his audiences knew how little greenscreen he used to make the film; for no other discernible reason, his camera lingers in extreme close-up - and far too often - on the exterior shells of the various spacecrafts designed for the film.Nolan can afford the best when it comes to his cast as well, and it shows. McConaughey anchors the film with a gravitas and tenderness quite unknown before his career McConnaissance, and he's ably supported by a steely Hathaway, whose character, just like the film she's in, blends cold, pragmatic science with a churning wealth of emotion. Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon, in roles perhaps best left unspecified to avoid any explicit spoilers, are excellent too - the former radiates quite enough warmth and intelligence to make us believe that she can save the world, and the latter admirably treads in morally grey areas to good effect.For months before its release, Nolan kept Interstellar firmly under wraps. Everyone speculated that it would be a game-changer - a sci- fi blockbuster as thrilling and thought-provoking as it is entertaining. In some ways, that's true of the final product: Nolan's film is brave, brainy film-making, and it looks absolutely spectacular. But, on closer examination, Interstellar loses some of its gloss and varnish - and beneath it all lies an unwieldy script that meanders a little too long and wastes a little too much of the big, breathtaking ideas that underpin its story."
"Review of Interstellar : Not Nolan's greatest work, Interstellar is a slow burn mind bender but it keeps you in the game until the end, and features stunning visuals and a great cast. Recommend to Nolan fans."
"Review of Interstellar : Pro's:
Actually no sound in space finally, very well done.Atmosphere of the desolate and loneliness have been captured perfectly.Big fan of the soundtracks
Overall good acting, only the protagonist didn't fit too well for me
Nice idea and story.Con's:
Predictability. The ghost and the meeting at the end with a very old murphy were both pretty obvious to come 2/3 into the movie.Also how the heck did the dad get out of the black hole."
"Review of Interstellar : Even though I'm a big fan of Christofer Nolan, I find this movie pretty boring. Respect for tackling such a complex subject and for making generally smart blockbusters. Unfortunately, movie is a big mess. Wrong pace, melodramatic acting, terrible music and mumbling i'm-a-badass-cowboy Matthew McConaughey speech just didn't work for me. One of the most miscast movies I have ever seen. I'm familiar with Solaris and 2001 Odyssey, but this one just didn't work for me. I gave it 7 after all, since I don't think movie is terrible, I just think it's not great, and people got brainwashed by marketing tools into loving this film and giving it such high grade."
"Review of Interstellar : Nice effects but the storyline although very much hyped for its scientific accuracy is absolutely nonsense. Wormholes do not exist for a start. The view of the black hole might be somehow accurate but the idea that you could somehow get close to the accretion disk and survive is hilarious. The end of the movie is rather pathetic and free of any realistic aspect's. Maybe someone without any scientific background believes in the pseudo science of this movie but advertising this movie for realism is a very long shot. I was reading many reviews and had high expectations, but left the cinema rather disappointed. The movie is full of inaccuracies and I rather watch a fantasy movie like StarWars or StarTreck but not this pseudo scientific nonsense story."
"Review of Interstellar : Was this movie terrible? No, but for as much praise as it got, I'm astounded. The plot was ridiculous and unbelievable. That isn't what killed the movie however, it was the acting! Maybe the director wanted the actors to act that way, but every time they did something amazing, they barely acted surprised. It was as if it was all in a days work. This is the sole reason why I can't get myself to re- watch this movie. The visuals were amazing, but I'm more interested in plot lines and character development than pretty effects (call me old school, even though I'm in my 20's). The movie tries to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but falls short. 2 months after watching Interstellar, not much is retained in my memory (I had to re-read the ridiculous plot and re-watch a trailer to bring my memory back). Whereas 2001 I watched 6 or so months ago and remember most of it. It may seem like I'm calling this movie terrible, it's not. It's just highly overrated and I need to point out the flaws that keep this from being a masterpiece. Maybe I've seen too many programs about space (Cosmos, The Universe, 2001, etc) that keep this movie from stunning me with the visuals, but if you're a person that has not seen too many space programs, you'd probably like it. And just an FYI, this is coming from a guy that hated Gravity and Inception. If you like those, you may like this movie."
"Review of Interstellar : ""Interstellar"" pretends to be more intelligent than Alfonso Cuarón's audio-visual roller coaster, ""Gravity"", but ironically its best moments are those which, like Gravity, rely purely on thrill and spectacle.For the rest of the film we are crammed into a tiny shuttle with McConaughey and his crew, or back on earth with the desperate remnants of human civilization as they attempt to solve the problem of starvation. Most of the dialogue consists of reams and reams of contrived quantum-physics babble, which, if you're like me, will whoosh straight over your head like those exposition sequences in CSI, with brief moments of levity provided by the two -weirdly cubic looking- robots TARS and CASE.Their journey to find another habitable planet is marred by a sequence of seemingly insurmountable problems that become progressively so ludicrous, it ends up impossible to take them seriously, albeit exciting to watch.We already have to stretch our disbelief past the opening premise that the world is dying because of crop blight, yet they've managed to build robots that have human intelligence and can adapt a variety of shapes to achieve a wide range of tasks. One wonders why humans at this level of technological advancement couldn't have found a solution to curbing this unexplained blight other than blasting off into a foreign galaxy to try and populate a mysterious planet neighboring a black hole.Glaring plot issues aside (and there are many), the film is at its best when in full space simulator mode and the audience is being catapulted into the roaring white light of a black hole, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's electrifying score (props to Zimmer for once NOT composing something that sounded exactly like Pirates of The Caribbean), making full use of the IMAX experience.Performances are fairly solid, in particular Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph, and there is enough raw emotion on show to push some of the more logically questionable moments past your cynic meter and give a sense of weight and importance to what is happening, even if you can't quite understand it.Definitely worth watching on the big screen, but would I give it a 9/10? No way. This is a film that you will enjoy on face value, but once you leave the cinema you will start picking it to shreds. There are just too many inconsistencies, contrivances and blatant stupidity in the plot to call this a masterpiece, but I'd give it a solid 7 for blockbuster entertainment value."
"Review of Interstellar : Just watched this in New Zealand. The IMDb rating is still above 9 at the time. Not sure it will stay there though. It's not a bad movie but it's not a great one either (which a 9 should be). It's creative in terms of story but it is drawn out. It goes for the Gravity look and feel, being slow, filmed in space and with dialog often replaced with music, but it does not have the suspense of Gravity. It's doesn't draw you in. It just doesn't have enough substance to carry it off. It has plenty of promise but lets you down in the end, especially once you pull all the pieces together to formulate what's going on. It's still worth watching, at 7/10, just don't expect a 9/10."
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar marks a critical moment in the career of Christopher Nolan; he has come a long way from being the indie noir director of Memento and Insomnia, to striking gold in the enormously popular Dark Knight franchise. Inception was proof Nolan could successfully tackle a big- budget, original idea outside of the Batman series, but with comic book films behind him, Interstellar has to sell on the promise that Nolan is not a one-hit wonder of big-budget original ideas.The movie's plot focuses on Cooper, a Southerner and family man who doesn't quite understand why man is turning away from flight. ""We used to look up at the stars and wonder about our place in the stars,"" he says, ""now we just look at the ground and see dirt."" Matthew McCoughaney shines in the role of Cooper, delivering one of his career-best. Cooper is an everyman, and nothing in this world (or any other) is more important to him than his kids; in particular, his daughter Murphy, played spectacularly by Mackenzie Foy.Despite great performances from a huge ensemble, beautiful visuals and setting, shot by first- time Nolan cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (Let The Right One In), Interstellar features a typical problem in every Nolan movie: too much expository dialogue. It is very obvious in numerous moments that Nolan is trying to feed us information and backstory. My other issue with the opening of the film is pacing. Thought the movie establishes the world and doesn't rush to do so, the movie rushes off into space the moment the idea of interstellar travel is introduced. From the first act, it is unclear whether Interstellar can deliver. It's in the second act where the movie really begins to blossom. Much of the film from this point on is set in space, and boasts mind-bending special effects as timeless as 2001: A Space Odyssey. The movie features some strikingly similar shots, clearly paying homage to the classic space opera. A lot of the shots are wonderful, and Interstellar features the best cinematography in any of his films (sorry Wally Pfister), but a few times, I found myself wondering the purpose of some of these shots of the ship ""Endurance"". Interstellar reaches for the stars, but in act two still seems unsure of where it may land.In addition to great visuals, the sound design and score are top-notch. Hans Zimmer does some of his best work, bringing in a score that is both celestial and organic; it perfectly balances tones we normally associate with outer space, while hitting all the right emotional notes. And the movie knows when to be quiet in space; not just outside the ship, but inside. I loved the moments where things were so silent you could hear the background whirring of computers, the slight creaking of the ship, the breath of the characters. The attention to detail in both sight and sound made the movie feel real.When the plot does finally introduce a ""villain"" in it's second act, the movie starts to feel it may have overstayed it's welcome. Interstellar runs at 169 minutes, and it's a long one admittedly. Cooper and Amelia, played by a well-cast Anne Hathaway, are finally forced into unforeseeable circumstances, and Christopher Nolan does not hold back. This makes for some heartstring- tugging sequences, and Interstellar may have benefited from stepping on the brakes with some of the emotionally heavy content, but the acting is so good, that it doesn't matter if it's slightly overdone, and it all builds it to a marvelous climax.Interstellar's third act is as stunning as anything I've ever seen in film. For critics who thought Inception was proof that Christopher Nolan was not very imaginative visually with free reign, Interstellar proves them wrong. Thematically and scientifically, the movie dares to challenge, it dares its audience to follow into the unknown, beyond the horizon. I am still trying to wrap my head around it all.Nolan's blockbuster epic is not perfect, and it's not for the common audience. If you're looking for big action sequences, or looking to turn your brain off for awhile, you're in the wrong movie. It's got some bumps along the way, but Interstellar is visionary for our time, and so bold in its execution, that it is not bogged down by its few flaws. I was thrilled to take the ride. Interstellar is thought-provoking, emotional, cinematic, and a wonder to behold, which in time, should earn its title in the league of great science fiction.Grade: A+"
"Review of Interstellar : As directed by Christopher Nolan, he of the pretentious, derivative, mind-bending crap-fest that was Inception and the vastly over-rated Dark Knight trilogy, I fully expected Interstellar to have plot holes you could pilot a space station through—and, with a whopping running time of 169 minutes, I figured staying awake would be a task almost as gargantuan as the film's black hole (which is actually called Gargantua—that's just how gargantuan it is!!!).Sure enough, the preposterous pseudo-scientific plot can be picked apart with ease, but the film itself is something of an anomaly: although it is a grossly indulgent pile of pretentious hooey that stretches plausibility to breaking point, I found myself entertained throughout. Interstellar is so far up itself that it actually transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable piece of big-budget baloney as a result.For starters, we get Matthew McConaughey's farmer Cooper, who is chosen to pilot NASA's only spacecraft, despite having spent the last decade or so growing corn. Then we get two of science-fiction's most aesthetically awkward robots in the form of A.I. units TARS and CASE. After flying through a worm-hole, Cooper lands his spacecraft in several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. We see a planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. We have a mad scientist who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting Cooper with his space helmet. Although Michael Caine's character spans 23 years, he doesn't look a day older than when we first see him (his voice just gets a bit hoarse, but not Batman hoarse). And Cooper enters a black hole where he ends up behind a 5-dimensional bookcase that allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via wristwatch!!!And that's just the stuff I can recall right now (it's waaay past my bed-time and I'm very tired).If only there had been a few ninjas, some gratuitous female nudity (perhaps a race of insatiable, sexy alien maidens with over-sized breasts), a planet of space zombies, and a laser battle, this would have been the perfect so-bad-it's-good movie.7/10: it's too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as I really should."
"Review of Interstellar : It might sound arrogant, what i wrote in the summary field, but unfortunately this film misses many aspects of common sense. Given it was a Nolan film I did expect more than this but I think he may be slipping somewhat (the bat bike in Dark Knight Rises flipping over with its magical 360 deg wheel comes to mind).Im not going to get into a full review about what this film is about but I will say that if you are dealing with time paradoxes, make sure you know how to address them and not say 'ah what the hell, the audience won't know...'The film has a wormhole. One that is placed aaaaalllllll the way out near Saturn by someone we don't know (but lead to believe its evolved humans). I say, why not have the wormhole next to Earth? who knows. Did evolved humans make the wormhole? if so, how did they get off Earth to evolve and put it there?To watch the film is nice, the space scenes are stunning and film stock nice. But, no 2001 competitor this time round."
"Review of Interstellar : 9.1 at IMDb? Seriously?? 4 of my 5 stars are for the visual effects. 1 star is for McConaugh and Hathaway. The Nolan brothers, however, get zilch for their bullshit cosmology mixed with banal sentimentality and quasi-philosophy. It is a mystery to me, why some filmmakers love to mix so much ""science"" into their movies, when most of it is so horrendously unrealistic, misleading, incomprehensible and incorrect. Kubrick avoided most of the science talk, and created an artistic expression of the space-and-time mystery. That's why ""2001"" will remain a masterpiece and why ""Interstellar"" will be soon forgotten. And the movie is also painfully slow, 168 mins, most of which are spent on closeups of McConaugh and Hathaway, with or without space helmet as well as worn and rusty space equipment, as if that would make it look more real..."
"Review of Interstellar : In short; whatever your thoughts and feelings about Christopher Nolan's Inception will likely be the same for Interstellar. It relied on big ideas, very impressive CGI. A cast full of the best actors. A bit awkward in places and the plot had to be forced out of characters. Really, it was pleasant to watch a well made film. The story begins as the world is ending, blight is taking over the world's crops. Those that don't starve will later suffocate, as the film describes. The biggest selling point for me was the science behind the movie. Kip Thorne wrote the treatment to this film.He previously worked with Carl Sagan on Contact and is the Feynman professor of theoretical physicist at Caltech. If those names don't mean anything to you then know that that means the films is going to be featuring a lot of talk about General Relativity. Time dilation is going to be involved and as far as I am aware it hasn't been done very well in films before. It still hasn't, but it makes the awkward and forced plot fun to watch plot. I was sceptical about Matthew McConnaughey, he usually annoys me. He is accepting his maturity and has become a decent actor. I was very impressed with his work. The rest of the cast is full of talent but the weak script gave them no room for development, as is typical n a Nolan film. A few times they did get to go on a rant, they try to go deep and heavy, the meaning of love, survival, what time means. This never worked in he film. They are only human, maybe their musings were meant to be imperfect. When SCi-fi is at its best is when it debates these issues (hopefully in space). We only saw one side to each of them, a little monologue to stop the conversation and dramatically move on to the next scene. The CGI was beautiful, but all CGI reliant films end up looking out of date after a few years. The acting was perfect, but the script was weak. The science was exciting, but it was over exaggerated and had those awkward moments where one supposed expert has to oversimplify a concept while explaining to another supposed expert so the audience can understand what is going on. Best of all, there were no sounds in space!"
"Review of Interstellar : There's a lot to like in this film. The way it uses real and theoretical science, the way it doesn't pander to the Star Wars fans by showing space as it is, a soundless void. There's a great deal of thought surrounding communication across time. Ultimately though the film is flawed in many ways. Let me list them: 1/ The idea that food crops are failing across the world and yet people are shown still eating wholesome meals...there is still gas for the cars and power stations still work is somewhat incongruous to me.2/ Matthew McConaughey is just not the right person to have played the lead role. He seems too laconic and the way he mumbled his dialogue at times was downright annoying.3/ I don't think the US would allow school books to be printed saying that the moon landings were a hoax designed to bankrupt Russia. Political correctness, I suppose, will probably become more intrusive in the future...but THAT intrusive? 4/ The ""incident"" with Matt Damon (""Dr. Mann"") is just ridiculous and muddies the storyline and the pace of the film.5/ The robot design is so impractical as to be laughable. Even the B9 robot from the old TV show ""Lost in Space"" would have worked better.6/ Will Hollywood PLEASE pension off Mr. Zimmer and his theme-less exercises in going up and down the music scales to generate tension. Much of the ""music"" was loud and not appropriate to scene and there really was no memorable theme at all. Goldsmith would be turning in his grave! I congratulate the Nolans for trying to make an intelligent SciFi film in these times of dross. They have succeeded in many ways but the film is not the masterpiece 2001 is."
Review of Interstellar : As of 11 June 2018. It is a max 7/10 on a good day
"Review of Interstellar : The epic feel of 'Interstellar' comes from its sheer length and scope of events, but the actual impact of the plot line was lacking, leaving me STILL unsure as to whether or not I even liked the movie. It feels like this is a film that the Nolan brothers wanted to make without creative input from the evil movie executives who usually demand edits based on pacing or story/character complexity. In short, it's a director's cut, through and through. Some scenes or plot points were light or jumbled that I stopped trying to figure out what was going on and just let the movie take me for a ride, in which I became more of a spectator than a moviegoer. The development of the movie itself felt a little like ADHD Netflix; first it's Shyamalan's Signs, then 2001: A Space Odyssey, suddenly Event Horizon (softened by the deadpan humor of Dr. Who-esque robots), ending with Luke Skywalker hopping in a small spacecraft with his trusty droid off to find Leia in the Degoba System or whatever. Though 'Interstellar' brings some new story mechanisms into play, like Einstein's relativity and what it would be like to exist outside of time, these devices have been explored thoroughly outside of film - unlike the 'dream within a dream' concept. At the end of the day, the spectacular feel of 'Interstellar' is handicapped by it's lack of solid delivery and plot disconnectivity. It's worth the price of a normal movie ticket, but don't be surprised if you leave the theater scratching your head."
"Review of Interstellar : When it comes to endings and general philosophy of storytelling, you can distinguish between two kinds of fiction.The first is soothing, consolatory: characters may face dangers but at the end order is restored. The second is more problematic and offers no easy resolution; by the time the story is over, events have taken a major toll on those involved - maybe they have lost what they wanted, or their achievement is implied to be short-lived. Maybe they wonder if it was even worth it at all.The first kind of fiction is Spielberg, the other Kubrick; the first is Nolan of Memento, the other Nolan of Interstellar.Now, both kinds have their place and there is nothing wrong with more lighthearted fare; in fact, most of the time I'd rather watch a crackling popcorn flick like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars than a fine but bleak film like, say, The Deer Hunter. The trouble is when you try to mix these two kinds: the result will have major tonal problems.See Interstellar: in a story about entropy and loss, the kind of conclusion this film dishes out just feels wrong after the somber 150 minutes preceding it. It's fluffy and tone-deaf.Pity, because I was enjoying the movie. Acting is effective, with a solid McConaughey and an unusual supporting role for Damon; special mention to young Mackenzie Foy, who is fine as the protagonist's daughter.At its best, Interstellar provides moment of awe (the oceanic planet), compelling dilemmas, tension and pathos (the scene with Cooper leaving in bad terms with his daughter is moving); exposition is clunky-but-interesting in an Inception kind of way. But the movie lost me with its last act.When Hathaway's character (an astronaut) states, unironically, that in our universe love is a force stronger than time and space and then she turns out to be right... well, I'm both religious and a big softie so I should be on board with that... it is, however, both too bluntly expressed and turns into an ending which feels similar to the maudlin Nolan provided in The Dark Knight Rises, only it's even more inappropriate here.6,5/10"
"Review of Interstellar : I give this movie an A+ for effort, hence the 7 out of 10, but it ultimately fails. First of all this movie borrows so heavily from other movies of greater worth its almost, again, almost ludicrous. Second if you go watch 2001 you'll actually find interstellar's visuals a disappointment compared to a movie made almost 40 years ago. Sure they show a more accurate view of a worm hole and a black hole, but its glimpsed or seen through a cockpit window or on a computer screen. This movie does not embrace the visual of space as it claims to. Do we see what one of the planets that they are visiting looks like from space? uh no. Gravity did so much better at its visuals than this movie does. As you've probably heard the main story line is basically not original and a bit melodramatic. I had no connection to it. I was more interested in the people who had gone ahead of them, but we only meet one and he's unexpected and a jerk. (But in reality how much? Wasn't Cooper (matt m) being just as selfish in some ways??) Loved the music but so did the Director with his heavy handed use of it."
"Review of Interstellar : ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS***Christopher Nolan - the man behind one of the greatest sci-fi movies IMO, Inception - wrote this movie.I really like this movie, and the 3 hours went very fast. However, the movie leaves me with some frustrations on some plot holes and unexplained things. On the big water planet our crew went to, it is explained, that the gravity is so powerful, that an hour on that planet is about 7 Earth-years. With so heavy a gravity, the crew should be crushed by the gravity. However, the planets gravity is only 1.4 of the Earths gravity. And furthermore, when the crew return to the base after 15 minutes, the remaining crew-member have waiting 26 years. And how can the main person enter a black hole(!) without being crushed or anything?If this nonsense not where present in the movie, it would easily get 9 or 10 stars from me."
"Review of Interstellar : I'm not going to review the movie, but I will review the flawed/easily manipulated Rating system this site has become. As I write this, the movie supposedly has over 12000 independent movie-going-public votes - even though the general release of the movie in the U.S. is not until tomorrow and the international release is occurring now. And, apparently, well over 11000 of those votes gave this movie a 10 out of 10 rating because the overall rating is 9.3 - that would mean that not only is Interstellar the best movie ever made in the history of cinema, but it is far and away the best movie ever made and movies such as The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, etc. are only average by comparison. There are two other possibilities. The first is these 12000 voters have seen only a few movies and they were so bad that this one seemed perfect by comparison. Or the entire voting process is manipulated by filmmakers to produce artificially high ratings to dupe potential ticket buyers. Spoiler Alert: It's not the best movie ever made."
"Review of Interstellar : Interstallar (2014)This is a Christopher Nolan movie. So when it does what he does best—shake you out of your seat with cinematic brilliance—it's terrific. I mean terrific. There are effects, like the black hole, or the various spacecraft maneuvers, and even a few wild dashes through cornfields, that work so well you don't need to think about why they are happening. You are immersed, and impressed, and wowed.But Nolan is more clever than deep it seems. A movie like ""Memento"" takes the slimmest of terrific ideas (a reordering of time in the brain) and make it amazing to watch. Movies like his Batman trilogy avoid even cleverness and work with pure energy and mythology. But in all of these there is no sense of what you would call ""meaning."" They are entertainments. ""Interstellar"" is purely horrible science—it's the butt of endless jokes on the web. But behind all the liberties and mistakes there, the movie is trying to say something ""deep"" about being human in an inhuman universe. About the special qualities humans have to be innovative, to procreate, and most of all to love. This is a bowing down to the power of love. Love conquers all, that kind of thing.Maybe it's the brother, Jonathan Nolan, who is responsible here as the co-writer. The grandiose ideas the two of them present in ""Batman Rises"" are wonderfully impossible and almost laughable if you take them out of context. (In context they're part of the whole great success of the movie.) But ""Interstallar"" takes itself seriously. Way too seriously for this kind of material and with no grip on the science, not even a hint of it. As a fantasy, it could have gone so much farther, as a piece of art based on reality, well, go see ""Gravity"" for an alternative that makes a better (imperfect) attempt to follow the rules of nature.There is of course the plot here, saving the world, saving the species, saving your family. You have to just go with the flow here, as well, since it's all a bit romanticized in a Spielberg/Cameron kind of plasticky gloss. It frankly made me sick—and yet it was so well filmed I liked it. That's the kicker—Nolan is terrific with the camera, and with the vision of making things vivid and big.See this movie for all of those best things. I saw it on a celluloid (non-digital) IMAX screen and in those portions of the movie shot in full 70mm large format, the effects were memorable. (The movie alternates between standard widescreen 35mm film and full, academy ratio 70mm, which is taller and has far more detail. The normal theater presentations approximate the effects, but in a more normal scale and resolution.) Obviously this movie has won a lot of people over. I'm not sure who they are, but it's reasonable to be blown away. Nolan has openly defended himself against all the complaints—as if everyone is wrong and we just don't get it. Fine. If you want a hilarious rundown of some of the many logical problems of the movie, see http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/11/08/interstellar-plot-holes/ or type interstallar plot holes entertainment weekly in google.But what until you see it first and just enjoy it on its own terms."
"Review of Interstellar : Great music. An extremely talented cast. Amazing special effects. Captivating issues to contemplate. So why do I think I will not ponder this film long after I have viewed it? The story is convoluted, though interesting. All the drama and mystery and intrigue leads to a finale that tells us what? Well, not really much. But it's a fun trip getting there.I liked many of the characters. And I was invested in their problems and tragedies. But the final ""explanation"" of the film's phenomena has a ""Sixth Sense"" feeling to it. I say see this film for its good points, but don't expect the groundbreaking impact of Kubrick's ""2001"" or the atmospherics of ""Blade Runner"" or the thrilling ride of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""."
"Review of Interstellar : I could not wait to find a cinema that showed this movie, especially after two of my close friends went as far as to saying that it was beyond a doubt one of the best movies of all time. Honestly, I don't think it's the case. It will be one of the top movies of the year but that's about it. Christopher Nolan seems to feel the need to explain to us every single thing that happens, every step of the way so we don't get lost. It becomes a little annoying as the movie progresses. Another thing that makes this movie lose a couple of points is that hippie conversation around the half way point, where Anne Hathaway says something along the lines of ""nothing is more powerful than love"". Please! Get serious! On the positive side, the last few minutes of the movie are quite spectacular visually. Probably better than Gravity. All in all, considering the type of movies that get done these days, Interstellar is definitely one to watch."
"Review of Interstellar : Christopher Nolen rides again with this massive scale sci-if journey story that braids cutting edge special effects, amazing performances and a supremely inventive story together to make what is sure to be one of the year's landmark films. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a NASA astronaut forced to become a farmer in a world where earth's natural resources have dwindled down to nearly nil. As Cooper struggles to raise his children during what seems to be humanity's final throws, a team of scientists, headed by Nolen favorites Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway and David Gyasi, put together a daring plan to save humanity by searching for new inhabitable world's beyond our galaxy and require Cooper's skill to get them there.I really dug the hell out of this movie. As a fan of space travel myself, I really have to say that they did a great job at capturing a lot of the real math and science theory behind space travel, relativity theory and even some of the more edgy ideas about the characteristics of black holes. It's clear that the Nolen brothers Christopher and Jonathen did their homework while writing this script. The performances are also quite good here and Jessica Chastaine, who plays Cooper's grownup daughter, is especially impressive. These things married with the IMAX scope and the bigger than life special effects make this movie an absolute joy to watch. Everything is not all aces here as the film is not without its faults. Perhaps the thing I had the most problem with was the film's third act. The movie spends a long time setting up a very real and for the most part, a scientifically sound universe that is on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey and even to some degree it makes fun of a tropish, nonsensical and dumb way that the story could end as if to say, ""we're smarter than that, c'mon, what do you take us for?"" only to give in and end it that way anyway. At first I was OK with it but the more that I look at the film, the less the ending makes sense and the more the film starts to eat itself which was needless to say, really disappointing.Overall, I still liked the movie and despite my issues with the third act, I recommend it, and if you can, spring for the IMAX because the scope and scale of the visuals are ridiculous! No television could ever do it justice. This film is for sure to be in talks to win an award of some kind for special effects in the coming months and it's well deserved. If you love liked Gravity or 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13, you are sure to like this too. Interstellar gets a 3.5...out of 5."
Review of Interstellar : The vast amount of space is always been intriguing and waiting to be discovered. This movie dives deep into these ideas and gives a complex and adventurous route through time and space. Open your mind sit back and enjoy a good movie.
"Review of Interstellar : I will keep this short for the sake of not spoiling anything.Right off i should say I love Nolan. I adore most of his movies, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with 'Interstellar.' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen. Ultimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work. By the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in ""Interstellar"" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work."
"Review of Interstellar : You would think the story is adventurous, exciting, beautiful! Its not at all what I had hoped. It is slow, dark as a black hole, loud as an old Barton Theater Organ playing Fugue in D Minor interesting as a litter box. The story is thin.....I can't blame the actors, the entire plot is pretty simple. Can't inhabit earth, find somewhere else to live. Interstellar is a repeat of time continuum stories you have heard or seen before, I wont spoil it, but it's all been told before. Dialog is dreary, slow, ponderous. The comparison to 2001 is preposterous. The wonder and awe of 2001 and other movies before it was it had never been done it was the first. 2001 was all done without the advanced technology we have in computer imagery we have today. 2001 was a pioneering effort. This is not at all pioneering, inventive or surprising if you read science fiction at all. The imagery is not all that unique or impressive. The constant thumping and droning of background music was mind numbing. Most of the show I was trying to nod off, but for the LOUD THEATER ORGAN playing in the background I probably would have. I have to agree with some of the reviewers who thought the whole show was ridiculous and in some ways they are right. Somehow science has advanced enough to create interstellar space travel but not far enough to build power cells, clean power, they are still burning fossil fuels. The robots are Lego like, silly looking clunks of stainless steel....it is all so ridiculous. I would not call this HORRIBLE or AWFUL I have seen some real stinkers over the years. Interstellar is not so ridiculous it is a parody of a good movie it is just not a great movie some had hoped it to be."
"Review of Interstellar : This is a movie with plenty of things going for it. Great performances, incredible visual effects, an interesting story, and tons of really cool concepts, which make for a few genuinely powerful scenes, However, that doesn't make it the flawless masterpiece of cinematic genius everybody is labeling it as. There are tons of people giving this movie 10/10 ratings, leading to a user rating of 8.7, and it is now #29 on the IMDb top 250. WOW! That is a lot of praise! On the top 250, ""Interstellar"" is above ""Casablanca"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Psycho"", ""Apocalypse Now"", and ""CITIZEN KANE""! According to the users on IMDb, this movie's better than ""Citizen Kane"", which has been known as possibly the greatest film of all time!Is is better than ""Citizen Kane""? No, not even close. The film is full of flaws, the biggest being the runtime. I may never see this movie again because of how long it felt! It feels like a lot of scenes are unneeded, and were made just so the movie could be longer, because Christopher Nolan wanted to make it seem really epic. I'm sure if Nolan cut a huge chunk of the movie out, it would've been better. A film by Nolan that is better than this one is ""The Dark Knight"", which has a somewhat long runtime, but it feels way shorter than it's runtime, and is extremely entertaining throughout. ""Interstellar"" is so long that it starts to really drag on and, at times, I began to just zone out.The film is also a bit too dramatic. The dialogue about how ""love conquers all"" seemed very unnecessarily corny, as well as a few other select scenes in the movie. However, some sequences were quite powerful, especially the ending, which, actually, was kind of creepy. The concept of time was very prominent throughout the film, and it lead to some pretty creative and powerful sequences.Overall, the film is recommended, but you should be warned that this movie was LOOOOOOOONG!!!!!!"
"Review of Interstellar : I am sorry but found this movie to be highly over rated. It was high on visual effects but low on the content in terms of script, story and the future of the world basically.I am sure it will grab few awards in these categories.There was a similar hype around Avatar but when I saw Avatar, it had something new to offer. Interstellar doesn't offer anything new as such.If you put the movie Gravity and the movie Frequency together in 5D, wormhole angle, you have Intersetllar.In fact I found Frequency to be highly underrated movie.Acting/Direction is good but wished the script were much more stronger."
"Review of Interstellar : This movie requires blind faith in theoretical physics as much as religion requires blind faith.And I'm not talking mainstream blind faith - I'm talking Mormon/Scientology levels of blind faith.The best one can do is just watch it as a film, and not get caught up in the science, or lack there of.As a film, they spend WAY too much time with the family in the beginning. Time that should have been dedicated to the actual space travel.A very slow burn, but the acting is great.A serious lack of explanation for things they want you to swallow for the story to make sense.I give it a one time watch value of 7; with a rewatch value of 4.Together - a 6.Decent, but the hype around this film makes no sense; almost as much as the 'science' involved."
"Review of Interstellar : Interesting in parts, but I aged 23 years watching it. Derivative of many other films including Contact, 2001, Forbidden Planet, Signs and most egregiously North by Northwest. Worst score in recent memory. Also, some of the special effects are pretty lame--all too obvious when models are being used. Gravity was much more visually arresting. Way too many close up horror expressions. The universe is supposed to be filled by interstellar gas, which must be true, given so much gassy dialog. Nolan manages to work in the Do Not Go Gently Into That Good night poem not once, but four times (look for the last time on a plague at the end."
"Review of Interstellar : Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and 'Inception', though, with the exception of 'Insomnia', I always regarded them as, in the immortal words of Andrew Sarris 'less than meets the eye'. I do not like to call films pretentious, but with 'Memento' and 'Inception' the word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep.The same is, in my opinion, certainly true of 'Interstellar'. Yes, it carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great, and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the destiny of our species. But, my dear Mr Nolan, surely you must realise that our species will not survive by planting American flags on distant planets. And, like 'Gravity' before it, the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the 'starchild' at the end of '2001', he'd punch you in the nose. 'Interstellar' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards the end, is void of any real cultural insight.The film simply extends 'The Wizard of Oz' into the space age and decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. It is TOSH! Great films tell us something memorable about the human condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that the word 'awesome' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case, an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction. Any suggestion that it deserves a Best Picture Oscar is a sad comment on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years."
"Review of Interstellar : Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for most of Nolan's (and his brothers') works, but this one just doesn't rise up to the standard of filmmaking that we're used to from these guys. Where to start? The overtly obvious and cliché ending? If you've seen any movie involving space-time puzzles and paradoxes, you see it coming from miles away. One might say that's not the point of the movie, that we should rather see it as a story of love and affection and whatever. Well, sorry folks, the Nolans seem to talk the talk but they can't walk the walk. The ""dramatic"" content of this film is barely above that of a romantic comedy. It relies too heavily on time paradoxes but doesn't really give us the psychological background of the characters, as to why they do what they do. Some cliché shots: explanation of the worm hole is exactly the same as in Event horizon. The girl running after the car of the departing father, only to be held by another loved one, queue dramatic music- wow, I haven't seen that before. The ""beings"" (or us in the future) simplifying their reality so it suits our cognitive capacities-come on Matthew, you've done that movie already! The robots look like Monoliths from 2001. Well, if you're gonna be inspired by Kubrick, be inspired by the sheer emotional and psychological subtlety and precision that makes 2001 a masterpiece.""Human nature"" is a very easy answer to explain both all the evil and all the goodness that is going on. Yeah we have survival instinct, also compassion for our loved ones, which may come into conflict with the overall goal of our survival as species. So where are all these forced-tear-jerker scenes coming from? What else is new since 2001 or Solaris? Is that all there is to it? A movie with this much ambition and hype was supposed to be a milestone in the genre, but instead it is a faint copy, easily forgettable. What we've seen previously from these guys in films like The Following, Memento and also in Dark Knight, hell, even Inception, is that they really know how to create memorable characters with unique insight into their psychological background. None of that complexity is to be found in this movie. The characters are made from cardboard and they feel like repetitions of other sci- fi movie stereotypes. The dramatic substance of the movie, which is literally thrown to our faces every moment, does not live up to the quality of its' technical execution. Sure the visuals are great, but that's to be expected from a $169 million movie. Music is great too, though sometimes overused, but it's Hans Zimmer for crying out loud. What I enjoyed was the layout of the dystopic future, perhaps a little emphasis on how the world came to be that way would have made for a better and more plausible movie(don't even get me started on the absurd physics of this movie. good luck running from a black-hole).Simply put, this film is by no means a 9, and it simply doesn't qualify for the top250 (though of course there are many titles there which don't qualify even for the top875384)."
"Review of Interstellar : I have to begin this review by acknowledging that I saw this movie under less than optimal conditions - on the screen on the back of a Jet Blue seat. Whatever visual magic might have impressed me was grainy and small, and the sound was murky. There's a good chance I would have liked this film better if seen properly.That being said, I probably wouldn't have liked it a *lot* better, because the things I didn't like would have been the same.First off, I thought the movie was off to a real slow start. It was basically a dust bowl family saga, and while I'll admit you needed some context for what happens later, it felt like it went on much too long.The early space experience also didn't engage me that much. Part of the problem might just be my expectations for a Christopher Nolan movie. I knew almost nothing about this film going in, but I think of Nolan as the director of Inception and Memento, and Interstellar was just so darn straightforward (at least at first).Eventually (the movie is almost three hours, so it really takes its time) the film's more intriguing ideas appear, such as the trickiness of relative time. The movie also becomes more eventful. Yet still there were things I found offputting; the first death in the movie makes no sense; it shouldn't have happened, and realistically wouldn't have. (Later I read a critique that pointed out that the whole scene wouldn't have happened that way unless everyone involved was an idiot.) The movie did, become more engrossing as it got more involved, playing with its time concept and tossed in some interesting twists and suspenseful moments. Alas, whatever gains the movie had made in my heart were squandered in the end. Apparently the movie had a scientist to make sure the science was good, and perhaps it was, yet to me the final part seemed incredibly silly, with way too much leaning on non-science things like intuition. And the last scenes were just .... huh? (Although someone in the IMDb board came up with a very Christopher Nolan interpretation of the end that I found more appealing.)As I say, if I'd seen it on the big screen I might have been more forgiving of its flaws, and it's very possible things like the reportedly hardcore seriousness with which it approached getting the look of a black hole just right would have made its length and plot weaknesses more palatable. But even saying that, I cannot see any way this movie would ever impress me as much as it has others."
"Review of Interstellar : This movie really isn't science fiction so much as fantasy with some mixed up elements of science in it.Sadly the movie lost me in the first 10-20 minutes or so simply because there is no scenario where Earth would have a blight or bad weather which would result in fleeing to wormhole would become a practical solution. On top of that the flight pilot thing is just ridiculous. The likelihood that you pilot through a wormhole based on human skill seems pretty small.So the premise of why people would want to do any of this was 100% flawed. Given X amount of resources the simply reality is that even if Earth is a barren ball of rock, it still has water and it still has the right gravity and better resources. So the solution would clearly be to just work with the Earth, not flee into the unknown in same sensationalized effort to save humanity. It really just makes no sense and when you base the premise and central motivation of your characters in a science fiction movie with a serious overtone like this and that motivation makes no logical sense, it's hard to take anything after that seriously. They may as well have been setting out to look for the Great Flying Spaghetti Monster to grant them the wish that would save humanity. At least that premise would have been honest and not some silly half thought out plot point skimmed over to explain all the uselessly risky decisions the characters would take later in the movie.There is also the whole idea that you'd expect a planet near a black hole to be a better place to live than Earth. It has to been almost infinitely easier to fix the Earth than it could ever be to transport the human population through a wormhole to a planet on the edge of a black hole. Nobody would ever think that was a good idea. As I see it the movie was nothing more than a grand setup to show off the spooky theoretical impacts of relative time differences on humans. The reasoning for their trip was not well thought out and the ending of the movie was total crap. The part most people liked is the spooky sense of how time might pass differently when your near very massive objects. Of course in general it's probably not all that possible to find a habitable planet that close to a black hole. There are many factors beyond the massive gravity that would have either made the planet unlivable or make it simply too risk to call home vs Earth. For the plot to work Earth would have to be about to be vaporized, not merely having bad weather and blight. Those things can be quarantined and engineered around as long as you have water, sunlight, resources and somewhere near the correct gravity. For instance when they are on the planet and the giant tidal bulge that appears out nowhere which would require a very fast planet rotation. Would it not have been immediately apparent that the planet was no in any way a realistic place to move humanity? It would be easier to just terraform Mars or again for that matter to fix Earth. America is currently starved for good science fiction and the high rating of this movie is little more than a result of that. People are so desperate for a good science fiction movie they have overlooked the horrible plot holes. Contact is another example of a horrible movie getting good ratings because people are desperate for science fiction. Even if you say OK, well this movie isn't really science fiction, but it's good. No.. it's just not. It's silly, misleading and completely lacks any kind of well thought out ending. Watching this sad attempt at science fiction is just utterly disappointing. So much money was spent on such a bad plot and instead of instilling the mystery of science in more people it's just a silly mesh of unrealistic scenarios clinging desperately onto science to save the horrible writing. Robots with vacuum cleaner arms from the 1960s are more realistic than the plot holes in this sad movie."
"Review of Interstellar : I am fine with giving it 6 stars for entertainment value. But I am wondering why so many people think this is a great movie!? The movie is far too sentimental, clichéd and not-conforming-to-known-laws-of-physics of the known universe, to earn the status of a 'great' movie.When I say not-conforming-to-known-laws-of-physics, I am not necessarily referring to the worm-holes or time travel. I am referring to simple things like driving a truck with a flat tire through the corn fields.All in all, I like the premise this movie is built upon. Although I have put the spoiler alert in my review, I will still try not to spoil is too much and just say that ""them"" is nothing but future ""us"" is a fascinating concept. And the moral messages in the movie are pretty standard, and I am OK with that too.However, one thing bothers me. I have watched most of the top 100 movies in IMDb and I generally agree with those ratings. The current rating for this movie is not doing justice for other top movies in IMDb. All I am saying it that this does not belong in the first 100. I hope that 'anomaly in the gravity' (pun intended) will be fixed over the time."
"Review of Interstellar : There is a lot I like about this movie. I love the overall themes of the end of mankind on this planet and trying to find a new ""home"". Everything you'd expect to work in a film of this budget does work: It looks awesome, the actors are good, the score is great etc. These things are what make this movie worthy of the prize to a ticket.While I give Nolan credit for taking on these huge themes, I don't think he quite delivers with this one. Of course with a movie like this there's gonna be plot holes and you could nitpick it to peaces and that can be enjoyable part of a movie too. The biggest problem with me was the human side of the story on the emotional elements. I do think Nolan did good job convincing us of how hight the stakes were on this mission. And I enjoyed the elements about the relevance of time and how years past in the earth while they've only experienced a couple of hours. The big human element of the story is the relationship with a father and a daughter and that just doesn't work well enough. It's almost laughable how long it takes for the daughter to forgive her dad for leaving her for the sake of mankind. Even though she works in the same facility that send her dad away in the first place. I guess it's dramatically better that she sends her first message to him when she's the same age he was when he left but it just doesn't make much sense. Also Brand's speech about love being an element that reaches over time and space is just laughable. You could do that with any other emotion and still have it make as much sense. I also found the emotional scenes to bee too manipulative. I just didn't feel for the characters as much as I should have. The scene with Cooper and old Murph was just stupid. They haven't seen in decades and have both experienced more than most people could imagine with huge emotional package. And they spend like two minutes talking to each other. And Coopers grand children and grand-grand children don't even talk to him even though he's supposed to be some kind of a legend. They just silently leave the room when he arrives.In general the movie was just overly chewed and explained. They should have left more stuff up to the interpretation of the viewer 2001's style. But I still don't regret seeing the film. It is quite an experience visually. And for that reason the stuff that doesn't work is such a shame."
"Review of Interstellar : In 1968 countless theatre goers walked out of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey. Should have won Best Picture. And here in 2014 IMDb is giving Interstellar an 8.6 rating . I found this latest film over the top unbelievable! And incredibly silly. The top cast did give a good performance, but felt the acting of both Michael Cain and Matt Dillon not worthy of this script. The entire third act was choreographed wonderfully but again unbelievable and extremely hard to follow.168 minutes was also much too long ., could have been edited to 2 hours . I do give creedance to Christopher Nolan his eye to detail, and didn't include audio to outside space travel, just as Stanley Kubrick did for his Space Opera 50 years before, but the overall audience didn't buy that film eithe.Sorry. I give a 6 rating ."
"Review of Interstellar : A long, tedious movie. It attempts to be an epic but fails. It attempts to say something profound, but the message is garbled. The movie attempts to mix jumbled pseudo-scientific dialogue with a melodramatic subplot involving a father and daughter, producing a muddled story with little dramatic power. The movie contains elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Matrix, with its bombastic musical flourishes and the special effects meant to depict extra-dimensionality, all pure Hollywood. Matthew McConaughey is the principal actor; his character, Cooper, is the central figure of the story; the rest of the cast are supporting characters (their placement in the credits notwithstanding). McConaughey gives an interesting performance, which includes several scenes in which he weeps, which for a leading man is remarkable. The depiction of earth as a doomed planet is unconvincing and the plan to colonize other planets half-baked and one that tests the limits of plausibility. Being a science-fiction movie, stretching the boundaries of science for literary purposes is to be expected, but this movie asks the audience to accept certain premises that just do not make sense (e.g, acceleration of time; relationship of time to gravity; time as a material object). This movie is proof that when Hollywood attempts to deal with time warps, time holes, multi-dimensionality, relativity, and other complex scientific theories, the results can be less than optimum."
"Review of Interstellar : Let me bring you this in overview. PRO: - Stunning visually, through and through - Good acting by the entire cast - Interesting concept - A strong second half - A somewhat satisfying ending - A few interesting twists - The main musical theme is amazing. CON: - It took too long for anything truly interesting to happen. It had a few good moments, but in general the whole first half of the movie was... a tiny bit boring. If it hadn't been a Nolan movie, I would probably have left in the break. I'm glad I didn't. But the first half makes me not want to see this movie again. - There are really too many plot holes. Or moments that are not well-explained enough for them to be plausible. Things like characters experiencing revelations based on... well, pretty much nothing. Especially near the end. Which doesn't take away from the awesomeness of the second half. But one has to overlook these things to enjoy the story. - Besides the main theme, most of the score seem misplaced. Too loud. Too bombastic. Or not adding to the emotions on screen. And I'm speaking as a huge Hans Zimmer fan here.All in all, I would recommend seeing it. Definitely. But with an expectation that it's not as special as we've come to expect from Nolan."
"Review of Interstellar : There are moments during ""Interstellar"" which may be compared to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (a better movie). There are moments during ""Interstellar"" which may be compared to ""Prometheus"" (also, a better movie). There are even moments and storytelling techniques within ""Interstellar"" that are completely ripped off from ""Inception"" (a much better movie, from Christopher Nolan himself). That said, ""Interstellar"" should still be touted as the most ambitious film of the year so far, and in the same breath, should ultimately go down as one of director Christopher Nolan's worst films to date.This highly anticipated Nolan project depicts a future riddled with dust storms, where the world's food supply is nearly depleted (or at least 40 to 60 years out from being depleted, but that doesn't sound nearly as dire) where astronauts are working as farmers and children are taught that the Apollo space missions were faked. During this time, an underground government institution called NASA commissions a group of astronauts (including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway) for a top secret space mission. This mission will have them traveling through a newly discovered wormhole, with the promise of finding another inhabitable world.OK, let's get right to it. Any praise I heap upon this movie will be directed at the final 90 minutes of this two hour and 49 minute long film, since the first 80 or so minutes of ""Interstellar"" (while absolutely gorgeous at times to behold) is drenched in sequences of McConaughey seemingly reenacting moments from those pretentious Lincoln car ads, caught in a continuous and almost finger wagging diatribe about how the human race was never meant to die on earth, which nearly put me to sleep. In other words, the first half of this is as slow and lifeless as watching a dead astronaut drift through space. Anyway, this is Intersellar's fatal flaw, since the latter half is ripe with big budget yet very symbolic action sequences, stunning cinematography and fascinating talking points dealing with the nature of human survival in the face of an unsympathetic universe, due to some really insightful slabs of dialogue from a script written by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan. Even the literal rocket science lingo becomes more and more palatable as the ""gravity"" of this plot begins to set in, near the midpoint of Act 2.Final Thought/The Ending: Allow me to take a quick spoiler free moment to discuss this ending. During the final act of ""Interstellar"", for most film nerds, Nolan's story will be encroaching on the hallowed grounds of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Some will admire the sheer ballsyness of what he does in this pivotal moment and others will find it in bad taste. Though this is not a huge issue, since I don't believe this niche group will have much effect on ticket sales, the problem is that for the millions who didn't see ""Interstellar"" for any film school aesthetic reason, Nolan's ending will simply come off as so strange and obnoxiously far-fetched, that many may leave the theater angry that the punch-line wasn't worth the nearly three hour set up."
"Review of Interstellar : I won't give it a 1 to even things up a little, I give it a 6 which is real. Maybe 6.5 but 7 would be a stretch. I'm disappointed with a film that I waited for so long, with a great title that was waisted. Interstellar should have been a masterpiece, with, well, a lot of Interstellar traveling. The duration is just to long, especially the first part, which brings nothing extra to the story. It's just to stretched out trying to bring I don't know what. A feel of 2001 maybe, but 2001 is in another galaxy for this one. I didn't like Inception either, so maybe it has got to be something with Nolan. I'm a sci-fi fan, but today everyone's trying to make sci-fi, but they don't succeed. They are doing it wrong! District 9 was the last good sci-fi I watched. Interstellar has got great visuals, I give it that, but Gravity had more (another film that sucked big time). I wouldn't watch it again."
"Review of Interstellar : The movie is incredibly beautiful but it is not intelligent but is mostly a strange mix that does not quite know what it wants. I like it when science and technology are described believable which at times is the case here, but just as in the masterpiece in 2001, it falls hard when you mix in philosophy with a high level of abstraction. Of course there are more holes in the script than can be listed here. One obvious to me is that if the descendants of humanity are those that make us survive Who was it that saved us the first time?We meet several parallel stories and my 14 year old daughter even shed a tear over something she could not quite explain afterwards. We meet the stories about how humans devastated the earth's resources, technophobia and heroes immortality. The only person who seems quite realistic, however, Matt Daemon. It's like his mixture of malice, selfishness and cowardice doing so the movie gets off the ground for a short while. And it is of course not good for a film largely set in space (pun intended)."
"Review of Interstellar : ""Interstellar"" was an above average film and I have no regrets spending a Friday night checking it out. Unsophisticated audiences may enjoy it if they don't analyze it too deeply. However, if you are one who understands the world of physics, aviation, or space travel, this one is hard to watch. There are a plethora of continuity issues as well as plot holes. It seems like Chris Nolan watched ""Gravity"" and decided he could make a really terrible film into something worth watching. He added the ""Contact"" premise and inserted some Physics theories and some expanded back story to create a mediocre film. I was hopeful that I would be impressed by the obviously inflated reviews but I wasn't. The guy next to me actually fell asleep during the first hour which was very grueling. Of our group, there were three thumbs down and one thumbs up."
"Review of Interstellar : I went into this movie knowing little about it, no plot details, or even whether christopher nolan was director or just a producer. I have enjoyed nolans previous movies, but i don't care who is behind the camera aslong as the film is serving it's purpose which is to entertain.So half an hour goes by, the tone is set. There is a crisis with the crops,earth is running out of food, a lot of dust, no explanation for any of it, just accept it. the film is pretty humourless and lot of mumbling about nothing interesting in particular from the lead..he's an ex nasa pilot who has a farm...sits on the porch drinking a beer and gets philosophical with john lythgow ...more mumbling. Struggling to stay awake.Okay so the next act things pick up, we have loud launch into space, I'm awake again. Then silence, after all that's whats space is like y'know. Can now hear people munching popcorn. Too quiet. Oh look huge water planet, vast and empty much like this film so far. Huge wave comes.Ah some entertainment at last, clunky robot runs around... then Matt damon ! the last act, blackholes and then there is an semi interesting twist to earlier events.This was a frustrating film, had a lot of potential with the story but on an entertaining and thought provoking level it doesn't get there. It starts and stalls. Did anyone really care about the characters? i certainly didn't invest. Obviously some people love it with the scores on here but i cannot agree.This is not a masterpiece in sci-fi by any means. There are comparisons to 2001 but don't even go there.I actually looked at my watch towards the end of the film to see how long I'd been trapped in this cinematic black hole."
"Review of Interstellar : A decent movie with a lot of production values and star power but at the end is just too surrealistic. You'll hear all the usual imdb rants: magnificent, a triumph, a masterpiece but its all overblown. Slowing a movie down making it mysterious and putting the stakes so high only gets you so far.The movies starts well and who can't get enough of Anne Hathaway's gorgeous face but like the heralded soundtrack after a while it is overhelming.Not every Christopher Nolan movie is a masterpiece from frame to frame. Not every action or lack of action has earth shattering consequence. Sometime its just a highly produced and directed movie that should of had a fresh pair of eyes look at the script before it went into production."
"Review of Interstellar : Got to watch it on in IMAX format last night and found the IMAX experience disappointing, still trying to understand if the effort to shoot in 70mm was worth it. Same low def, blurry type of delivery as watching Gravity on a plane. Mentioned Gravity at the outset, as it comes to mind more often while watching Interstellar than Kubrick's 2001, I guess not what Nolan brothers were shooting for... So, a 2nd display of spinning debris in the cosmic emptiness in 12 months, while trying to make this cinematically thrilling and engaging denotes some sort of gumption, not that Hollywood haven't seen that kind of FX sequeling so many times. Let's say that making movies in 2014 about stuff in space is not easy, in a space where sound waves don't travel and silent movies are long extinct for a reason. Interstellar however is not a very quiet movie at all, lot of vibrating spacecraft and gripping soundtrack as fillers. Kubrick got that right back in 68 using the Blue Danube to keep us connected to the scenes that everyone ever since used as textbook on any extraterrestrial imagery. Nolan is telling a very simple story in a not very precise and confident rendering, adding several disjointed mini-stories in the main one, and ending it with the grand reunion of all characters that have not died explicitly on screen after 2 and a half hours and basically telling the world that time travel is possible and it will be soon available at a farm near you.I will be brief on my rating of the main cast: Matt McCon is looking more and more like Peter Newman in the 70s and getting pretty good, followed by Jess Chastain with solid delivery, the rest are a mess: Anne Hathaway is 3/10 and Matt Damon, boy ... what happened to him ? Michael Caine is OK, but no cigar. The plot is pretty shabby when looked from above (pun intended)and the mini new age anecdotes are kept in check until the last half hour when we are subjected to full blown loss of control over what/when/how/where.. anything goes, keep calm and wait until everyone's standing up.Wait for the video."
"Review of Interstellar : How do we begin to describe 'Interstellar', Christopher Nolan's most ambitious film to date? There will probably be no doubt, once you've seen it, that it reaches for the stars; whether it manages to get there is quite something else altogether. Whereas 'Inception' showed the filmmaker's refusal to be restrained by physical dimension, his latest sees him attempt to take an even bigger leap across space and time, envisioning our three-dimensional reality as part of a larger five-dimensional whole, and employing some of the very best technical wizards to create such wondrously dazzling visuals that you cannot help but be mesmerised.By imagery alone, it is flawless. A dying dust-choked planet Earth in the near future is depicted in a somewhat familiar yet eerily unsettling landscape of agrarian society. A single spacecraft is seen as a gleaming spark against Saturn's giant gaseous rings. Bright flashes alternate with pitch darkness as the same spacecraft enters a wormhole to emerge in a different galaxy. Each planet we explore in this brand new world is a sight to marvel in itself - one an endless expanse of water where waves rise higher than the eye can see; another is pure ice, where even the clouds are snow chunks. And amidst such surreal beauty, the one scene that will probably stay in your head for a while is that of different moments in time as a binary puzzle, meant to illustrate a key relationship in the film about gravity and time.Since his breakthrough hit 'Memento', Christopher has displayed a fascination with twisting time, and 'Interstellar' is no different. It may unfold in a largely linear fashion, but it plays with time more than you realise. On one hand, time is relative, such that one hour on a foreign planet counts for seven Earth years passed - so much so that while Matthew McConaughey's NASA test pilot named Cooper looks the same throughout the film, Timothee Chalamet and Mackenzie Foy as his 15- year son Tom and 10-year old daughter Murphy are replaced midway by Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain respectively. That is the easier part - and then there is the scientific mumbo-jumbo that sees time in the context of black holes, gravitational singularities and the possibility of extra-dimensional space.Another hallmark of Christopher's films has been their cerebral aspirations, but 'Interstellar' surpasses all his previous works by (over)reaching into an unnecessarily convoluted labyrinth of hokey quantum physics. To be sure, it is very serious about being serious, throwing about plenty of technical dialogue and making no apologies for assuming that its audience for smart intelligent beings. A lot of that will undoubtedly whiz by on the first viewing, but by trying to engage on such an intellectual level, it ultimately becomes the cause of its undoing with a logic-defying second half that cross- cuts furiously between Cooper in a race-against-time up in space and Murphy in a similar position back on Earth. Even without thinking too much into it, one already gets the nagging sense that it violates its very own relativity principle of one hour versus seven years.Yet ironically, that is also the most entertaining segment of the film, which otherwise spends too much time (in Earth years, we may add) on melodramatic partings and monotonous stretches in space. With his brother, Johnathan, Christopher wraps the heady interstellar voyage around the bond between parent and child, or more specifically, that between Cooper and Murphy, who takes the parting especially badly; but these supposedly heart-rending scenes at the start are overwrought, and no thanks to Hans Zimmer's incessantly intrusive score, terribly manipulative. In contrast, a simple scene where the camera is simply trained on Cooper as he cries his eyes out watching years and years of backlogged video messages left by his son back on Earth is much more poignant - and without a soundtrack that instructs you how to feel.Much as Christopher tries to ground the movie in the humanity between Cooper and Murphy, 'Interstellar' is better appreciated as an exposition on big ideas - and there are many bandied about here. Mankind's place in space is encapsulated in McConaughey's lament that ""we used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars; now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt"". Much later on, Matt Damon pops up to make an emphatic point about survival as the primal instinct, and by that, we mean survivial of the individual, not the human race. That is nicely contrasted against the motivation behind Cooper's mission itself, which his mentor Professor Brand (Michael Caine) reveals on his deathbed to be much more selfless - or selfish, depending on your perspective - than what he had initially told Cooper.Similarly, 'Interstellar' is a film of many contradictions. It wants so desperately to be intellectual, so it grounds its science in the theories of renowned CalTech physicist Kip Thorne, but it violates these principles in favour of building a more thrilling (and complex) narrative. It wants to be moving, but it under-develops the relationships between its characters and then tries to wring emotion out of every intimate scene. And at the heart of it is an unblinking motivation to be important, to be significant, to be monumental, to matter like Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece did, and to be both science and fiction at the same time. Indeed, there is no doubt it reaches for the stars, but 'Interstellar' remains right where we are - gazing up at these constellations, and never quite getting any closer to them."
"Review of Interstellar : A movie that starts out very strong, great acting and a great storyline that seemed to deteriorate halfway through."
"Review of Interstellar : The problem is... Stellar is so complex and confusing you are at the mercy of tying together so many scientific issues you get bogged down in the constant slow dialog and the dragging delivery of the twists and turns of what has got to be the most complex multi-plotted movie I've seen in years. I sensed ""overkill"" of some scenes that seemed constantly drawn out that if I had a remote I would have fast forwarded through many parts. I am a big Sci-Fi movie lover and as such I will bring huge praise to the writers and producers of well made movies of this kind. Before going to see this much anticipated film that was given spectacular and high praise from several cites such as IMDb, I was dumbfounded by what appeared to be a movie almost impossible to find fault with in those reviews. Whats more this film was much too long (2 hrs 55 minutes) including previews of trailers. No human bladder should be put to such an ungodly test. Lastly I want to again point out that many reviews are suspect in this world of questionable truths of opinion."
"Review of Interstellar : DISCLAIMER: I'm in general, a huge Nolan fan.There are times when you can ignore plot holes in films, and times when you can't. You can overlook some when the pacing is fast, or when the film doesn't take itself too seriously. Unfortunately, Interstellar does neither - it's unnecessarily slow and takes itself really, really seriously. And it's full of plot holes, fallacies, paradoxes, and logic taking a beating in general, to fulfill some emotional quotient - which, I must say, worked on most people.Let's start with the whole premise the film is based on - in the future, earth's resources have been drained, and everyone has turned into farmers - with conscious efforts to eradicate science education in general to force people to go into farming. Let's take a moment here to realize just how ridiculous that premise is.Moving on - our protagonist is a genius NASA astronaut/engineer turned farmer (because, y'know, everyone's a farmer) - and the first half mostly shows him bonding with his family, with completely unnecessary scenes to prolong the film - like taking down a lost drone (by pointing things towards it), which had no relation to the story later whatsoever. Then our hero stumbles onto a NASA facility (if you aren't a farmer, you're with NASA) after decoding things which occurred due to... uhh, gravitational anomalies. This NASA facility, as claimed by uberscientist Michael Caine, was humanity's best kept secret, though 5 minutes into that - all our hero's family members were informed about it. So anyways, since our hero stumbled into the facility anyway, uberscientist decides to send him into space to save humanity because, well, just like that. We get to see our hero saying goodbye to his family and immediate fast forward - he's in space! No training, no nothing! Economic storytelling, certainly, and it would've worked, had the other ""scientists"" on board later didn't have to explain things and plans to him on the fly (which, for all intents and purposes, should've been explained before leaving) - and having conversations that were mostly like what college freshmen studying physics would have. (Oh, and discussions about love! Love transcending all dimensions - when humanity is at stake!)Anyway, so future earth has the technology to do all this, and build robot A.I.s which were more human than most humans, but it doesn't have doctors any more, or any other visible technological advancements for that matter. All efforts to save humanity were concentrated on ONE and just ONE uberscientist, who'd been working on his cure-all formula for years. And every other scientist have just been waiting for him to solve it all himself! (And what's this? Other nations you ask? Well there ain't no other nation apart from the USA to do earth saving, is there?) This is something I particularly take offense to, scientists don't work that way.So, Nolan throws more science at us on the fly, which everyone dodges. But in the end, everything is explained by, yep, five dimensional space! Somehow our hero gets into such a space, goes back in time (opening up a ton of paradoxes), behind a bookshelf in 5D space, and uses vague messages to communicate with his daughter back in time, instead of giving clear messages like ""I'm your father back in time"". His daughter, when all grown up - suddenly realizes that it was his father all along and we get no clue as to how she got to that conclusion - but hey, PLOT TWIST! And with that new information, she becomes the new uberscientist, saving everyone. How? By making an orbiting space station around Saturn (for which you somehow required ""quantum data"" from other galaxies and black holes?). So okay uhh... it's complicated.There are however, some great visuals (3D would've done justice) and soundtrack in this, and hence the 5 - but ultimately nothing we haven't seen before. Beyond all that glitter, there's no gold - just a forgettable movie."
"Review of Interstellar : So, did I get this right? The essence of time-space relativity is that you're able to see a younger version of yourself from behind a bookcase, and shout in vain that you shouldn't do what you're about to do? Yes, that's how silly this movie is. 'Interstellar' is supposed to be a film exploring Einstein's relativity theory. It shows how space travelers enter a 'wormhole' to find new planets where they can find a future for mankind, which is suffering from heat, drought and hunger on planet Earth. By doing so, they enter a parallel time frame where one hour equals seven years on earth. The problem is that the film is tackling this subject in such a clumsy way that it makes you laugh rather than anything else. Take the robots that assist the space travelers during their voyage through time and space. Are we really to believe that thinking computers in the future would take the form of clunky metal boxes, assembled in such a way that they can walk on two legs? I would suppose an intelligent operating system for a smart phone or iPad would be much more convenient. In that respect, 'Her' was much more realistic. I could go on. How about a top scientist saying things like: 'Only love transcends time and space, so why don't we put our trust in that?' Or how about handing the command of the space ship that's supposed to save the human race to a farmer who finds the secret launching pad by coincidence? And how about the only woman in the crew being in love with another space traveler who is lost somewhere on another planet? Apart from this, there are several other things about this film I didn't like. The over-the-top soundtrack, filled with some sort of church organ music. The artificial dialogues, mostly intended to explain unexplainable things. The numerous melodramatic and tear-jerking scenes. The subtle message that love is superior to science. The countless scenes of the space ship shuddering and rattling, as if it were a Boeing flying through a patch of turbulence. I had hoped this big budget production by a talented director like Christopher Nolan could appeal to non sci-fi fans like me. But I was disappointed."
"Review of Interstellar : I do not know what kind of PR team the production team has hired to promote this film, but obviously they are doing great job as it has already higher score than Inception... Seriously guys??? This film has 5/10 stars at best, and even that for just potential. Rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it.Stupid, illogical and at times really boring and long. Even though I am no scientist, it was so stupid on so many levels with even the most basic of facts that I have no comments to this....Set your expectations low- no way in hell does this film deserve any of that praise posted here...."
"Review of Interstellar : Not a terrible movie but not half as good as some reviewers would have you believe. Firstly a lot has been made of you needing a degree in quantum physics to understand the movie. Not so, the premise is exactly the same as his last move 'inception', time moves slower the deeper you go or in this case nearer the event horizon of a black-hole. Don't need to be a genius to understand that.Secondly a lot has been made of his revolutionary mixing of 'dazzling' science fiction and an intimate human story. As for the human story, it's clunky and at times cringe-worthy. It's dull and not particularly well handled with amateurish dialogue characteristic of the Nolan films. If you want to see a movie where the relationship between father and daughter is far better handled watch 'Contact'. As for the science fiction I'd have to say I was disappointed. Parts were very spectacular but I was not impressed by the planet scenes. Iceland yet again and a water planet with shallow seas and massive waves? I was somehow expecting more than this.Overall grossly over-rated by the critics yet go and see it all the same."
"Review of Interstellar : SPOILER FREE BEGINS *********I had a sneaking feeling that Christopher Nolan was a director who wasn't particularly good at staging emotional sequences, nor had a special skill in staging action sequences nor has consistency in his screen writing which may range from mediocre (The Dark Knight Rises and overall logical setup of the Batman series) or sublime (Memento, Inception). What always worked for Nolan was that his movies were always interesting and always intriguing and if the script was any good, he made classics.Interstellar represents a colossal failure of Nolan on every front imaginable. Let's start with the plot which is the most looked forward thing in his movies. The plot involving the World's end and the attempt to save it via Interstellar travel is so hokey that you may think you are watching a Michael Bay movie. If you could complain about ""Gravity""s leaps of logic, then you will realize there is absolutely no physical logic in this script. The story is a Galaxy sized plot hole. The sad part is that it isn't even original which you would come to expect from the Nolan Brothers. It's a bad mishmash of Gravity, Coherence, 2001 a Space Odyssey and Contact book ended by a cringe inducing emotional thread that it will compel you to flay your hands in the air over the inept acting, dialogues, staging, and poor editing, story and what not. If you were expecting an ""Inception"" than don't, Interstellar has the most contrived sci- fi plot in existence coupled with bad acting. It's Armageddon with a sense of higher purpose. At least I enjoyed Armageddon.SPOILER FREE ENDS ********Now back to the plot points. Lets talk about the plot. The world is ending, and I could not fathom why, nor could Nolan show us the World in a broad sense apart from one single corn field farm in the middle of nowhere which conveniently houses an ultra secret project by NASA. If the world is ending, who will save it? Of course the ""Aliens"" or ""They"" (insert oooooooooooh). I thought the movie would involve humans discovering Interstellar travel.I never went into the movie thinking that a huge big ass Worm Hole was conveniently placed by 5- Dimensional unexplained aliens as a convenient plot device to jump into the whole space travel thingy. How hokey is that? And the hokum continues with supremely bad exposition ever committed on screen with fellow astronauts explaining how worm holes work (""Ah it's shaped like a sphere!) or how time dilation works in relativity theory. It seems like none of Johnathan or Christopher could truly grasp how these concepts should work in the context of the film and hence these appear as contrived elements in the service of producing cheap thrills (""oh we lost so many years"").And talking about cheap thrills, can anyone possibly out there condone how stupid the middle reveal was with our famous cameo from a famous actor? Okay let's talk about the ending. One can apparently fly into a black hole, make contact with 5-Dimensional entities who will present you a menu of quantum states of possibilities in order to save the world by how? How? By transmitting some mumbo-jumbo data via Morse Code through a ticking hand of a watch to a woman on the other side of the space time continuum so that she can umm fit it into the equation? or was it a constant? what is a 5 pager formula? How did it work? Hokey as hell.And the visuals? Oh the problem is since Gravity came out and took the crown of the best space visuals in the last 5 years, what could Instellar do? Well lets have some obviously fake looking CGI dust clouds. Have your space ship fly over a Windows wallpaper of Saturn. How was any of it ""Original""? Let's look at the planet. One has Water with a fake wall of waves, one has simply ice. That's it. Water and Ice. Where did you spend your money on Mr Nolan? Oh the Robots were hilarious but you would cringe in your seats thinking how a rectangular block of moving pillar was a good Robot Design and how the poor chap was managing to run on flat ground.And the acting? Cringeworthy Mumblecore.I don't think even the fanboys can save this one."
"Review of Interstellar : I'm not a Nolan fan but I always want to give his movies a try because mostly I do like the general ideas for the stories that are told. I really tried to watch this one without prejudice. And after it was done, I sat there with the same feeling that I had after Inception: it's interesting but there is so much unnecessary ""action"" and plot holes that it loses so much of its potential. And that's sad!The first 40 minutes or so are really slow. After that the tempo goes up but so many details are overlooked that it becomes a bit hard to watch. This makes me very cynical and looking at the clock to see when the movie will be over. Also, playing with time is such an interesting idea but it has to be done right and you can't just be sloppy with details like I've seen more than a few times in this film.I wasn't crazy about McConaughey's performance, I kinda liked Hathaway. The visuals are good but I put on 2001: A Space Odyssey right after I finished Interstellar and to me these graphics are just as good, even though they're almost 50 years old. And the mood and eerie atmosphere are loads better! Besides, Interstellar seemed like a bit of a remake of 2001, and as is usually the case with remakes, not better than the original.I gave Interstellar a 5 star rating because of the concept and the effects."
"Review of Interstellar : Firstly, I quite like the movie in terms of visuals and the sound track. About 10 minutes in though, I find myself wishing for sub-titles as the actors' voices are inaudible. (I like MM but where is Clooney when we need him?) Now, the story idea is not half bad except Nolan misunderstood the meaning of Sci-Fi...the fiction part of 'Science Fiction' refers to the science portion of a narrative, not the human story. Leaps of faith can be justified with stretching science, especially in areas not fully understood/known by people. The human part of the story has to be true for the audience to relate to (unless there is a setting in the story for human evolution that makes them different to what we are now.) Too many illogical human behaviours are just strung together to move this along and I believe Nolan hoped that the great visuals will distract us from thinking about what is going on. I will highlight a few that ruined the movie for me, even though plenty more were present. Watch out...spoilers below!1)Murph had experienced the 'ghost' from a young age yet didn't know who it might be; yet, when we find out that the 'ghost' is Cooper, she suddenly comes to the same realisation?!? That is of course essential to the story or otherwise she will not take what he transmits seriously, yet there is no reason for her to link the 'ghost' to her father. He could have easily added a message of 'This is your dad' to her, but he never did; and even if he had, it wouldn't work with the younger Murph...if he had located the older Murph (when she was retrieving her stuff), then maybe it will make more sense...very lazy story telling here as it could have been easy to add (maybe 20 seconds of screen time?). This one thing is key to the later part of the movie and without it; the movie couldn't go along the lines it did.2)Assuming we accept that Tor and Cooper did work out the mystery of the black hole that relates to their calculation and he transmitted all the data through her watch. Even if she did figure out that it's a message from her dad (or from someone important), she wasn't paying attention to the message. It is like tuning in to a radio talk show (on serious maths no less) mid-way through a program, there is no way for her to decipher the full message if she missed the first large chunk of what was sent.3)He knew that the message 'Stay' wouldn't work to keep him on the ground. Shouldn't he try a different message? Of course, that would change history and likely Nolan didn't want to go near this paradox...but this is Sci-Fi and I'd welcome the debate that would bring...instead, he rehashes the same old, knowing it wouldn't work.4)Young Murph was understandably upset with her dad when he left...but she becomes part of mission control? Hang on...she has firsthand knowledge of what her father is up to... she knows about plan A, Plan B and the importance of the mission...yet, she wouldn't send him a message? If she became someone outside the scientific field, I can at least accept her continued anger, but putting her in mission control makes it unacceptable. (She should at least be so upset that she wants no part of a mission control which sent her dad away. Otherwise, she should understand why he had to go. ) 5) Murph has a space station named after her so she has some cloud on 'her' space station. When she suggested that Coop goes to Brand, she could help with getting him a spacecraft. Instead, he had to steal one...really? Security is not a concern in the future? A guy who has been out of the loop for almost a century just walks into and starts up a craft, knows all the correct codes to open air locks and even the way out?? (Maybe unlike now, aerospace technology does not improve in a century?) The above really killed the movie for me.Sidenotes:A) If according to their plan, skimming just outside the gravity field to go into the water planet quickly, they surely didn't spend 3+ hours there. How did it translate to 23 years? (Well, I spent almost 3 hours watching this nonsense, so maybe it is possible. Not in the way it was shown though.) B) If all of Cooper's electronics failed on entering the black hole, how did TOR survive? TOR is fully electronics! Poor story telling as this could be explained under sci-fi rules yet wasn't done.C) Why would Murph travel 2 years to the space station, with all her family in tow, to visit her father...yet on seeing him, sends him away?D) Dr Mann and Cooper walked to the edge of the cliff...yet Brand takes a few minutes on a spacecraft to reach there? She took so long that Dr Mann had the time to WALK back to the station to board the other spacecraft, before they FLY back. Ridiculous! (Nolan, this is not a commercial flight... flying cannot be so much slower than walking by any stretch of the imagination.) Overall, without a logical human story, Interstellar is just a decent visual and sound show...its almost 3 hours play time is too long when audience is not absorbed into the tale.I gave it a 5 because I did enjoy some part of the movie (the effects and sound), otherwise, it would get a 3.5 out of 10. Almost 3 hours in a cinema is way too much for this lazily told story. (Plus, there's a chance you'll age 23 years.) I sure wouldn't watch it again."
"Review of Interstellar : I am baffled by the near universal praise this movie is receiving here on IMDb. Out of 2 hours and 49 minutes: about a half hour was spent watching people crying - every star got their turn; about a half hour was spent watching people docking spacecraft with their joysticks under great duress. Really? With that AI robot thingie we can't automate the docking? And what oh what does docking add to the story? about another half hour was spent watching Matt Damon in a dead-end downer subplot;and then another half hour was spent watching cornfields burning in the distance - why? Just, why?So right there we could cut the movie down to about an hour, and we will only have about 40 minutes left to go. Leaving maybe 10 minutes or so that were visually interesting... moderately. There were no visual breakthroughs of any kind in this movie - zip.And listen, I am a lifetime sci-fi fan. So the movie had a wormhole, and some time distortion. Please, is that in itself enough to satisfy anybody who cares about this stuff or do you maybe have to elaborate and get creative?There was simply nothing of unusual intelligence or quality in this movie. Not the writing, not the acting, not the directing, not the visuals.In the large theatre where I saw this with hundreds of people, one person starting clapping at the end. And the crowd laughed.If you're a Christopher Nolan fanboy, then by all means go and enjoy yourself and give it a ten. If that's not you, spend the time doing your taxes or something, you will thank me."
"Review of Interstellar : It's not a bad movie, but it's ordinary at best. Dialogue is very clumsy at times. It's too long, and way too much time is spent on explaining phenomenons that don't need to be explained. It could have been such an elegant and thought provoking movie, but instead it's dead set on explaining absolutely everything. It ruins the mystery, and the opportunity for me to use my own imagination. Unfortunately the time spent making sure that everyone in the audience understands the movie EXACTLY the way the director wants you to, is spent, at the expense of a good storyline and the development of believable characters and meaningful relationships. A funny idea, and a powerful soundtrack, just doesn't cut it for me. I was very underwhelmed and disappointed, but go see for yourself."
"Review of Interstellar : ""Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space.""Void. Then, as the monologue continues, the void is filled with cringe. ""Oh, Nolan"", I think to myself. ""Will you ever be able not to take gigantic resources as means to tell over-complicated, spectacle-centered stories that lack emotion?"". But of course, these thoughts probably won't reach Nolan anytime soon, and my internal monologue will only be shared with you guys. Let's get into it.Interstellar is a 2014 film, directed by the beloved and critically acclaimed Christopher Nolan. The movie follows a group of astronauts on a race against time to save humanity from extinction, looking for a new home planet for our race. Apropos a race against time, time has a lot of meaning in this film - a foreboding, looming presence that you fight against, a sacrifice you make, your one-way ticket to the end of everything you know. At least, this is what the film is trying to communicate.Nolan, who has delivered great material in the past (as of the time I'm writing this review, Memento is in my top 15 films of all time) but also lacking-in-emotion, over-complicated stuff (The Prestige being a prime example of that, and I think I might've been a little soft giving score to this film). I recommend reading my review to The Prestige for more insight about the way Nolan approaches cinema, but in short, I think that Nolan's biggest problem is looking at cinema as if it was a magic trick, as if the only thing that matters is to surprise and amaze. His way of doing that is turning to spectacles, to complicated concepts with cool visuals, but by doing so he often compromises the emotional aspect of the film, and the flow of the story, too.In this case, I feel like most aspects of the film are just okay, just there to support those massive moments regarding time and space. The amount of work going into some of the visuals is truly magnificent, but I feel like I can't be moved by this film, not really. The characters are far from being three dimensional or interesting, only managing to be just a little above the bare minimum needed to sustain the plot. The dialogue is nothing more than okay - decent at its best moments, cringe-worthy at its worst.I mean, the only thing truly working here is the film's way with the most epic moments of the story, the moments that make you feel how powerless, how small humans are in comparison to the universe in general. I'll also admit that the pacing felt much worse on first watch, when so much of the film went on and on about scientific terms and laws of physics (the dialogue felt super forced here) and then tried to push this half-baked philosophy about the importance of love (which was forced, too, and definitely felt like Nolan's poor attempt in finding an excuse to this film's concept) that I felt like it just crawled sometimes. On rewatch you know what to expect, and I could let myself enjoy the more fun moments, the grand moments, easing into the spectacle as much as I could.Still - spectacle doesn't compensate for the dryness of anything else. This is maybe to worst thing about this film - it thinks it's deep or smart when it isn't, not at all. The grandest moments work best, the ""philosophical"" moments or the moments in which the film tries to outsmart the viewer...well, this is Nolan's biggest weakness as a director. It's not horrible, but it's disappointing in its utter mediocrity. I'm feeling a 5.7/10 on this one."
"Review of Interstellar : Even the title Interstellar evokes greatness, and the movie express this greatness through terrific photography supported by great picture quality (go to IMAX 70mm) and definitely communicated by soundtrack. Nolan knows that when you have Hans Zimmer on board you have an insurance: with his music you can transform even your dog daily service in an epic movie. Moreover the movie has a wonderful editing which give a great pace to the story. 9/10 on everything up to now. But when it comes down to the plot we barely reach 6/10. I will never understand why those Hollywood mega-productions that can do everything and have all these great subjects cannot avoid to make trivial mistakes across the plot. While looking at the movie it is like realizing that some good person had great ideas starting from the subject following with great details like the dust, the robots, the hibernation beds, and then somebody comes and place here and there some very simple mistakes. Here some:First of all,the whole thing does not add up: the first time Cooper leave earth, who sent him the NASA coordinate?? NON SENSE.second, at the starting of the movie you know the ending because too much emphasis has been placed on the message 'STAY'. I understand it adds a lot of drama to the departure scene but really spoils the ending. From there on you are only curious on how he will communicate back, which became clearer while watching the rest of the movie.Third, I loved the transition between the departure from home with the truck and the rocket launch BUT wait a moment. Three stages Saturn V rocket to reach the Earth orbit (..OK they were using spares from Apollo mission..OK..) and in all the rest of the movie these guys land and launch from 3 different earth-like planets by using simply the small spacecraft??? C'mon. Fourth, OK, you are trapped and the only person who can save humanity by communicating through time and what is the first thing you send to your daughter? Of course binary coded coordinates of NASA installation!! Not your name, not her name, but coordinates of the NASA launch site, so that the younger-yourself can LEAVE!If only all that you want is for him to STAY which is what you will send immediately after. OK maybe he do not know that he, him self, will start the whole thing just by following those coordinates..:/ WTF!!why?? Guys, I can understand you need to send Cooper to NASA, but couldn't you find something else?Fifth. This is minor, but really annoys me that in 2014, in the Interstellar production, you, screenwriters team, need AGAIN to make someone to slide and fall and trap her leg to create AGAIN the run-for-it-but-I-cant scene, on a planet in which every minute is a year wasted in the search for humanity salvation and to bring back some unknown data!? C'MON! You guys, have the best technicians and movie artisans, can afford almost everything you like, then again, why you have to slide on the banana peel? I will never understand."
"Review of Interstellar : Christopher Nolan has made some great films, but alas, this isn't one of them. It's not a bad film, but as sci-fi, it misses the target. A film about alien life forms is credible, because it's possible, but a film that mumbles abstract nonsense about a relationship between quantum data, time and five dimensions, that puts a primary character behind a bookcase to observe what's going on in front of the bookcase while unable to communicate through the books had me shaking my head. And then, in what seemed like an eternity later, in a silly and inconvenient way he does communicate. Also, I'm still wondering about the significance of the drone chase sequence. Particularly distracting was when HE rose from the pod. Maybe if I'd known he was in the movie would have prepared me for it, but it came across as an unintended joke. And the constant crying by every one of the characters was just too much. Reportedly costing $165 million to make, the money sure doesn't show up on the screen. For all the questionable raves about the effects, among other things, I wasn't wowed by them at all. A dark color palette full of dull grays was far from inspiring, as good science fiction should be and it came across on the screen as being low budget to me. Visually, it was no Oblivion. The relationships and drama between the characters is the main focus of the film with space and time travel serving only as a device to advance and put some quirkiness into that plot line. As I said, it's not a bad film. Without the lofty expectations of seeing top notch sci-fi from a great film maker, it still had some good dramatic and emotional moments that held my attention, largely because the actors threw their all into it and because Hans Zimmer's great score made some overly long sequences seem way more exciting that they were. Here's hoping Mr. Nolan gets back on track next time out."
"Review of Interstellar : Special effects are the real winner in this movie, not the plot, not the acting. Most of the story makes little sense and the characters are annoying, except for the ever charming Michael Caine. The plausibility factor was as poor as some 1950's sci-fi and less fun. Back to the Future was and is more interesting. I would have to say it was not a boring movie, but too much talking and teen angst out of adult scientists. Ann Hathaway has no place playing anyone with a PhD. The ""Dust Bowl"" effect was not terribly convincing, they could have made it seem a lot grimmer. There were too many ""that wouldn't happen"" moments for me, I couldn't suspend reality because they would keep mixing facts in and then do stuff that was pointless and unrealistic. The noise of the background was so loud often I couldn't understand the dialog, low bass organ music and rocket engine noise so loud my chair vibrated. The characters were doing things that didn't add to the story and just seemed immature, you almost couldn't root for the human race to survive."
"Review of Interstellar : I'm disappointed. Nolan failed to break out of his mold and make a truly challenging movie. This is one heck of a summer pop corn movie, I'll give it that. But it's not much more than that, and it has perhaps the worst sound design I've heard in 20 years. Nolan himself says in interviews that this is what he wanted -- really loud with dialog that's hard to hear. To make it ""more immersive"" apparently. But if I want immersive, I can go ride my pick of rides at an amusement park. What I want when I go to the theater is for the director to tell a story. And his crappy sound design gets in the way of his telling of his story. And the story is yet another variation on his favorite theme of recursion. Meh. Getting old Chris. Old. And by the end of the movie, so were the endless references to 2001. Sheesh.A good amusement park ride, yes it is. But it's still considerably below the bar set by Gravity last year."
"Review of Interstellar : I love science fiction. I love Chris Nolan films. I love creativity, genius, art, film making. I just didn't love this film.Firstly, the plot was obvious, the 'ghost' was incredibly transparent right from the moment it's mentioned for example. Michael Caine is, as always, perfectly cast but somehow feels completely overused now in a Nolan film and it showed here. I understand the need for gravitas and an A-lister but for Interstellar it has become a tired cliché. Matt Damon ? My God, it's full of (film)stars but the bonkers astronaut was done better with Sunshine. Matthew and Anne put in fine performances but the connection is lacking. And frankly, I really expected so much more than the contrived 'love and humanity' theme. When Anne waffles her way through her reasoning for a particular decision point in the film I had to do a mental 'double-take'.This film tries so hard to be a 2001: A Space Odyssey for the millennial generation and fails. Even the heavy organ soundtrack is too reminiscent of Kubrick. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be homage or a meant as a direct comparison. All it needed was a bunch of monkeys.The visuals: they're good, but they're not spectacular like everyone gushes. I think Gravity held more beauty and impact than this. The wormhole sequence, despite clinging to science and projecting an image of a 3 dimensional gateway as closely as possible was just flat.The best scenes ? You'll wish you saw more of TARS and CASE, the robots that look like 2001 monoliths miniaturised. They have the best lines.I've always paid to watch a Nolan film more than once at the cinema, in some cases 3 or 4 times because of the story, acting and visual impact. I have no inclination to do so for this film, and that has shocked me most of all."
"Review of Interstellar : Note - the last two lines sum it all up if you want to skip my blathering. Interstellar is nothing more than a sci-fi drama. If you crave sci-fi movies as I do, this film will leave you feeling unfulfilled and usurped. It is about nothing more than ""the human element"" set against a semi sci-fi backdrop that is obscenely absurd. Happy ending? Not really, and what makes it worse is that's predictable early on. Should you bother to watch this film? Yes, I watch them all, probably because curiosity gets the best of me, and who knows, you might like it. I have been disappointed, read enraged, by other films much more than this one, but it failed to impress me. Maybe if I had sat down to this one expecting to be disappointed it might have been better, but to be quite honest, the trailers make it out to be something totally different than what you get. Sad thing is, too much film marketing goes this same way these days."
"Review of Interstellar : I really don't understand what everyone's great fascination is with this movie. There are a couple of good scenes, that are funny and have the right emotional level. There are some twists, that are way too predictable or too easily brushed off. While I used to like McConahey's acting, I think he has been way too over the top with his role in this one. I liked Anne Hathaway in a few of the scenes, as well as the daughter though. Character development is basically non-existent and I was pretty bored multiple times during the movie which left me disconnected to the characters and not caring about the end of the story. I really just hoped it would end at some point.While the science behind it is truly fascinating, the movie is neither outstanding nor is the story. It has potential but is just so underdeveloped."
"Review of Interstellar : I thought this movie would be great; the plot sounded fun and intriguing, but this movie falls far short of being fleshed out. Most of the movie was slow, with a lot of quiet dialogue on very complex concepts. It was also unclear how some characters fit in ... the female astronaut is in love with who back home? Have we been introduced to this guy? Do we care? Huge jumps in storyline were glossed over: daughter Murph invented the orbiting earthlike station which saved humanity? What? And the 2001: A Space Odyssey bent near the end is overwhelmingly derivative. Overall, it seems like there must be way too much of this screenplay that fell by the wayside somewhere."
"Review of Interstellar : I was expecting a great movie especially with an all Star Cast. What ruined the movie for me were WORDS - SPEECH. Before you can enjoy a movie you must be able to understand the dialogue. I found myself and my aunt continually saying to each other ""What did he just say"". And she couldn't tell me nor could I tell her. Matthew McConaughey especially spoke to low, he seemed to mumble a lot and let his voice drop to a whisper as he was speaking. We left saying ""What just happened, what was this movie about"". I think if we could have understood everything they said we could have gotten something from the movie. Sometimes the sound effects drowned out the dialogue. The special effects were outstanding but that doesn't make a movie if you don't know what the Characters are saying. I feel like I need a refund."
"Review of Interstellar : Science Fiction works best when it sprinkles an element of actual science onto a canvas and then let's the imagination do the rest. Anything is possible right?This film however, drags you by the hair into a classroom, forcefully inserts the torn pages of science textbooks into your mouth, scribbles something ridiculous on the blackboard, urinates in the corner and then wanders out half way through muttering something dumb about love. That's all before Matt Damon turns up to ruin your day.I won't even talk about the ending...I love real science documentaries and science fiction films in equal measures. But they should not climb into bed with each other. The offspring will not be pretty as is the proof here.Honestly I really did want to like this film, on paper it would tick every one of my boxes, but I'm more concerned now for the mental well being of everyone who has rated this so highly and I really don't get the cult like following of certain film cast or directors. It is definitely life changing, but not in a good way.On the other hand, the visuals and the soundtrack are both fantastic hence the rating of 5. If we could do a people's cut of the movie with no dialogue, no acting, no plot, just shots of space and beautiful frozen alien planet landscapes, then I would give this 10 without a moments hesitation.Do watch it though and make up your own mind, but please don't say it's the best film ever made or any pukey nonsense like that."
"Review of Interstellar : I'm really sorry. I so much wanted to like this film. So much has gone into it and the concept is good, but it just didn't work for me. I found this to be a compact and fanciful story stretched up to intergalactically implausible proportions. It didn't ring true, and it was full of Hollywood formulae, like clumsy cliffhangers. And why did we have to have a Western-style fight scene on an icy planet on the other side of a black hole? There were no punches thrown in 2001.People will say it was too long but it wouldn't be any better if it was shorter. It is also an unremittingly dark and depressing film except for certain aspects. The brilliant special effects, loud sound track and music served to mask the shortcomings. On the plus side it is thought-provoking about space and physics, the actors gave everything, especially the main character, he was brilliant - it didn't have George Clooney in it a big plus. The concept is excellent, and it dramatises aspects of Einstein's theory of relativity such as meeting your children who have grown older than you.I hope a lot of people like it, as I wouldn't want all that effort and commitment to go to waste, so just ignore my opinion! Go and watch it and make up your own mind!"
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar is a movie that never gets off the ground. Based on a script that wanders from end to end attempts to comprehend its plot and themes are very difficult for the viewer. Heavily weighted with Academy Award winners including Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine and Ellen Burstyn they are never able to surmount this poorly written script. From the beginning it was obvious many elements of Interstellar were lifted from other films. These included 2001 a Space Odyssey and Enemy Mine. Promising not to giveaway details Muppets in Space was more enjoyable. Interstellar starts in a backwater town and ends on a planet 2nd rate planet. With a running time of 2 hours and 49 minutes schedule yourself at least one break. Why? Because you will be staring at your watch constantly hoping the film would tear. I rated his movie 5 out of 10 which I believe was generous. Mark Davis MD"
"Review of Interstellar : How to say it...? Pretentious sci-fi movie turned into easy-tear film. No script coherence, no science coherence and not even fiction coherence.How can anyone rate 10 points this film? How many points do they rate Blade Runner? A thousand?And it lasts for almost 3 hours. Really? Do you need 3 hours to tell this cheesy story?I can't believe that the same people that wrote Memento could write this script.So, Don't waste your money, watch any other movie instead."
"Review of Interstellar : I can understand that some you yours haven't heard about the relativity and the relation between gravity and time. But it's been +70 years that it has been proved that time is slower when things are not moving and faster when they move. Einstein explained and a countless books after him that at the light speed, objects have an infinite gravity and time is stopped. You will find many documentaries on you tube if you search... So many feels that by seeing this movie, they have discovered some hidden secret, thanks the Nolands for teaching E=Mc2 to the average American who still think that we are on Earth since Jesus. Apart from that people a crying all the time in this movie, that's too much really. The movie is slow and even if there is some tension and some surprises, it is just an average movie. The visuals are not so great, I think the Noland Brothers didn't wanted to make a 2nd Space Odyssey. The music is at the opposite of the Kubrik movie and Interstellar tries to be as realistic as possible without abusing of space wide angle. The problem is that there is a lot of empty spaces, there are only a few actors, the planets are empty. This movie does not gives you a great feeling about the conquest of space. Not so boring for 3 hours, but not so good too too. What's Noland's next movie? the UFO? The life of Jesus after he landed from Mars? The quantum physics and their relation with the time and space? Who knows..."
"Review of Interstellar : I'll go ahead and write a first objective and actually useful paragraph, instead of just giving my opinion that nobody cares about:Is this a movie for me?1. I didn't like Inception and got very confused by it.2. I loved Inception and found it very edgy.3. I didn't like Inception, I thought it was actually pretty shallow and boring and it failed to impress me. If you're in category 1, you will probably not like this movie, as this is the very same type of movie.If you're in category 2 , you watch one sci-fi movie ever 3 years or so, if your forehead wrinkles when someone utters a concept as basic in sci-fi as ""asimov laws"" (for instance), if you get easily impressed and proud when you understand a movie that category 1 doesn't, you will love Interstellar.If you're in category 3, you are more than familiar with sci-fi, whether it's movies, TV shows, literature or even video games. Avoid this movie, it will bore you out of your mind and you will get pretty annoyed by category 2 people acting like you're category 1 just because you didn't like a movie that felt challenging to them, and because they can't fathom the possibility that some people are way past this kind of movies and can't just be impressed by it.In other words, this movie was just like Inception, mediocre. And since people really have a hard time with this word, let me just explain what it means: Medi-ocre. The Latin root word medi means ""middle"".Bottomline this is an ""average"" movie for the ""average"" viewer. All the (current) 9.0 IMDb ""average rating"" does is reflecting that fact."
"Review of Interstellar : The premise here is relativity. Time vs gravity. The story, if there is one, is pointless. Christopher Nolan has surpassed Stanley Kubrick in making a visually stunning but ultimately pointless piece of Sci Fi nonsense. Nobody can give me a convincing explanation of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in 1968 it was jaw dropping. Interstellar's problem is we've seen it all before, and Nolan is not Kubrick.Perhaps there is an analogy of the futility of life here, but it's spurious at best.This ranks with Prometheus as an incredibly beautiful waste of my time."
"Review of Interstellar : This movie had such an expansive amount of hype behind it...how could anything go wrong?!(Cue the Blair Witch Project soundtrack...)By no means was this was the worst movie that I have ever seen, that's definitive; there were, however, a few things about the film that don't make much sense! Perhaps the most obvious among them was WTF was Mann trying to accomplish in his apparent death spiral desire to condemn all life on Earth?! He knew that the mathematics behind 'Plan A' was a fraud; so, he...obviously...believed that returning to Earth was no option. This means that it was his understanding that finding a planet suitable for life, from 'an Earth perspective', was the only viable option. Yet, he knew\believed that the ice planet that he landed on was not suitable for life, faking the data. So, why fake the data?? Would doing so enhance the likelihood of him being rescued? Presumably, yes, since he was transmitting the fake favorable data in hopes that someone would arrive & save him. Yet, he prevented them from doing anything on his world...obviously...because he knew they would uncover his deception. So, given that, what was the plan!? To condemn all life on Earth?! Granted, maybe that's the whole point of that story arc; he was insane. Which is, I believe, rather ironic; that 'death spiral', specifically due to the action of that scene, was, I think, the best scene in the entire film.Something overlooked by, at least, virtually everyone that saw this film, no doubt about it, is: Did the scientists on Earth see the blackhole, ""Gargantuan"", on the Earth-side of the wormhole, obviously, 'before' sending the astronauts through the wormhole, including the 12 sent through initially? It is implied that they did; but, ..& someone, please, correct me if I am wrong, ..no where throughout the first hour, or so, of the film did they bother to mention that blackhole that's on the other side of the wormhole, in that 'galaxy far, far away...' They talked about the 'wormhole'; not the blackhole! If they knew about the blackhole early enough, this, reasonably, may have changed their game-plan. Further, why go down to that planet, in orbit around the blackhole, when the risk of failure is so high, let alone actually retrieving data that is worth the risk of going down to that planet is so excruciatingly, 'astronomically' and exponentially low¿? Especially given the reality that said planet is completely inhospitable...given its close proximity to a blackhole¡!¡ For cryin' out loud, they'd be better off sending down a probe, at least at first, on the same quicker trajectory that they took to get to the planet, to determine if the data can be retrieved; & the data could reasonably be retrieved with just a probe, anyway! And if the time dilation makes all of that not viable, then, it is damn sure not worth sending people down there! It is a story arc that, in theory, sounds great 'script-wise'; because, it adds emotional turmoil for the characters to go through & experience &, therefore, tension & drama for the viewer - yet, it just doesn't honestly work. You see this as a person just watching the movie.I actually feel sorry for Getty, from ""That 70's Show""; while the character is not useless, it is a weak character, entirely because of how the character was introduced, & Topher Grace, as an accomplished actor, deserves better than that. It actually made sense for that character to be a doctor working for/at NASA/NORAD, at the compound, perhaps as the physician working directly with Professor Brand...File that under "" *Duh!* ""; seriously, put that into the '"" *Duh!* "" File'!Obviously, this was a much better way to introduce that character. And, obviously, they chose to not do this; they introduced the character in, pretty much, the worst way possible; dropping him in out of no where, like he fell out of the sky - literally, ..as an after-thought! This was an absolute hatchet job and, undeniably, is the worst thing about the entire film. And, of course, there's the gratuitously predictable 'Tom', a character as devoid of a legitimate reason to exist as any such character has ever existed in the history of cinema! I am actually surprised that they didn't make him an addict of some sort; why not just poor on the vulgar borishness like it's pancake syrup!¿?!And, finally, (astronaut) Brand had a much greater chance of getting back to ""Sol""/""Terra"", our Solar System, than Cooper 'the guy who fell into a black hole...'... But, they can't allow the hero to FAIL; so, they have them accomplish the completely impossible. And the 'Tesseract Scene' is awesome; it looks very cool. However, it only made sense in a 'goofy romanticized sort of way', i.e., 'script-wise', that Cooper was 'the ghost' who started it all... And although there may have been no truly good way, at least none that they were able to think of (Although, did they even try!?), to depict it cinematically, I would love to have seen something of the 5th Dimension beings who made it all possible. When Cooper said that 'we' were them, i.e., ""...they're not beings, they're us."", i.e., that humans are the 5th Dimension beings, that's just more romanticized BS.Overall, the worst thing about this movie is the directing, by far! This movie actually made me lose some degree of respect for Christopher Nolan."
"Review of Interstellar : If you saw ""sunshine"" and thought ""wow, good thing they had scientist advisers, this stuff is so plausible"", you will like ""interstellar"".If you saw ""armaggeddon"" and thought ""what an awesome movie, i just wished they would have dragged the scene where he says goodbye to his daughter out even more"", you will like ""interstellar"".If you saw ""inception"" and thought ""this movie would be so much better in SPACE!"", you will like ""interstellar"".And if you liked ""2001"" or any other intelligent/geeky sci-fi movie, you will hate ""interstellar"".Like some of Nolan's earlier works, it's long for the sake of length only. Its plot is up there with ""armaggeddon"" in pure stupidity and forced US-cowboy-patriot-macho-ism, its special effects are underwhelming, its plot twists are obvious, its setting makes no sense, its characters are flat and forgettable, and its constant citations of ""2001"" just serve to make you remember how much better Kubrick did all of this with a tiny fraction of the money almost 50 years back.Disappointing."
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar is mediocre. The story is chock full of cheap clichés (""Love is the 5th dimension!""), over-layered with arcane science for believability and story points that are never explained.The movie makes sense until Matt Damon. Up to that point, the quantum mechanics and astrophysics hold up, more or less. Although If you know you're going to age by 5 to 15 years on the water planet, why leave that one poor guy on his own? It's kind of heartless and that's when I started doubting the movie. But OK, fine. I can live with that.Then they head for the ice planet. And, all of a sudden, ""gravity is the force that transcends time"" and ""your mind fights death so you can see your children"".All downhill from there, way into deep space 9. The movie takes a turn for the worse: A nonsensical allegory about how humanity can be saved thanks to the power of love between a father and his daughter. It's endearing, but incomprehensible.Granted, the movie's pretty. So I gave it two stars. The actors? Love all of them. That's another 2. But I simply cannot live with a script that's nonsensical and full of stuff we're supposed to take at face-value, because it's Christopher Nolan, and he's an otherwise brilliant director: What was Michael Caine trying to not solve? What is all the research about? And, sci-fi directors: Please, drop the blackboard and chalk cliché. We technology people use computers now. Blackboards were useful when Newton was running things. Now? Not so much.It sounded like (but I'm not really sure) the five dimension bookcase, which lost me completely, was invented by humanity in a very distant future as a communications device. But then I also have to assume that that future humanity has really awesome technology if it can pull that kind of prowess. Then, why not simply invent a cellphone that can bridge time? Why not just send an email with the data component that's missing? Why would anyone have to take a chance taking a dive into a black hole to get it? And how is that future humanity saved anyway? And: How does the robot, whose location in space is never explained, come in possession of that data? And do 21st century communications really work in a black hole? Going back to the Michael Caine thing: What's the precious data component that he was missing? What does the ghost send in binary format to his daughter? (sounds to me like a lot of zeros and ones).And how does humanity get saved? Do they invent some sort of galactic Noah's ark to get people off the smoking pile of carcinogenic garbage that Earth has become? Could they not do that before? I'm sure they could.How does a human being in a space suit even survive flying into a black hole? Or maybe that's not what happened. I'm just not sure. The list goes on and on. the movie is a confusing hodge-podge of pseudo-philosophical-pseudo-scientific mess full of circular logic and loose ends. It's intended for (1) sci-fi dorks who tend to not over-think things (2) Nolan worshipers and lovers of all things shiny (3) movie ""buffs"" who enjoyed Cloud Atlas, which was more boring and more bizarre than Interstellar, but only slightly."
"Review of Interstellar : Yesterday I watched the movie ""Interstellar"". A poorly scripted and poorly directed movie with an over-simplified pseudo-science and spoon-fed philosophical implications, basically a typically overrated Hollywood movie which takes no shame in copying from 2001: A Space Odyssey from Kubrick with none of its beauty, simplicity and none of its art. It shows that in 1968 they were able to make a masterpiece and in 2014 they can't even copy it decently. The fact that on IMDb it has an higher rating than the Kubrick masterpiece makes me lose all faith in the progress of humanity and in our current generation. I will watch 2001: A space odyssey again to forget about it and restore faith in human kind again."
"Review of Interstellar : Although the idea is simple and written 100 times in SF novels and short stories, it could make a quite good space opera. It could be deep and wise. It could make people think. But no. It had to be wasted. The weakest point is not poor acting (by the way: McConaughey really can't speak? I am not the best in the world in English, but I know many native speakers who couldn't understand him talking), awful music. Even the dumbest possible design of a robot is not the worst part of the movie. It is a forced, painful solemness and pretended adherence to science and logic combined with funny, childish errors and a mile wide gaps in logic.It would take to much time and space to write down all stupid ideas, so just a few of them. Some of them are partially explained in the movie or e.g. in IMDb FAQ, but the explanations are even more naive than the goofs themselves. I start with a biggest problem: - In R. E. Raspe's ""Baron Munchausen"", the baron drowns in the mud and saves his life by pulling himself out, on his own hair. The Earthmen in the movie do the same: the humans from the future save their ancestors. But if the present people perish, there are no future people to save them... The most simple paradox, and yet they included it in the ""serious"" movie. And no naive explanations (branches, interpretations, non-linear timelines etc) can make it wiser, no matter how many times they use the word ""fractal"". And if the future people exist, they don't need to do anything, do they? - The best plan from the future humans is to put (in a past) a wormhole, 2 years flight from Earth, making it almost impossible to find and reach. Then the Earthmen would have to build spaceships for billions of people to travel to a new world. I would simply help the Earthmen get a decent crops...A catastrophic climate change destroys all the crops. How? During just several years? And all plants are dead? All animals? But humans survived? How? Isn't it possible e.g. to grow some algae in oceans? Why nobody even tries to do anything? - Why an anti-science education? A science never does any harm. Only the politics and businessmen do, using science. So it is not the science to be ostracized.A farmer drives his children to anti-science school fully equipped to bring a military drone down (has a specially programmed computer, antennas, means to establish a connection, etc.) - A ""ghost"" communication is very implausible. Does it really depend on gravity? Even some waves, oscillations would create observed effects on books/dust, the gravity hardly could.Barely legal NASA base, hidden in a barn, building a spaceship... Funny. Unsuccessfully looking for it's best pilot in the world, year after year... Funny. The pilot accidentally finds them, and is captured and interrogated like a war prisoner by scientists - funny. The scientists are pilot's old friends. And they just finished building a rocket. He has never seen this ship, he is a farmer for 20 years now, so will he fly it, the only hope for humanity, please? FUNNY! - Plan A and B. Science and technology so advanced that can keep human embryos alive during a space journey, and rise them to get humans, can not rise a radish on Earth (nor perform a MRI scan).Please, stop the stupid ""expert's presentation how it works"" (the imbecile with a pencil demonstrating wormholes, just like the similar imbecile in ""The Martian"" explaining the trivial maneuver around Earth). What makes it even more pathetic, the ""expert"" addresses his childish show to a engineer and best NASA pilot....and so on... I don't understand the physics that stands beside the unusual phenomena in the alien solar system, on its planets (the hundred miles high waves on an ocean two feet deep, the frozen, solid clouds in the air, the anti-logic movements of the ships, the anti-logic decisions of the crew... and so on...and at the end I (and all the nearby watchers) couldn't believe the stupidity of the falling to the black hole behind the main character daughter's bookshelves. It was... it was... unspoken. And the Future Men felt that the best way of communication with Present People is to shake the books in some girls' bedroom. If you can move the book, or a hand of the watch - that means, you can move objects - you can take a pen and write as well. It is the same action, using the same forces. Yes, I fully understand the meanings, metaphors, 11 dimensions of continuum, and so on. Doesn't help.To sum up: Interstellar is just another pseudoscience-fiction movie. It is intended to be deep and serious, but is just funny (including it's makers argumentation why it is not). It is not easy to think out a GOOD SF story. You can easily make a non-science fiction story which is very good and nice to read or watch (like Star Wars), but it cannot pretend it is serious and science-based. The most depressing thing about that movie is, however, it's huge overrating on IMDb. Are the young people so easy to control? If they see something that makes the first impression of having some value (slow, grave, pseudo-intellectual) they give 9 and 10 points just to show they are serious and deep-thinking? Is that why poor SF movies get such a high notes? Passengers, the last few Aliens and so on?My ""4"" rating is a real one, not lowered to balance the general overrating."
"Review of Interstellar : With a great deal of effort I managed to watch this movie in its entirety. That was because the storyline was peculiar enough for me to say - I need to see how the film is going to (hopefully) tie-together. Thus that positive brought my rating up to a 4. On the negative-side:1) this movie is 2.5 hr of tedious lack-of-action. 2) most dialogue is mumbled - sounding like a new foreign language, or low in volume. 3) Those dialogue issues thus made it near impossible to follow the complex plot ""reveals"". 4) The special effects were not 2014-quality. The spaceship shots reminded me of circa-1980's Battlestar Galactica. 5) Plot problem: the pilot (MM) is enlisted to fly the spaceship because he was a great pilot many years ago. The next thing you know he's at the controls of a very complex spaceship that he has never seen. I guess if the writer suggested that the pilot went thru months of training', would have just dulled this movie further. It would be like Rocky fighting Apollo Creed, without showing the side-of-beef being hit, and running the City Hall steps.Anyway this is not a great movie in any sense. A story that tries to play on the themes of : 1) Love overcomes all, and 2) a father's love for his family can overcome the physics of the universe, are just predictable emotional-appeals (of the writer/producer) - trying to salvage something at the box-office, from the audience being left with a ""feel-good"".A great story + being well executed + an emotional-appeal = an 8 to 10 rating. This movie is just a lifeless, jumbled bore."
"Review of Interstellar : I'm trough with Nolan since Inception, and this one just hammers all the flaws that were made obvious since the latter.Stylish cinematography and shootyshooty bang bang scenes don't equate to what I'd call a good movie.Starts off pretty good, with a fascinating concept.But Nolan's just good at inventing interesting premises and serving them with -merely- interesting cinematography, and that's about it.He's terrible at dialogues and characters, he's soul-less, boring, robotic, and systematically shoots himself in the foot with high brow concepts he can't develop properly.All of his ""groundbreaking"" ideas always boil down to lacklustre gimmicks, and his movies end up as generic action flicks that barely stand up to turds such as ""die another day"".Inception was derivative as hell, this one was just plain boring and cringy all the way (Hathaway and McConaughey are doing their usual thing : playing as themselves and being beyond obnoxious and annoying), Michael Cane just plays every Michael Cane part in every CN movies, Matt Damon is barely there, the script is bad, the dialogues are snoozy and ridiculous, the ending is an atrocious naive mess (LOVE IS THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAAAGE gimme a break, seriously).Nolan's last 4 movies are utter garbage, and Tenet is by far the worst.I really liked memento. I thought Dark Knight was ok for an immature comic book flick.Objectively, Nolan isn't a good director, he's superficial, only good at visuals, pretentious, and overall boring and self-absorbed. He couldn't write a decent story or interesting characters to save his life, he's about as emotionally gifted as a broken toaster.Really glad that people are finally realizing that Nolan is a one trick pony with Tenet.I think it's high time people acknowledge how mediocre of a director Nolan is.Go shoot music videos and ads Chris, movies just aren't your thing."
"Review of Interstellar : Let me preface this by stating that I am a big Christopher Nolan fan. Following the success of his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, plus standalone movies ""Inception"" and ""The Prestige"", we have something of a one-man franchise. Warner Bros signed off on the biggest pre-approved budget in movie history to make ""Interstellar"" without even seeing a script.Going into the movie, I knew that with this kind of creative freedom, there were always going to be a couple of self-indulgent bits and perhaps a few ideas and sequences that the producers would have viciously vetoed with a less powerful director at the helm. But I didn't mind. In today's remake and reboot happy Hollywood, I sat back to enjoy what might be the last movie in a quite a while with an A-list director, completely original story, and a money-no-object budget.Which is why I'm sorry to report that this movie just didn't work for me at all. The problem is that it's not really a movie. It's about three different kinds of movie mixed together, into one very complex but rather indigestible dish. This same approach worked for ""The Dark Knight"", where Nolan threw everything but the kitchen sink into the screenplay and somehow made it all work. Unfortunately, lightning hasn't struck twice for Interstellar. Nolan's intergalactic juggernaut struggles to get off the ground, and when it's finally up there, doesn't really know what to do with itself. Sort of similar to the real space programme.The film opens fairly slowly, mostly in a dusty Midwestern farming community. No problem, in theory - ""Star Wars"" and ""Superman"" both openedlike this, and both were great movies. Then lots of talking heads pop up, like in a documentary. Then, they vanish, and we find ourselves in the middle of what feels like a Depression-era movie with a single father struggling to raise two wayward children on his own.We get a little background on this dystopian world. Big food shortages have created wars, crises, and the government can't afford frivolities such as a space program. Apparently, the Earth is dying, with the atmosphere rapidly becoming unbreathable. Also, there is a drone aircraft flying around - from India, of all places.Then, a ghost, which is actually gravity, communicates with Cooper's daughter by speaking to her by arranging books into barcodes and tells them to go to a secret (fully funded and operational) NASA base which has been hidden from society for decades behind a wire fence in a cornfield. I guess that must be some wire. Space wire. NASA wire.If none of this sounds like it makes any sense, it's because it doesn't. Without a clear direction, Interstellar falls apart. It continues to throw the most disjointed, jarring plot elements lifted from every epoch of space movie our way for the next two and a half hours in what could loosely be called a 'story'. There are bits that feel like ""Gravity"" with super-realistic spaceflight sequences. There are bits that feel like 1960s Star Trek where the famously doomed ""redshirts"" are sent down to random planets to die in slightly comical accidents. If you're detecting a bit of a clash of tone here, then congratulations: Nolan didn't. The unexpectedly mad, undisciplined screenplay continues to ricochet around until the very end, which plays like a cross between ""Inception"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" It's not just the plot which has developed mild schizophrenia either: the feeling extends to the characters. Brand (Anne Hathaway) is introduced as a scientific, hard-nosed foil to Coopers' wild, seat-of- the pants pilot. The movie has a nasty habit of forgetting about her, and she wanders in and out of proceedings to no avail. Then it's revealed that she's in love with an offscreen character who we have never met.All throughout this, we are flicking back and forth between equally weird and random plot developments on Earth. Cooper has left a son and daughter behind. We spend quite a lot of time with the younger daughter (Mackenzie Foy) but then she grows up, becomes a quantum physicist - not bad for a farm hand - and is basically a completely different character, which means all the time the movie spent on the young version is ultimately wasted. Cooper seems to completely forget he has a son as well - we only see him pining for the daughter.It's very important for a film to do is establish its tone and what kind of movie it is within its first ten minutes. Interstellar couldn't do this for two hours. It could have ended in a musical number and it wouldn't have made any more or less sense.I also found myself wondering what they managed to spend the enormous budget on. Take away the A-list actors and there's no reason that this couldn't have been done for $30m. Some of the effects (example: when Mann tries to dock with the Endurance) are actually pretty flimsy. They didn't look or move like real spacecraft at all.For me, the ultimate irony with Insterstellar is that it had two or three ideas which could have been developed into good movies on their own: for example, the idea of an former astronaut having to convince skeptical authorities on an impoverished future Earth that their only chance of survival is a wildly risky space expedition. For better or worse, there is no way Inception would ever have been made without Nolan's involvement. This is the great two-edged sword of creative freedom. I just hope Nolan doesn't become the last ever director to wield it."
"Review of Interstellar : Attention: there might be spoilers here, but otherwise it is just not possible to discuss the film, IMHO. So do not read further if you have not seen it yet. Actually it is the first Nolan film I see, and I am open-mouthed at the HUGE hype preceding it. The film does not fulfill the expectations in most ways. The worst is the insufferable dialogue, which forces good actors into ineptness, Matt Damon being a particularly sad example. The whole screenplay needed about twenty (thousand) revisions more. There are characters that are completely superfluous, so much that one gets killed without any repercussions in the plot at all. And they do not seem to have a use for the character Romilly, either, except getting older. The idea of the NASA chief being a villain is preposterous; why send people on a mission you know they are going to fail? And his own daughter? Since it is all secret, which gallery would he be playing to? (and mind you, Caine is one of the very very few convincing characters, the other ones being Ellen Burstyin and the robots). There are huge scientific errors too, in spite of Kip Thorne. To slow time so much in the water planet, the gravity would have to crush the astronauts in essentially the first instant. A solution would have been to have the planet (or the ship) move nearer the speed of light, but apparently nobody thought of that. Points are about as subtle as a kick in the stomach, and I fail to see why anybody would think the science is ""dense"" and the film is ""complex"". Special effects are good. of course, but not as much as the hype says. And, sorry, if you get near a black hole, you would be thinned out like spaghetti by the enormous gravity. It is just impossible not only to survive, but to get out. The ""They"" is just a ""Deus ex machina"" to save the main plot from its own inepcy, and since this is all supposed to be so scientific, their appearance in the plot is completely arbitrary and illogical. And what, pray, would be these ""quantum data""? Since the quantic theory applies only in extremely small dimensions, why go look for it in space?. Somebody thought it sounded cute, I guess. There was no need to be realistic and scientific if we are getting out of the mire by miracle. The ending is maybe the best part, at times moving, but the notion that somebody who has been in hospital and will be let out only in ""a couple of days"" can rush to a rocket and take off, without space suit, raining, or assistance, as if it was a bicycle, seems ridiculous. My first and last Nolan film, I suspect."
"Review of Interstellar : I believe that once people get on the band wagon they follow the hype of this move, hence the mega score of 9.5. I think Chris Nolan wanted to enter himself in the realms of Stanley 2001.I wont bore myself or anyone else, my major issues, 1. Why use Saturn rocket to launch out of earth when they had these cool ships in the rest of the movie to fly up and down from planets.2:They can go through worm holes, find earth like planets but cant detect its a frozen rock and the other has no land at all.3.If he could send a message to say STAY, why would he then have sent the co ordinates to NASA headquarters, why send anything at all.4.MATT DAMON, didn't fit role."
"Review of Interstellar : This movie is everything I expected it not to be. It was dramatic, but not in a good way. Over dramatic. Far, far too predictable, too Hollywood and anything, and I mean anything but scientific. I'm just going to ask this once - Chris,have you ever actually read any Stephen Hawking? Because then maybe the story line could have taken a turn toward science instead of fairy tale, Hollywood pump up the revenue box office production. Maybe someone on your crew could have consulted with Hawking and came up with an alternate ending. One where people who enter black holes get broken up into their atomic parts such as happens to even light. Instead of some fantasy land Disney ride. Wow what garbage.The trailer in this movie made it look like an amazing adventure in deep space. And yes, don't get me wrong there is space, and a few time deadlines to add in some much needed suspense after one too many porch scenes with Grandpa drinking beer while tending the corn fields. However, what this movie lacked was a sense of logic. I mean really. Flat out.The blight that is taking down the humans seems to be completely overlooked in the movie. There really is no information on it except, our atmosphere has a lot of nitrogen in it which is feeding the blight. ""huh?"" The earth is written off in this movie because of blight? This earth has survived, earthquakes, giant meteorites, plagues, famines, flooding and we are done in by a blight?Fine, we can't feed people so we are headed for the stars, all covertly of course. And our hero just happens to stumble upon NASA. Which wants him to be the pilot, even though he's a reluctant farmer, who was a pilot - because as a pilot he's the best of the best with honors. The script felt like something I would read in an old spaghetti western Clint Eastwood movie. I feel like I threw money away on a cheap plot based on oversimplification of scientific notions and box office greed. And the end: omg it's ""time,"" no, no it's ""gravity,"" no it's time. Just stop. And our protagonist surviving a black hole. What? Because it's not a black hole? Human's built it? Future humans. Probably the one's from Futurama. OK I've seen enough roll credits. However, that said, if you want some good sound, yes the sound was good. Good visuals, nothing gravity didn't do better, and descent acting, almost like Armageddon, yah know, the Bruce Willis stuff. Then indeed this is your movie. Trust me, this is no Inception. If you go, enjoy, just don't go in with high expectations (9.1 on IMDb? really?)or you'll be let down.Oh and the 2001 monolith robots were the highlight of the movie for me. They were good for a couple of laughs. Have a good one."
"Review of Interstellar : I was ready to like this film, given his work on The Dark Knight, Memento and Inception. Of course, I was worried about the casting - McConaughey doesn't belong in an intelligent sci-fi, and Hathaway should only appear in movies doing a bad English accent in a lush period drama, but I was hoping for he best.SO we get McConaughey mumbling for literally the first hour, during the course of which almost nothing at all happens. It's so bad you have to turn the sound up. And then of course we meet Hathaway, who is to acting what Genghis Khan was to community relations. And then, implausibly, we see them sent up in a rocket to save the planet, which is followed by some nice visuals and ludicrous plotting before the end which is almost as bad as Bobby Ewing waking up in a shower. SO it was predictable, absurd, and poorly acted which leads to the question why are people falling over themselves to say how great it is? I suspect it's because McConaghey is the man of the moment, and Nolan considered a genius. Which people think mean they can do no wrong.Which is a disappointing conclusion to reach."
"Review of Interstellar : My wife and I love Sci-fi and have been anticipating this movie for months! When we saw the 9.3 review (that's what it is now anyway) we were even more excited. So, off we went to the theater last night ready to be blown away.We almost left the movie, which would be a first.OK, the special effects are great, but the sniveling factor we couldn't stomach. I'm mean seriously, there was someone bawling on the screen nearly 50% of the movie. Many of the lines were so cheesy we look at each other like, ""can you believe this?"" If you like sad drama's, depressing story lines and crying astronauts give it a go. This falls under SciFi, but it really should fall under drama. Ugh, I'm trying to forget it."
"Review of Interstellar : The movie delivers some remarkable achievements in cinematography but it cannot be saved. It's naive, boring, silly, tearful and brings the irksome feeling that a decent filming and acting were wasted on a messy story that can be digested only if one leaves aside all their critical thinking. I'm still wondering what is the big flaw of the storyline: is it the fact that it's made out of air, so thin that it resembles vacuum, or is it the super-fast delivery of the space-time-anomaly-behind-the-library explanation of the whole point, right after the ridiculous safe-exit-from-a-spacecraft-inside-a-black-hole drama.Given the overall score here and the reaction of people around me, this movie is a paradox... It provokes contrasting opinions, so inexplicable to the opponent, that it reminds me of #thedress."
"Review of Interstellar : Overall, ""Interstellar"" was an underwhelming experience for me.The film spent too much time establishing characters and relationships that in the end just felt unconvincing and contrived.It was full of wooden dialogue. The parts in which the scientists dropped basic astrophysical knowledge in a Wikipedia-like diction were cringeworthy.The conclusions to which they jumped (aliens put the wormhole there to save the human race, love has to be the fifth dimension) rendered these characters completely unbelievable to me.The turn of events by which Cooper came to be the chosen pilot of the spacecraft, that was probably the most painfully impotent writing I have ever seen in a large budget movie.The film completely failed to show the space pioneers having any sense of awe in light of the incredible things they were witnessing. When Cooper was told about the existence of a wormhole near Saturn and the habitable planets on the other side, he took it like a boring lecture and the most obvious thing ever. This grotesquely ignorant attitude was visible throughout the whole movie. Characters only ever showed care and concern for their own families or abstract concepts like ""the human race"". I found this totally anthropocentric perspective not credible at all and highly unlikeable.However, when the spacecraft passed Saturn, it was beautiful to look at. The spheric wormhole was simply breathtaking. Although the scene was way too short, it was one of the best.The black hole and its center was also quite good.Visually, the film lacked imagination and scope in every other aspect. Most of the space scenes consisted of unexciting chamber shots inside the spacecraft. The beauty and wonder of the foreign planets wasn't explored at all. Besides a very cool tidal wave, the most exciting thing happening there was a stupid brawl between two astronauts on a rocky surface.There was also a risky docking maneuver in space that was thrilling, but depressing nonetheless. When a standard action beat such as a docking maneuver is the most exciting scene in a film about intergalactic space travel, you know the scriptwriter did something wrong.The scene where Cooper meets his daughter as an old woman was very touching and well executed. It reminded me of one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes, ""The Long Morrow"".In my opinion, the film suffered from a weak screenplay and little imagination."
"Review of Interstellar : Imagine a remake of 2001: A Space Odyssey but produced by Oprah and directed by Dr. Phil - featuring some the most unprofessional, sappy, cry baby astronauts ever put on film. That pretty much describes Interstellar. It will make true science fiction fans nostalgic for the cool precision of Stanley Kubrick.A great premise, fascinating science and some of the grandest shots of space travel ever committed to film go to waste, buried deep between two soggy galactic tampons. A frustrating experience, as so much greatness was just below the surface. Oh well.Still worth seeing, at least as a rental, for the aforementioned visual design. In that sense, the movie has a lot in common with Prometheus - another visual masterpiece of science fiction compromised by a bad screenplay and silly choices."
"Review of Interstellar : When I first heard of the making of this film, I had reservations about it. Then, I learned that a well-known scientist(Kip Thorne) was attached to it as a technical consultant and my interest began to increase. Getting it right, scientifically, seldom works with the film industry, although there have been limited occasions where it has. Avatar, Kubrick's classic 2001 back in 1968, and one even further back, Forbidden Planet (1956) show that it can be done.With this in mind, I thought this might be one of those rare ones that could live up to my expectations. I mean, after all, Christopher Nolan and Thorne. How could it fail. I've always believed that, in order to make a quality science fiction film, you have to have a writer that knows what the genre is all about. In this case, there is not only the potential for quality writing from Nolan but also scientific expertise from one of the top scientist in the field - what could go wrong...go wrong.... Well, in spite of all that, it did just that.Yes, it was a visual treat that applied all the wonderful effects developed over the years. And it did that very well. But that's not enough anymore; at least not for me.What I experienced instead was story that was based on a premise that was faulty almost from the start with scientific shortcomings and implausible circumstances. And that's where the disappointment comes in for me. I can understand Nolan's possible lack of detailed knowledge of wormholes, time dilation, gravity effects, and the like, but how could a respected scientist like Thorne allow it? Unless of course he had little control over the film's production. Alas, that is probably the case.I'm not going into any detail about the the actual story because that is already well documented in other reviews. I end with a final summary and opinion: If you know little about that actual scientific aspects of the various theories touched upon in this film, you'll probably find it entertaining. If, on the other hand, you have sufficient knowledge of what we humans actually know of such things; you too, may be a bit disappointed."
"Review of Interstellar : Christopher Nolan seems to draw a buzzing mass of Nolan-fanatics wherever he goes. These little buzzers swarm around The Light That Is Nolan and in His light, nothing can ever go wrong. Who cares if Bane's death in The Dark Knight Rises was ridiculous? It's Nolan, he's amazing, God sent his cute little pout to earth to bless our sorry asses, and have you seen his (Aaaaand here we wander into dangerous territory.)Okay I get it, Memento was ingenious, The Dark Knight set new standards for the superhero-scope of the cinema-verse, but Nolan sure doesn't have the Midas hand of movie-making. He's a man, he makes mistakes, and not all of the stuff he makes turns out so fabulous.Hence the reason for the lame pun of this post: Nolan's latest film, Interstellar, wasn't as stellar as the name suggests.Sure, Interstellar has fancy technology, as its Oscar for Best Visual Effects will demonstrate. The most accurate portrayal of a wormhole, precision of orbital physics and astrophysics, (insert fancy jargon here)All that's great, except that there's more to a movie than just technical splendor.Stanley Kubrick's science fiction masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't considered one of the greatest sci-fi films ever created only for its revolutionary techniques in portraying space and spaceships; its profound ruminations of the nature of man and the questions it raises on the divide between natural and artificial intelligence are what has put the film on the pinnacle of cinema. Of course, the movie's amazing sequences of spaceships moving slowly in harmony with Strauss's majestic pieces cannot be overlooked, but that does not mean they are the sole reason behind A Space Odyssey's critical acclaim.Interstellar tries valiantly to mimic both the technical and philosophical marvels of historical sci-fi films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, yet it fails by a long shot in delivering a significant, poignant message. The early scenes between Murph and Cooper fall flat in emotion; neither the acting nor the dialog carry through the fragile emotions that should have been exchanged in such a scene. Nolan's efforts to raise questions on the ""human identity"" are easily spotted in scenes that seem almost forced, with little contextual connection to the sequence of events that move the story forward. The best example would be Anne Hathaway's excruciatingly cringe-worthy scene in which she claims love is worth jeopardizing their whole mission and the future of humanity for. Seriously, this comes out of nowhere—when did Hathaway's character become so irrational and obsessed with her probably long-dead lover?""Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space,"" she cries. Sound like something from one of those turn-your-life-around-through-these-10-steps books? It's unbelievably sloppy and unrealistic dialogue, and something I'm not at all surprised to find in a Nolan movie. Self-important, philosophic textbook quotes may work in a superhero movie where the hero is expected to be somewhat presumptuous, but not so much for a supposedly realistic science fiction flick.What I've concluded is that Interstellar is neither unique nor special; its ideas of travel through wormholes and warped time in different areas of the galaxy have already been entertained in science fiction films of an earlier age such as Star Trek. The only factor that Interstellar can show off above all other is the accuracy to which it incorporated modern theories of space and time— the wormhole's curved surface is supposedly the most accurate representation of such a thing ever put on screen.Perhaps the supposed scientific genius of the movie becomes more real to its audience because of the background of the movie, or the way the subject of space travel is treated. Science fiction movies like Star Trek seem far off from reality—such movies portray themselves as fiction, a made up world, a world that is usually beyond the parameters of a ""what if"" world that diverges from our own. Interstellar, however, tries to make itself seem like an extension of the reality we live in—our future very well may have in store for us a dry, bleak land that has forsaken the human race. Dying potato fields and giant dust storm seem less childlike, less like a figment of our imagination than do light sabers and evil warlords waging war on the galaxy. We are led to empathize with the world of Interstellar as if it were our own and not a created fantasy land, which is why some of the things that happen in the movie seem less absurd than what happens in other films of the same genre (of course, these ""things"" exclude the infamous bookshelf and Morse code scene, the absolute bane of the movie and the epitome of Christopher Nolan's over-ambition with his newest project).So if you thought Interstellar was an absolute blast, good for you. Congratulations for spending those extra dollars on watching IMAX 3D or whatever it is they have these days. Next time though, you might want to consider crashing on your couch with a nice, homemade bowl of buttery popcorn and let Netflix lead you through the world of true, time-proved science fiction. (Of course, Interstellar re-runs are always available. Respect personal preference I must.)"
"Review of Interstellar : Writing reviews is not my profession or purpose..i prefer to enjoy a movie than to criticize it.. its my second time here after snowpiercer...but i had to write again because its pretty obvious, that some movies are patronised for some reasons although they don't worth it..interstellar is at this category...u know, i m a big fan of sci-fi movie, novels, books, theories of all kind..my entire life is dedicated in searching for answers ...i have watched ridiculous movies , low badget productions or with childish scenarios and i didn't mind, i always find a good spot in any movie..because i have a thurst to solve some of the mysteries that surround us..so , after all the promotion about this movie, i was looking forward to watch it..i thought it would be spectacular ..the promises were fine, the director famous, the actors, the plot...well , i was so wrong!!! first time in my life i slept during a movie...the beginning was awful...the plot was childish and impossible ...the scientific explanations ridiculous..the acting was pseudodramatic and weak..the philosophical and poetical references not convincing, the music terrible... at least i was expected, to see some spectacular special effects in space , in planets...instead , i was watching the side and the wings of the spacecraft and 2 empty planets with no interest...i am still disappointed and angry,cos i was expected a spectacular movie, and instead i watched crap..if a sci-fi movie manages to make me sleep, the biggest fan of sci-fi, its crap...if i have to send an advice to all of u, is this one..don't believe the reviews here and elsewhere with enthusiastic words or votes from 9-10..the movie is below 5 and very weak...in comparison with CONTACT, is like day with night...PROMETHEUS was a masterpiece compare to this, even all the ALIEN series , all the TERMINATOR series, the 2 TOTAL RECALL films, and even even LOST IN SPACE..i do not recommend this film to any sci-fi lover..thanks"
"Review of Interstellar : A couple years ago, there was a major motion picture called ""Cloud Atlas."" Never heard of it? That's because it bombed. It was a three-hour marathon of six non-intertwining stories, one of which held my interest. The least interesting depicted a futuristic world of cannibalism and idol-worship on the big island of Hawaii. I wrote at the time that Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are so bad in this story they seem like amateurs. The dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. I couldn't believe Warner Brothers had actually green-lighted this project.Now I've seen something similar. Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is a three-hour convoluted mess of science fiction, with a potentially interesting story buried somewhere deep inside the dialogue. To wit, in the future, the world is approaching the end of its habitability. I don't know why. It has something to do with crop blight, but if the explanation was in the script, I must have missed it. NASA has developed a secret plan to explore other potentially viable planets. Impossible, you say? Ah, but there is a ""wormhole"" near Saturn, which allows astronauts to explore five promising alternatives for the salvation of humanity. (A wormhole is a theoretical means of quickly traveling through space and time, based on Einstein's theory of relativity. Think of it like Han Solo traveling at warp speed, only it's supposed to sound more plausible.) I'm not sure anyone ever explained why all five planets were able to appear in the same place at the same time, when in reality, they must have been light-years apart from one another.The always-reliable Matthew McConaughey plays NASA pilot Cooper, and Anne Hathaway is Amelia, a scientist also aboard the rocket ship. In the best decision writers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan made, no romance is ever suggested between the two leads. I only wish they had done a better job of explaining what ""Interstellar"" is all about.After landing on one of the planets, Cooper and Amelia meet up with another scientist, Dr. Mann, played by Matt Damon, who was stranded on a previous mission. In the strangest plot twist, Dr. Mann tries to kill Cooper for some unexplained reason. Up until this point, I believed I could suspend my disbelief enough to recommend ""Interstellar."" But why wouldn't two NASA employs be able to work together? Is it because Nolan wanted Dr. Mann's shuttle to explode while attempting to dock with the rocket? Could be. Unlike last year's excellent ""Gravity,"" ""Interstellar"" is a loud, busy picture, overstuffed with special effects, unnecessary music, and screaming characters.Eventually, Cooper and Amelia venture into a black hole (yes, on purpose; don't ask why) where time appears spatially, allowing Cooper to visit his daughter in her childhood and warn her to lead humanity to explore other worlds. Ironically, we see this warning at the beginning of the film, before the voyage even begins. It doesn't make sense then, but for my money, it never makes sense at the end of the picture either. Somehow, Cooper doesn't age, yet his young daughter appears as an old woman at the end. Again, it has something to do with Einstein's Theory of Relativity – and therein lay the problem: Nobody understands the Theory of Relativity! All the longwinded scientific explanation of the cast (which eats up most of the dialogue) sounds like a bunch of existential mubmo-jumbo from the original ""Star Trek"" series. It's impossible to follow, due to its complexity, yet it's impossible to suspend disbelief, because the plot is so outlandish. Coming on the heels of Alfonso Cuaron's far superior ""Gravity"" last year, ""Interstellar"" pales in comparison. Much as Stanley Kubrick did in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" Cuaron managed to nail the silence of outer space. ""Gravity"" was a quiet, reserved film, which highlighted the loneliness of space travel. ""Interstellar"" is blaring and assiduous – like a semi-serious ""Star Wars"" crossed with the garbage science of ""Star Trek."" ""Interstellar"" is an old-fashioned Saturday matinée, revved up past power ten with top-notch actors, IMAX special effects, and a music score that just won't stop. ""Interstellar"" is so big and expensive, it was financed by both Paramount and Warner Brothers. It's movie-making on a grand scale. And at that level, it fails. It might have worked, had it simply been stripped down a notch or two. And it's probably just me, but I have a problem with the name. Why would anyone choose an adjective as the name of a movie? Interstellar what? Where's the evasive noun? Probably sitting on the cutting-room floor with Einstein's Theory of Relativity."
"Review of Interstellar : I'm actually really angry right now, a few people recommended this film to me and i just don't understand why?! Maybe i'm just not that smart. I barely understood it and most of it went over my head. I pretty much relied on the synopsis to understand what was going on, and if a film is that hard for me to follow, then it obviously just isn't for me. I can't fault the visuals, music or the majority of the acting - just the story, and in particular the turn it took at the end...what was that? why? there was no need! I was bored at the start. Then the film peaked my interest once they were in space and then the turn it took just made me fed up and annoyed. I don't seem to love Christopher Nolan as much as everyone else does, i enjoyed his earlier films and two of the Batman films but most of his films just end up boring me. It's disappointing because i usually always love his casting choices and i want to like his films but most of them just don't engage me. Maybe he just isn't for me. Jon enjoyed this more than me and gave it 7/10 but even he admitted that he didn't understand the majority of it and he also enlisted the help of the synopsis. I guess if you haven't watched it give it a go, you may enjoy it or like me you might wish that you'd spent the past three hours doing something else..."
"Review of Interstellar : Christopher Nolan once again gives more than enough evidence that he is the most overrated director in modern Hollywood. How is it possible to have such a premise (interstellar voyage to save human race) and make such a boring movie? It beats me, but what puzzles me even more is how it is possible to make a movie with almost no character at all. What is this movie about? It's not about an interstellar voyage, that's for sure. It ain't about discoveries, either. (imagine a group of explorers who are some of the first people to land on another planet and they are excited as my 90+ year-old grandmother is when she cooks dinner) It ain't about aliens either. It ain't about saving humanity either, there is hardly any people shown except for one village somewhere in USA. Can you really tell a story that big by wrapping it around just a few people? In theory you can and it could actually work if it made any sense. But to end the movie they it was done here, by placing a portal inside a black hole which is designed to connect only two specific people, two specific people who have accidentally found NASA's basement top-secret James Bond project - it is beyond me. Once Cooper started texting his daughter in Morse code through this portal I felt embarrassed. I felt embarrassed for Nolan brothers. That's it? That was the grand idea which connects the loose ends and saves humanity? I wish Matt Damon had killed them all, it would have been more interesting and much more plausible than this mess. His anger actually makes sense, who wouldn't be frustrated with a plot like this? I believe a big portion of estimated 165 million dollar budget went into paid reviews here on IMDb."
"Review of Interstellar : American pathetic social conditioning about ""American Families"" again. Everyone is emotional, crying, love each other and bonds are tight. I want to puke!"
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar is a visually stunning film containing the most realistic depictions of astronomical objects such as wormholes and black holes ever shown in a film, through in- depth input from Professor Kip Thorne. Most of the acting performances are very strong, and the set design of the spaceships and alien planets are great. For those reasons alone it's worth a look, but there are some problems. Before I get into spoilers, one of the main issues is pace. The film is just too long, and in particular it takes an age to get off Earth and into space. We came here for Sci-fi, the film's called Interstellar, c'mon, how about some rockets 'n stuff? It also feels too long because the film is a checklist of every major astronomical concept ever filmed - black holes, neutron stars, wormholes, time dilation and more besides. Some simplification would have made for a better story.From here on there are spoilers.The entire plot is based on an obvious causality paradox. Matthew McConaughey's character is an astronaut turned farmer who is given the coordinates of a secret NASA base by a future version of himself, enabling him to travel to the base and be accepted into the NASA team. Only the fact that he found the base enabled him to travel into space and ultimately send this message back to his earlier self.That's not the only problem with the plot by a long way, though. While engaged in a race to save humanity, the characters waste 23 years traveling to a planet orbiting a black hole, where the theory of relativity states time is passing much more slowly. The purpose of the trip is to establish whether the planet is a suitable replacement Earth for humanity. At no point do they attempt to assess the planet from orbit (where all of it could be seen, without losing 23 years of Earth-time) but must instead visit the surface (presumably to see what a couple of square miles looks like). This ends in the death of one astronaut and the finding that the planet is no good. It's as if none of the characters have noticed that they are in a spaceship literally covered in windows. Also, the beacon saying ""everything's great here"" that they went to investigate turned out to be just a series of echoes of the initial signal it sent before being destroyed. So they were unable to predict that possibility despite clearly having a full understanding of relativistic physics, and their beacons aren't programmed to include a time stamp or any form of ID number. People this stupid deserve everything they get...At the next planet they discover that the earlier human explorer sent there (don't worry, the script includes a ridiculous explanation of why a dozen astronauts were sent to their near- certain deaths rather than using unmanned probes) turns out to be falsely sending out ""come visit, it's good here"" signals because he wants to be rescued. So the mission was designed in complete ignorance of the human instinct for self-preservation and how that could ruin everything. People this stupid deserve everything they get...In a movie that markets itself on how good and realistic its science is, we are put through some cringe making dialogue about how love is quantifiable, conquers all and will save us in the end. Anakin and Padme made me want to vomit less than that scene.Towards the end, the lead character falls into a black hole in an act of self-sacrifice. Then there are a few obvious winks to the audience designed to hint that nobody really knows what laws of physics apply inside a black hole, and then it turns out that inside black holes the last ten minutes of 2001 A Space Odyssey are being endlessly ripped off for all eternity, except with more deus ex machina. The small problem with this is that the lead character would be dead long before he got inside the Event Horizon, so...And after that, the black hole spits him out in some new, unexplained, convenient way to a region of space that just happens to be a short hop away from a space station where he can be rescued in time to meet his now-elderly daughter who saved humanity by building space stations that in no way rely on his heroic actions. And when he gets there to meet the daughter he left aged 10, who now has children and grandchildren of her own while he has not aged a year, none of them are interested, and she sends him away. The last ten minutes of the film are both redundant and stupid.All in all, Interstellar is a beautiful, well acted, engaging, interesting film let down by a plot so weak you'll feel like you're watching a moron's idea of an intelligent movie."
"Review of Interstellar : I sent to see Interstellar on Saturday night and have just spent 45 incredulous minutes reading the reviews. The film I went to see was dull, preposterous and far far far too long. Let's start with the idea. A good one but poorly displayed. I wanted to know more about how humanity was destroying the planet. All I got was old folk I am guessing talking about the duststorms of the 1920's and 1930's? Perhaps they were attempting to lay the foundation for the whole premise of the film? I also wanted to know more about Cooper but we didn't really see how he became a farmer other than the flashback at the start. When did his wife die? Why is his father in law living with him? Did we really get to understand the relevance of the droid they chased in the truck? Unfortunately most of the film is taken up with barely audible dialogue about scientific hypothesis and personal issues intertwined together. This made it very difficult to follow and the interest wanes as a result. BUT the biggest downfall of the film is Matt Damon. I am a fan off his but not in this. He is dreadfully miscast as the villain of the piece of sorts and that whole fight with Cooper and Ryan is poor. It is just not convincing at all and there is no suspense involved in the whole docking scene at all. Cooper just tells him not to dock as he hasn't got the codes but you never felt Ryan was in jeopardy. It was so poorly constructed. Overall vey similar to Inception in that it is at times visually stunning but rather like Inception it is style over substance. Beautiful to look at but like opening a strawberry cream in a box of Quality Street - very disappointing. And the title of my review? I am just a bit fed up that Nolan has made some fine early films and now nobody will criticise him? In The Emperors New Clothes nobody tells the Emperor he is wearing nothing until a little boy informs him. Somebody needs to tell Nolan that he needs to get back to crafting films full of suspense and not a plodding sci-fi full of characters you barely care about."
"Review of Interstellar : This film is 2 hours and 49 minutes of slowly bleeding to death. The magnitude of actors is the only one thing that keeps my attention (e.g. when is Matt Damon inserted into this?). Such a disappointment. I'm very pleased that I waited until this was available on streaming services.The beginning, while slow and lacking character development (and somewhat unbelievable), is interesting. The end is completely ridiculous. I had a flashback to ""The Fifth Element"" where it was declared that love was the 5th element. Too much time spent on irrelevant side stories that added nothing. The ending is difficult to find realistic or plausible. I found myself wondering how this movie could have such high ratings on IMDb after being released over 1 year ago!As a scientist/engineer, I wanted to enjoy this film. I was woefully disappointed.For anyone interested, I'd watch The Martian long before watching this drivel. I'm shocked that this is #29 in IMDb's ""Top Rated Movies"", how did that happen?Brings into question how reliable IMDb really is with respect to objective movie reviews."
"Review of Interstellar : A lot of mistaken pop science and poor attention to details makes this film a dumbing experience. Films based in history, biography and science need both the writers and viewers to do the hard work of reading the appropriate research so that we are bettered by the film experience. Director's/producers need to pay attention to detail for excellence. As follows: 1. Blight is usually strain or variety specific and is easily constrained by climate variability and solved easily with cross or genetic breeding. Source and type of blights was never explained probably because it just can't happen the way depicted. 2. Dust storms would be limited to a few limited environs and would soon hit bedrock. Besides, crop rotation and contouring should have solved that problem. 3. Drone was suppose to have been aloft for years using solar panels, but no solar panels visible. Propulsion was? 4. The pulp fiction fable of no Apollo/non-moon landing event is not taken seriously by anyone who is a middle school graduate. 5. McConaughey did his famous finger rubbing thinking prior to kicking a tire but what makes no sense is how kicking a tire makes a vehicle functional. 6. Movie relied on an excessive amount of loud tonal sound effects to create drama when writing and acting just not up to the task. 7. Communicating in barcode or Morse is not how any intelligent future beings would rely on. And, later the gravity–quantum equations coming from the future in Morse which doesn't have Calc encodings. Certainly not through watch hand movement. 8. Female role model in Hathaway was cast for smile/looks not for contributing anything believably intelligent. 9. Dad, Dr. Brand, also poorly cast only for accent and stereotyped science look. 10. Dropping bombs on starving people was presented as a solution – that sounded really ridiculous. 11. Looking for new Earth in another Galaxy when your own offers millions of possibilities is like looking for new home on the other side of the planet when one just like it is next door. 12. The energy required to open or even enter a wormhole would be equivalent to the total of our Sun's output for a thousand years. Also, if you can place it next to Saturn then why not closer like next to Mars to make transporting humanity easier. 13. The wormhole as well as the blackhole would shed matter to subatomic particle size. Communicating through a wormhole. Whoever wrote that has no idea of the scale of problems. 14. Speaking of Mars it can be terraformed with a few H-bombs to release CO2 to warm the planet thus melting subsurface ice to give H20 thus oxygen. 15. Turning on and off hibernation is not like opening the fridge; too many opportunities to damage cells. 16. Underground centrifuge space station was constructed of massive concrete which has only compressive strength not tensile strength. 17. Centrifuge center had a Saturn type rocket (100m high) which when blasts off should destroy that whole complex. In reality a complex that large and built underground would bankrupt half the world. 18. Those quantum gravity equations would not fit on that small blackboard. And, why are they using a blackboard in a tech world capable of traveling easily through space? Surely they must have at least an iPad! 19. So, not explained was how love brought Cooper through multiple dimensions (possibly Universes) to the exact correct time & space that Murph happened to occupy. Probably because the writer couldn't. 20. TARS sounded military dumb and those legs are not designed for surviving uneven surfaces without damage, let alone running. 21. The film's ending of throwing papers, the Eureka and the anonymous kiss was typical Hollywoodish. 22. Ranger view of Earth did not show a devastated planet but normal cloud cover; normal water and land color. 23. Five dimensional space-time is decades old-hat. Seven, nine and for the past dozen years; eleven dimensions is now the most likely mathematical construct. Remember that's all this is - a construct. 24. The effort to push books off a shelf would either be equally the same in all dimensions or not possible so that extra effort shown was just dramatic invention. 25. The interweaving of 1990s cars and other old tech, such as lap tops, all simultaneous with space vehicles & stations not yet achievable for several more decades, didn't make sense - incongruous. 26. The alternate Earth being made habitable by altering some made-up chemistry between chlorine and ammonia and their relation to N2 didn't make planetary chemistry sense, especially since such a planet would be hundred thousand times more rare than the more abundant habitable planets; also most likely more than a -100 degrees below zero. Conclusion: So many holes in this film that only a worm would love."
"Review of Interstellar : OK, my first IMDb review. I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I love Nolan's work and I'm a science fiction fan. Sadly within an hour I was wondering if I could stick out another two hours. The actors are all great, and they get the few stars I'm willing to give it. I will admit that directing a big production like this is not for the faint-hearted and I'll give Nolan points for that. However, the story is so poorly constructed it just piles on frustration after frustration. Other reviewers on here have described the litany of illogical errors. I haven't read all 900 reviews but we have long known that black holes EAT stars and planets, and when they do, they give off titanic bursts of gamma and x-ray radiation that would sterilize entire regions of a galaxy. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief in service of just enjoying a movie, but when the entire premise is to find a more suitable home for human life and then you choose a planet apparently orbiting a black hole, well that just goes from suspension to just outright disbelief. If Batman had chosen to just use his magic freeze gun to stop the nuke in Gotham I think most Batman fans would have been groaning. That's the way someone like me feels about lazy plot devices like this. There is also WAY too much unnecessary dialogue in this movie, the superb cast are wasted saying clichéd and hackneyed lines. The whole punchline of the ""ghost"" you could see coming in the first hour, so you just ended up wondering how they would get there over the next 109 minutes. I'm sorry but I thought the music was intensely annoying and was just designed to jar you awake every half an hour. Then there is the whole ""Don't open the airlock! Don't open the airlock!"" I was sitting there thinking ""Just open the damn airlock and get it over with."" Everything was either entirely predictable or completely illogical. Floating frozen clouds? Seriously? The least they could do was have Tinkerbell fly onto the set and explain how that could happen. I guess because Cameron got away with nicking Roger Dean's floating mountains in Avatar, Nolan thought no one would complain. But let's face it Avatar wasn't exactly trying to be clever and that's where this goes over the line. If you're going to delve into the BIG questions like Quantum Mechanics, Relativity and black holes you set yourself up to be measured by a whole new set of rules. Nobody complains about Harry Potter flying on a broomstick but have him try and explain it using Einstein and you're going to be in a mess of trouble.As for the reviews comparing it to 2001, the only things it has that are the same is that it is set in space and there is a wormhole. Absolutely nothing else is the same and frankly it is an insult to compare this to Kubrick's masterpiece. And when people say, ""get over it, it's just a movie"" they're rewarding someone for being lazy. Just like Gravity this had all the elements to be a masterpiece if they'd just bothered to talk to a few more people in the science community besides Kip Thorne; who apparently understands the workings of the universe all except for the black hole which is Hollywood."
"Review of Interstellar : I heard Nolan answer a question about authenticity of the scientific basis of the movie. He 'fessed to changing things up but then said — and I agree with him — that audiences are OK with IF the movie is consistent within itself. Unfortunately, Interstellar is far from consistent. How the black hole is treated in completely nonsensical. Light doesn't escape but he and his ship, nor the bot, are stretched out into spaghetti by the gravity. Said hole is at first a safe enough distance away from the ice planet to not be a factor, but is then close enough to 'capture' their ship in it's vortex. Why oh why did the super-evolved humans (huh?, in and of itself) put that wormhole way out in the 'burbs and then leave a riddle within a black hole on the other side of it if their intention was to save humanity. Couldn't they have been just a little bit more direct, if they can alter gravity on the micro, high resolution level. Come to think of it, if the point of the black hole was simply to house the library thing, why wasn't that simply out in plain view? Seems a lot more sensible than having to conjure up the circumstances whereby someone would think that ENTERING AND SURVIVING A BLACK HOLE WAS POSSIBLE, LET ALONE A GOOD IDEA?!? And wasn't that actually a worm-hole, since he was looking in on the room? why did the other one require an acid trip of a tunnel to get to the other side? Why oh why is their only A SINGLE PERSON (caine) on earth working on that gravity equation? Oh, and then McConaughy's daughter, after 40+ years, which makes two.No MRIs and they whip up that space-ship (presumably one of many) in a few years. And suddenly have all that high-tech medicine, despite the lack of tomography. And cryogenics? And why are they tooling around Saturn 100 years after getting mcconaughy's message, instead going through the worm-hole to salvation, or even sending anyone else to help out Lonesome Anne? Matt Damon and McConnaughy wander off ON FOOT on the glacier and yet it takes comparatively ages for the ship to JJET TO THEIR LOCATION. they must have been fit dudes to accomplish that distance on foot on that terrain.Infuriating. The best thing was the 'music', more accurately awesome, polyphonic blasts (I mean that in a good way). I know it made it hard to hear some of the dialog, but that wasn't such a bad thing."
"Review of Interstellar : Unfortunately the film didn't reach the high expectations I had for it! I love sci-fi movies but Interstellar left me flat and disappointed.First the opening hour of the film was boring and ordinary and the 'Earth's problem' with the sand storms was somehow underplayed and unmoving. I thought that maybe when they go in space things could get better... well, they did for a while but then the crew landed on the Ice covered planet and things got pretty sour.The idea of Cooper getting into the dimensional space and wrapping the story with the beginning was good but then again the end was OK and obviously left for a 2nd film.The sound was not good at all - I could barely hear and understand what they were saying, so maybe 50% of the films sound was a high pitched music overpowering the scenes.At the end I thought - this is a film for people who doesn't like sci- fi movies, don't believe in life in other planets and are narrow minded and believe only in conventional science. I suppose they got to watch something like that and like it...I appreciate the effort of everybody involved in this creation but it's not for me."
"Review of Interstellar : Science Fiction is not an excuse for lazy writing and sloppy direction.Starts off showing flowing fields of thriving green vegetation – constantly bombarded by massive dust storms and yet continues to grow and thrive. Then, we are supposed to believe that a drone – one that can fit in the back of a pickup truck has enough solar cells to power 'an entire farm.'After that, Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan (Screenplay) expect us to believe that a retired NASA pilot, who never left Earth orbit and survived crashing his orbital spacecraft, is more experienced to go on an interstellar voyage than the astronauts that have studied and prepared for the voyage. Okay, I'll admit this one is possible, but not likely.The first planet they decide to visit – the one so close to a black hole it has significant time dilation – the one covered in water and deluged with huge waves every hour, (one of which destroyed the original exploration spacecraft and killed the pilot – not detected by the spacecraft instruments, by the way) is a prime candidate for colonization.Then, when the next huge wave arrives, Christopher Nolan (Director) makes us watch as one of the astronauts stands by the spacecraft door for several seconds (plenty of time to get in the spacecraft) watching the wave approach and is washed away. Why did he stand around waiting outside the spacecraft in the first place! Nonsensical!The next thing the Nolan brothers expect us to believe is that an astronaut who volunteered for what was probably a one-way mission suddenly goes crazy, becomes a coward, falsifies data, and turns into a murderer! Were his rescuers going to leave him on the planet to die after they found out the planet was uninhabitable! Don't think so!Later, this same coward astronaut decides to take a chance and risk his life opening the spacecraft hatch after warnings that doing so would cause a blowout. I guess we supposed to believe he is that crazy!"
"Review of Interstellar : The plot is pretty standard, nothing new at all if you've read enough SF classics. The male cast is good, the adult female cast is awful, a small number of scenes are impressive, the so-called music reminisces of chalk on a blackboard, but all that doesn't matter because...YOU CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING WHEN PEOPLE TALK. Hum, sorry, I was saying that the sound department was run by either a deaf or retarded person. And so is Mr Nolan, who possibly didn't bother checking his final product. The thing that passes for music is that loud. Reading lips sometimes help, but half the talking is through radio anyway, so good luck with that.That's when I realise that Nolan can't actually tell a story through pictures. In many scenes, what is shown is severely shifted from what should be seen, and I would really need the dialogue to explain what is happening, but I can't decipher it because, you know, idiots at the helm. In the same vein, there are quite a lot of inconsistencies and silly concepts. And maybe the writer did come up with acceptable vocal explanations, but I'll never know, because a monkey spilled the background soundtrack all over the track I wanted to hear, and nobody cleaned it up.During the projection, I was seriously and increasingly getting angry at the technical lousiness. That's a first. Hollowood has reached new levels of incompetence.Save your time and money for something made by caring professionals."
"Review of Interstellar : This film is an example of having to many irons in the fire and not knowing what to do with them, which results in an over sentimental mess that is called Interstellar. Nolan finally shows clearly his hubris in that he thinks of himself as a cinematic mastermind, in fact he's just a Hollywood pet with cheap tricks. There is nothing wrong in getting the science incorrect, a competent filmmaker manages to work around the incoherence and still create a unified whole, Nolan on the other hand wants us to think that he understands the science behind Interstellar, but he also shows clearly that he doesn't put much trust in the audiences' intellect. This results in an over abundance of exposition which is there just to inform us of how stupid we are. The sentimentality, which is most of the time laughable, doesn't go along with the overall structure of the film because the plot is disorganized. The problem comes from the inability to transform a concept into a film without allowing the audience to interpret what they are seeing - instead Nolan tries to overwhelm us with his elitist vision and it comes out as a mess because he doesn't trust his audience, he's lack of vision doesn't come from him not having a concept but from the inability to mediate that concept through a film, in other words: he is a bad filmmaker."
"Review of Interstellar : First, about the pain, which is mostly due to the sound. I don't know how many times we're in a rocket ship blasting off somewhere with everything shaking, the cameras jiggling, the astronauts grimacing, and the sound track roaring, screeching, thundering, blasting the eardrums—I really did have to plug my ears by the end of the movie. Add to that the so- called music, which consisted mostly of even higher mountains of noise, mostly produced by a big pipe organ pumping out its gargantuan decibels in the form of a few simple chords—hardly music, merely a musical instrument adding to the overall accumulation of noise. I don't think anybody should be credited with creating ""music"" for this film.As for the stupidity, I was lured into the theatre by publicity claiming that the film had got the science right, or at least the graphic representation of a wormhole and black hole. Well, the graphics may have been right, but they were pretty standard stuff as far as eye candy goes, hardly worth the price of the ticket. What about the science? Maybe it was correct on every point, or on most points, or only on a few points—who knows? Only someone with degrees in quantum mechanics and astrophysics would be able to judge. For the general audience (obviously, the audience the film was aimed at), the science talk came across as sheer gobbledygook. There was no effort to explain the ideas for the public. The jargon was just spat out here and there with the purpose of raising a smokescreen for the current plot point. Very annoying.I wanted to enjoy this film. I hated not liking it, knowing how much money and effort went into making it. But by the time we got to the last 20 minutes or so, I'd had enough and had to fight the urge to walk out. In fact, I did get out of my seat and watched the last 10 minutes or so from the back of the auditorium near the exit door."
"Review of Interstellar : I was excited for this movie. I liked pretty much all of Nolan's previous movies and I love sci-fi. Judging from the reviews, I was expecting something similar to the quality and entertainment of Inception. What I got was probably one of the most boring movies I've seen on cinema.The movie is unnecessary long, the dialogs are predictable and make you laugh, and the subject of the movie (which btw is not interstellar traveling) has been done several time before (awfully usually). We get it. Family is important, love is valuable. This is not a sci-fi movie, this is his is a family movie about a father's love for his children.I will not go into details to avoid spoilers, but there were about 10 minutes after the first slow hour that got me excited for the rest of the movie, but it was only a break and we were back to boredom and more crying by McConaughey. I found the acting pretty bad, which I guess is a result of the awful script, since I liked McConaughey's acting on Dallas Buyers Club (and partially on true detective)."
"Review of Interstellar : Originality: This movie was completely original, in the exact same way that the Hunger Games was, that is, not at all. The Hunger Games is to Battle Royale as Interstellar is to 2001: A Space Odyssey, that is, a complete rip off. Many reviews are saying how original it is, I expect these people haven't seen 2001.Score: A few people have drawn parallels with Contact, saying that the movie reminds them of Contact. Perhaps it is the pulsating metallic base throbbing noise that Interstellar ripped off?Millennium Falcon: When our heroes first take off from Earth they do so in a Saturn V type moon rocket, with the exhausted stages falling away behind them. Yet, when they later take off from the extra-solar planets, one with 130% gravity no less, they do so in the conventional Millennium Falcon kind of sci-fi way. It huts my eyes!Southern Drawl: Our hero seemed to of had a stroke for the first half of the movie and had slurry half-awake speech, yet later seemed to recover. Perhaps that's what time-dilation does for you!The Robot: Seriously? I think it was so big and square because it contained two CRT-monitors. If you asked a 10yr old to draw a robot design that would be useful on a space mission, then it would undoubtedly improve on the one in Interstellar. But my biggest gripe was, how did it walk? We have two legs(!), our trailing leg doesn't catch on the floor as it swings forwards as our foot extends, lifting us slightly. The robot in Interstellar walks like a pair of chopsticks (but without the accompanying side to side wobble that would be necessary if you chose such an impractical design).Newton's 3rd Law: Stated correctly, applied incorrectly. If our heroes' spaceship had been launched backwards like a bullet from a gun, then it would have been a cool quip, instead it made him look like an idiot corn farmer.The Best of the Best: Why! Why is Hollywood obsessed with the hero being the best of the best of the best? Couldn't he just have been one of the remaining pilots of average competence? (with a genius daughter and an idiot son).Frozen Yoghurt: At one point the Millennium Falcon Space Shuttle hits a cloud made of frozen yogurt (or was it ice?), so, a cloud hanging in the air made of strawberry yogurt, sounds a bit silly. Presumably, as with Arthur Dent's cup, it was held up by art?Emotional: But not a black hole. Possibly the best element of the movie. The human element, and the pain of loss and separation was, strangely, conveyed extremely well.A real Black Hole: Well, I wish I had one so I could get the 3 hours back that I lost watching this. It's not all bad, some bits are compelling, but mostly it's a boring re-skin of 2001."
"Review of Interstellar : I knew nothing about Interstellar other than the basic premise, and the name of a film's director is of little interest to me i.e. I know who the good directors are, but their name on the credits doesn't set my expectations at any level.I just want a good plot, good acting, and something to take away and think about when the credits roll.I got none of that with this sorry excuse for a sci-fi film.From corn fields to a worm hole? with nothing much in between? Really? Anyway, I thought CASE and TARS were straight out of Minecraft... and so was the whole premise of Interstellar. A nothing sort of movie that leaves the viewer with nothing of substance.Motorcycle, meet shark! Actually, just take the shark from the tank and slap Christopher Nolan across the face with it.The 9 and 10 star reviews here truly mystify me..."
"Review of Interstellar : The film is spectacular and starts off really nice and promises to be very interesting. But once the spaceship leaves the ground, the movie deteriorates rapidly, and as it progresses it becomes so unbelievable and ludicrous, that I left the theater quite annoyed and very disappointed. I didn't like most of the characters. They are clichés, and none made me sympathetic to their cause or character. The robot is also extremely familiar and it's design is ludicrous, trying to be both advanced and ancient at the same time. I really likes other films by the Nolan brothers, but it seems they don't give their scripts as much attention as they used to. A disappointment."
"Review of Interstellar : Judging solely on cinematography, this movie is excellent. With shots ranging from side views of space craft to wide shots of alien landscape, this movie is well done through a filming perspective. But the plot is a completely different situation.(Please note this is more a list of my biggest complaints and not a complete summary, thus many of the arguments will be more rambling than cohesive due to lack of describing every signal plot point.) The first 30 minutes present the situation on Earth very well, and also presents the problem of relatively well about a hour in. But the largest problem in the beginning of the movie is the lack development of the brother. He seems almost bastardized than loved and can be seen as a large problem from the beginning of the movie.After the first hour the plot begins to break down. The characters have to decide which planet as to go to. Amelia begins the debate with reasonable facts and figures. Cooper then presents the idea that Mann was the strongest of the group and his data was promising. Amelia presents some flaws with the argument and then Cooper makes a personal attack by saying that she is in love with the man on the planet she wants to go to. Ultimately they choose to go to Mann's planet. This particular scene was poorly done because it showed two people, who were chosen for their level headiness and reasoning, resort to using the most irrational arguments that could be formulated to, arguably, make the most important decision of humanity.Dr. Mann is presented in the later half as a predictable antagonist who is presented as a weak coward, but some how was able to live isolated on a planet for many years without killing himself. Mann has little reason to betray his fellow astronauts other than to save himself, yet doesn't attempt to persuade the others to leave with him.After Mann is disposed off, Cooper (Mathew McConaughey) seems to have omnipotent ability to fly a ship by feel in space and be precisely accurate as to where he is going, and sends his fellow astronaut to a barren planet to save some portion of humanity.While on Earth, Cooper's son, who is not as loved as Cooper's daughter, becomes an incoherent lunatic that lacks any basic reasoning. The daughter needing to find some clue for the equation in her room, burns her brother's fields. Even though the daughter attempted to move the family out of the house and get to the room without violence, she burns the fields without attempting to reconcile.By far the largest problem of the movie is its deus ex machina, ""the fifth dimension"". The movie presents the fifth dimension as love, and makes blatant foreshadowing to this in first half of the movie at the beginning of the movie. In a movie that presents its self as intelligent and competent of science, then it would know to some degree that love is essentially a chemical in the brain. To change from a scientific view with unknowns about the universe to having love being a metaphysical object is absurd. It would have been better to present the human mind as the fifth dimension rather than one emotion.Through the use of the fifth dimension, Cooper enters a black hole transmit data back to his daughter through time and saves humanity. In essence, future Cooper sends past Cooper into the worm hole. All with the help of future humans that created the fifth dimension in the black hole. Thus the movie at the same time created a preposterous dimension and a time traveling paradox.The ending ultimately was lack luster, with an exception of Cooper meeting his daughter for the last time. Cooper is found by the colonization ships and then goes off to find his fellow astronaut.The movie is three hours, which is far too long for such a predictable and hole ridden plot.In total, for the price of one ticket you get pretty awesome visuals, occasionally good character development, and a horribly flawed plot."
"Review of Interstellar : I hated this movie, it was literally one of the most boring, long, tedious, exasperating movies I have seen. I wanted to leave, but my husband wanted to finish watching it. I was confused watching this movie, trying to figure out what was going on. First of all, the characters talk about all the things that are gone, I.e the Marines, scientists, food. It is never explained why these things are no longer available. The whole scene at the parent conference was ridiculous, saying that this teacher believes that we never went to the moon or into space, it was a hoax, what?! Especially considering the main character was a former test pilot for NASA. This is a small town, you would think they would know this. There are so many problems with the plot, I can't mention them all. They ( Cooper and his daughter) found this secret NASA facility ,who knows where, yet they welcome him with open arms and offer him a job as the pilot. .???? If he was so great and he used to work there, why didn't they call him?RRRRRRrrrrr, I was very frustrated during this movie, time was dragging! If you like to see close ups of Matthew McConaughey crying, you might like this film."
"Review of Interstellar : One of the biggest letdowns to come along in ages. Not even McConaughey can put an interesting spin on this half-baked, ham-fisted rubbish. It's an amateurish mess of clichés, clumsy exposition, pretentious nonsense, cheap manipulation, and predictable twists. I felt like walking out, but I kept thinking at least there might be some stunning visual effects coming up... nope. The space scenes are serviceable at best, the alien planets are either a blank expanse of water or a blank expanse of ice, apocalyptic Earth is just like normal Earth except with some dust blowing around... where exactly did that big budget go?If you dislike this film within the first twenty minutes, don't waste your time sticking around. It doesn't get any better."
"Review of Interstellar : Yeah, that's about it. More using his balls than his brains, the lonely cow-boy finds his true mission, struggle and win against all enemies, even taming the black hole, saves the world and in the end leaves in the sunset to go back to the woman who's eagerly waiting for him.People dare comparing this to ""2001""? Yeah, it's long, like 2001, and spacey. But where 2001 is all in allusion and mystery, this movie explains laboriously again and again what's happening, just in case.Most scenes are long. So long. The ships try docking and fail, again, and again, for long, long minutes. Stranded in inhospitable landscapes, they escape repeatedly each danger from the unknown (the huge wave, the slippery ice, the toxic atmosphere), so that even the most inattentive spectator gets it.The acting is good, and images beautiful, therefore it deserves 3."
"Review of Interstellar : Somewhere in Interstellar is a decent 90 minute movie padded to 3 hours. I thought it might feel long; what I didn't expect was the cheap, weepy emoting and Hallmark philosophizing.As for the padding, at least 40 minutes goes by before anyone mentions space, yet nothing of the ecological disaster is explained in any depth. No point is so trivial it can't be made ten times, no scene so long it can't be stretched beyond the breaking point. And oh, the sap – love is described as a kind of quantum effect that transcends time and space (as long as it's between parent and child).The supposed scientific accuracy was limited largely to the depiction of stellar lensing around the black hole and the silence of space. Howevvver Why do pickup trucks look exactly the same in the future? Why is the dust all over the trucks and house but not the crops? That was the most ridiculous robot I've ever seen (I love the comment that it was made of ""spinning HVAC ducts""). How does this lurching refrigerator even get itself through a hatch? Its interface is a crude text screen worthy of a PCjr, yet it has a complete human personality (so much so that I had a hard time distinguishing its voice from the crew).Do you always launch your rockets from the middle of your office buildings? Remarkable how those glass partitions in view stood up to the blast.Apparently having no idea of what a wormhole is BEFORE being sent through one, Matthew is shown the rudimentary folded paper analogy. Wouldn't that have come up on the first day of class? How does a mile-high wave form out of foot-deep water? The planet orbits a black hole? Where's your light and heat coming from? Any problem with the intense X-rays usually found around these things? Guess not.On Matt Damon's planet, exactly why aren't the ""frozen clouds"" falling? At least Avatar posited superconducting rocks and intense magnetic fields to explain their floating mountains.When Matt takes Matthew out to show him the ""surface"", just how far do they walk? The rescue pilot flies at hundreds of miles an hour for at least a few minutes.When Cooper returns to our solar system, at least 60 years has elapsed since he received his daughter's video messages (since she is now in her 90s or more), so has Anne Hathaway been alone all that time on her planet? I don't recall any mention that she was going to be in a slow time region. By the way, time only slows down significantly in a very high gravitational field, which they showed no signs of being in.Besides all that and much more, the plot was disjointed, with inarticulate dialog and confusing placement of people. For example, during the entire scene of the boosted entry towards the black hole, I didn't know Cooper was in the shuttle, separated from Anne Hathaway in the station, until he looked across at her.It's not a completely terrible movie, there are some great visuals that are impressive in IMAX. But they're dragged down with the padding and cheap sentiment."
"Review of Interstellar : Went in to see this film this afternoon and had high hopes. After an hour in I realised that I nearly nodded off twice as the music score playing over the beginning quarter of the film was sleep inducing to say the least. It didn't help that not one of the characters was engaging in anyway possible, especially Matthew McConaughey's drawling southern accent. It seem to take an age for anything to happen in the film, and finally when there was some movement, director Nolan slows everything back down to a snail's pace. I'm not saying the film was ridiculous as it is purely science fiction which I normally enjoy, but this was a challenge for me to stay till the end of the film ,-( two gents in the theatre walked out just over an hour in and never came back), I unfortunately didn't have the hindsight to do the same, otherwise I would have got over three hours of my life back to watch two good films.When the film is released on DVD/BR, I hope they have a cut that last's about 1hour and 20m which should make it an entertaining film without the huge unnecessary spongy filling."
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar is not a bad film. Lets get that out of the way... Nor is it a great film either.It straddles the fence of imperfection ever so well. There are some great moments and then there are some very long drawn out moments that make you shout at the screen and say, ""Shut up already and get on with it!"" Once such scene came when Anne Hathaway was talking about love... a lot. Yes, there was a lot of talk about love and analyzing what love means. That moment sucked me out of the film, because I found it hard to be dragged into the immersive experience that Interstellar should be, when it is coupled up with such bad writing that doesn't blend in a scene well.Such out of context reality smashing moments happen a lot in Interstellar that makes you wonder if the writers were tripping out on their own interstellar experience. Another scene comes at the revealing of a betrayal, of sorts, from a certain character. Without going into too much, all I'll say is that the scene felt hammy, rushed and again, didn't blend in what was going on. While I 'get it', as in the reasons for the betrayal, I didn't 'get it' in terms of why it had to happen, and it just felt... strange.By the time the film matures in the middle, it goes downhill and your left on a spiraling out of control adventure that is the result of some new age writing gone bad.If that wasn't bad enough, I had to put up with the endless scenes of key dialogue that I could hardly hear, because Nolan likes to blare his music up over important dialogue. Maybe it was just the Cinema sound system being extra enthusiastic, or maybe once again, a criticism that I've aimed at Nolan before, is that he really needs to edit his movies better and get an editor that doesn't make it hard for the viewer to hear what's being said. It is blatantly criminal in the sheer bad editing that this film suffers from.The film does have its good moments, although I would have to call them rare, but again the visual effects are splendid and is possibly the only reason why this film is a 6 for me, and not a 5 or lower. There literally some scenes in the film that made me go 'wow...' and look on with delight. It's for these scenes that you need to go and watch Interstellar, but be warned, that the rest of the film performs below its expectation.Major Gripe: Time for a major gripe, and I thought it would be the editing of the film, but no. It comes down to design. Now, I've read that there are those that liked the robots, TARS, and CASE. That's fine, and I'll admit the design is unusual and somewhat funky. Yet the positive reviewers probably don't or won't, look at the faults in design. Well I saw the fault in the design all too clear; In one particular scene, just after getting out of the shuttle after landing on a new planet, TARS is scene 'walking' for want of a better word, onto the planet. Yet I caught that moment when it awkwardly tried to maintain its balance. What was it doing with its left leg? I wondered to myself... And ever since I saw that strange fault, I couldn't let it go. The more I looked at its wobbly movements and its rather awkward looking design and its very human personality with its very human non-robotic voice, I just couldn't get into it that this was a robot. I kept on imagining a guy in a suit... and that's the problem.When you design a robot for a film, you need to get it across to the audiences that this is a robot. Not some strange puppet on a string or anything else, but a robot. Sadly Nolan failed in getting this across because of the voice being used, because of the very human personality and because of the rather awkward looking way it just went about. There was nothing about the robot that I honestly liked, it just didn't feel like one, and at no time in the film is it explained where the tech came from, impressive tech at that, yet it just didn't translate well onto the screen.Interstellar is a decent film. Is it worth the prestigious rating of 9.0 that most reviewers give it? I personally don't think so, and I think in a lot of cases such positive reviews come from the reviewer being dazzled with special effects and in a lot of cases that is the case. It happened with Gravity; people were so amazed at the effects they just threw 9's at it all day. Interstellar is not about any of that, it's about the story, and sadly, it lacks a decent one."
"Review of Interstellar : I think I watched the same film as all the others on here that disliked it. I enjoyed the cinematography and the effects but there is really nothing else about this film I can say I liked.I think Matthew McConaughey is a great character actor but in this film he just didn't fit, for me. His voice, stance, mannerisms all seem out of place. Like he just didn't care and wanted the paycheck. Not that all the blame for the bad film can be put on his shoulders. The rest of the cast, all but a small few of them, just weren't entertaining.From the maker of Inception I expected more. What I got was nearly 3 hrs of not a very good film.3/10 for the visuals. That's all I got. Disappointed."
"Review of Interstellar : so so so so boring. first of all, its 3 hours long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no need for it to be THAT LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and most of it is them talking. when it does get to the good part, which is only one part of the movie, that's it, one part that was remotely interesting. i even skip'ed 30 mins at the start (because it was way to long) and i never missed a thing, i pretty much just missed the story time about the dad and the daughter. i usually say with not so great flicks, give it a watch if you have nothing better to watch, like i done when watching this movie.. but its not even worth watching when bored!! if you're hardcore into sci fi, aliens, mars, and astronauts, then you might like it. i liked the martian way better than this."
"Review of Interstellar : Ok, I'm a big fan of both Matthew McConaughey and Matt Damon, and this movie had some good acting and good special effects. Some of the story was even believable and interesting, but when it came to that whole book shelf in the worm hole thing - well that just ruined it for me. So let me try to get this straight - did McConaughey go into a black hole or was it a worm hole? And once inside the whatever kind of hole it was, he ended up being outside his spaceship and behind his daughters bookshelf. And then he just suddenly woke up inside a hospital?!?! So who went in the hole to rescue him? I'm sorry, but once the bookshelves came into play, I couldn't figure out what was going on and it didn't make any sense! Plus, McConaughey left Earth when his daughter was a little girl, and when he finally sees her again at the end of the movie, she is very old and near the end of her life. You'd think they'd want to spend some time catching up, but they spend about 2 minutes together and that's it."
"Review of Interstellar : Hi all! The film combines Science and Fiction. To be honest, they stuffed too much of everything. At the end of the film, I realized that I did not understand anything at all. My friends for this reason decided to revise it. And I think that the film in which nothing is clear is worthy of 3 stars. Thanks to all."
"Review of Interstellar : OK, I'll keep this brief, but I'll also nail my credentials to the mast first. I know science, cosmology, sci-fi and film-making pretty well. I have, in the past taught film studies at degree level, and worked on the production of more than one major Hollywood sci-fi film. I read Stephen Baxter and I like space stuff a lot. More than a lot. And why am I telling you this? Because I should have loved ""Interstellar"", but I didn't for one simple reason: It is a truly dreadful piece of film-making.I won't even bother with dissecting the ""science"" in the film, because that isn't really the issue (it is wrong on pretty much every level). I'm not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. And I'll ignore the sub-standard special effects - because FX don't a great movie make.The issues I have with Interstellar are essentially these: The film is an arse-numbing three hours long, and feels far longer. The pace is stunningly poorly judged - the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost.The characters are paper-thin, and I didn't care about any of them. The plot is entirely derivative (mostly of the vastly superior ""Contact""). The special effects aren't special at all and the editing (or lack of) is so self-indulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. The result is a plodding, flabby, and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact.I won't go on, but special mention must be made of the planets - Paddling World and Coldworld. You see virtually nothing of either, and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor CGI painfully inferior to ""A Perfect Storm"" and a location less dramatic than your own back garden.I've probably not been a brief as I intended, but as I write this I feel the disappointment and actual anger I felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. It was a total let-down and a waste of more than three hours of my life. The gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd, and I am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me, or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. I am fairly confident I didn't doze off, although I desperately wanted to.So in conclusion, ""Contact"" did all of this far, far better, fifteen years ago. In Contact the characters are human, believable, beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. The relationship between Father and Daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. But then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway, dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, the science is accurate and entirely plausible (it was written by Carl Sagan after all), the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle, and it has something very profound to say.Contact is everything Interstellar is not, and it has a considerably shorter running time. Contact brought tears to my eyes, Interstellar bored me to tears."
"Review of Interstellar : All of the fanboys and girls must have also been in love with ""The Emperor Has No Clothes"" too. This story is thin, the characters are under developed, the emotional and logical shortcuts are ridiculous, Matt Damon is horribly cast and has become a caricature of himself, the set pieces are not inspiring, the music cues try to be bombastic enough to create emotion that simply doesn't exist and the science is a mess. When a self-important filmmaker reaches a level of success where no one will tell them ""no"" anymore, this is what comes of it. The scientific equation that sums up this film is as follows: Nolan + Interstellar = Lucas/Spielberg + Crystal Skull. A completely unremarkable and forgettable film. The Emperor truly has no clothes."
"Review of Interstellar : Here's its 2 stars...I saw it in IMAX so I enjoyed going through the wormhole. Other than that? Well, let's get started...It's so typical - almost clichéd! - the way billions of dollars are spent on the visuals of movies these days and zero dinero on the script. Interstellar is a prime example of this. It just might be the definitive example.I'm not going to go into the science much because I'm a tad science- and space-illiterate but even I could see glaring holes in this tripe. For one thing, what kind of impossible tidal forces create a mile- high tidal wave out of 2 feet of water? Why weren't drones sent into the wormhole instead of people? That corn looked pretty green to me, didn't you think so? What's going on in London or Montreal or Buenos Aires or anywhere other than Kansas? Is Kansas the last place anyone is? Can't the black guy just once make it to the end of the movie? Why is NASA housed inside the Bonaventure Hotel? (okay sorry, I'm from LA and recognized it right away)Did Matt Damon owe someone a role and that's why he's in this tripe giving the worst performance of his career? Why weren't Matthew M's grandchildren and great grandchildren the slightest bit interested in him? Who the hell cast Matthew M in this? How was it possible to relay ""tapes from loved ones at home"" across those distances but nobody could relay anything back? What was up with that stupid robot?Okay, forgetting science and crazy-ass tesseracts for a moment...the human element of the script was incredibly eye-rolling. Remember that notoriously stupid moment in Armageddon when Liv Tyler screams ""That my father up there!""? Well the entire ""human"" aspect of this story and all the dialogue seemed to be written by whomever wrote that classic line. What was so wrong with treating the audience like intelligent people and giving then a straight, highly scientific, awe-at-the-majesty-of-the-universe, harsh reality sci-fi film that didn't insult you at every turn instead of this z-grade soap opera with neat-o visuals?"
"Review of Interstellar : How this travesty of a ""sci-fi"" movie has garnered so many gilded reviews is proof that either A) I am way out of step with the great, unwashed movie-going masses or B) the aforesaid masses have never seen a truly great ""sci-fi"" flick. This movie was interminable; I almost walked out 38 minutes into the run, when Mathew was still just a former test pilot trapped in the body of a corn-huskin' farmer. Which leads me to my first problem with Interstellar: would you ""hire"" a corn-huskin' farmer and devoted Dad of 2 to be the pilot of an intergalactic space mission? Aside from 1 or 2 very brief allusions, there is ZERO explanation / justification for Matt to be selected for this mission. And strangely enough, Michael Caine ages not 1 day in the 23 years since Matt blasts off for ""strange new worlds"".He is still in the same pants and shirt as he was when Matt blasted off (23 years before); the directors did give Mike a wheelchair for good measure. Before I proceed, there were 2 or 3 somewhat interesting plot twists, and the CGI / special FX were very good (just like ""Gravity"", another recent ""sci-fi"" disappointment); although the robot was utterly ridiculous; more like a walkin', talking' 21st century soda machine or a ""Gen 12"" Robbie the Robot. Of course, CGI and special FX alone do not a classic ""sci-fi"" film make. I cannot disclose 2 major plot disappointments due to the ""spoiler"" clause but suffice it to say the powers behind this film have tried to fuse an entry level class in quantum physics with an action film; and it just didn't work. I have now accepted, grudgingly, that for enough money you can get the finest actors to play in the most ludicrous films. Read the cast list; scratch your heads in disbelief, along with me. And if you want a classic ""sci-fi"" movie? Try 2001, Blade Runner, and Alien."
"Review of Interstellar : You know those special movies that leave you with something more than you had before you watched them? They enrich you, teach you, show you. This isn't one of those. Interstellar is the pathetic result of a lot of bad ideas slamming together in Nolan's mind, falling out as broken disjointed garbled mush in the script.The script isn't the only problem with all of it's hammy hokum and lack of character. Even the heralded special effects are so cliché at this point that they hardly add anything to this abyssal cavity of broken ideas. Here is what happened. Nolan saw some discovery channel show, or perhaps PBS, about the cosmos. He said to himself, ""I could make an adventure movie about that."" Unfortunately for those of us who recognize good cinema from average and just slop, he couldn't.I watch zero budget movies with more thoughtfulness than this two hundred million dollar nightmare. Trade me all of the special effects in the world for one moment of realistic human emotion.As cynical as it sounds, after seeing the 9 of 10 rating for this garbage, I question whether or not humanity would even deserve to be saved from the cataclysm."
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar, while visually stunning, is one of the most flawed films in recent memory. Flawed, because more time was spent rendering out the special effects than developing a screenplay worthy of the cast and budget. When you're a filmmaker who can make anything you want - on film - there is no excuse for your films to at-least bring something new to the table and work at a basic screenplay level.Interstellar does not ask new questions and with a script that literally feels like a first draft --I'm just shocked that Nolan didn't develop this more. The entire core of this film is the relationship between our lead Cooper and his daughter - but this is so rushed and honestly, extremely cheesy, that we don't care what happens. They spend far too much in time in space - with a ridiculous plot involving Matt Damon - and cut back to Earth is sporadic cuts that pull us into so many directions.This film proves that the Nolan brothers can not handle a couple of things: writing females and writing emotional characters that we're attached to. The dialogue was laughable - over the top in many places - and basically just a ton of one-liners. We cut from Cooper learning he has to go to space - says goodbye - boom on the rocket - NO ATTACHMENT. There is zero development here - just get him to space, which fails to tell the core story well - which bites this movie in its ass in the third act. Forced. Rushed. However you want to put it - I'm sorry folks - it's not a great movie - not even a good one. Everything is spoon fed to the audience - no, not just the science - the twists - I didn't know on the nose screen writing was so acceptable in Hollywood - guess it is. They talk about ghosts so many times within the first act that anyone with half a brain KNEW there was something there - and if you know anything about space travel, black holes - or any of the stuff that is talked about in the trailers - can put two and two together and call the major twist in the FIRST ACT. Come on Nolan, you can do better."
"Review of Interstellar : This movie is incorrectly classified as science fiction. It is actually anti-science fiction and, by the way, in all other matters a serious insult to any person's intelligence. The problem with directors these days, even supposedly talented ones like Nolan, is that they try to appeal to everyone and end up appealing to no body. Big money talks louder I guess. Damn you Hollywood.But what pisses me off about this movie is its anti-scientific and anti-technological approach. The subliminal message, that perhaps makes most Nolan fan-boys mentally masturbate about, is that you should not care about rationality, you have to use the power of LOVE and screw logic thinking. OK, so why the pseudo-science mambo-jumbo? If you want to do a Terence Malick trick, don't mess around with science. Being a physicist myself I am of course more sensitive to science fiction plot (worm/black) holes - especially these kind that completely suck any credibility out of it. But even if you are not scientifically literate, and this movie surely is not meant to appeal only to scientists, you should feel insulted. I won't go into any details, just because the ""pencil through a paper of sheet"" wormhole explanation or the ""oyster and pearl"" analogy really raised the bar way to low for me to care about it anymore. Sending ""quantum data"" to solve an ""equation""... WTF? Just throw in the ""quantum"" word and that's it. Sorry to tell you, but ""quantum data"" means nothing. There is no such thing. No quantum physicist uses that expression for anything meaningful, especially in the lack of any recognizable context. Surviving through a black-hole trip (cough cough); talking to your Minecraft-designed robot (seriously??) while you're in the ""3 dimensional box, inside a 5 dimensional universe..."" WTF? It's just stupid, childish and downright ridiculous. Pseudo-science rubbish, which pisses off scientists and sends a completely wrong message to everyone else about what science is all about. Science is about rational thought, passion also of course, but mostly about consistent and carefully constructed logical thinking. This movie is the antithesis of any logical thinking. Just because, you know, love. I enjoy a good, deep, emotional story but the crappy pseudo-science completely spoils it. Kids, this is not science fiction. I am deeply disappointed. Thanks for that Mr Nolan!! Comparing this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey is outrageous, both Mr Kubrick and Mr Arthur C Clarke would be deeply embarrassed to find out that their legacy would be turned into this.Save your money and wait for a BR rip, if you really like being intellectually insulted. MR Nolan didn't do anything to deserve getting your money in his bank account."
"Review of Interstellar : The movie did not need to be almost three hours long...this was a great example of why it is a bad choice to let a director have the last say over edits, cuts, and length of a film. So many scenes could have been cut.The only interesting part of the film was when the characters finally made it to different planets. However, all the science leading up to the adventure of going to different galaxies seemed to be a lot of mumbo-jumbo...lots of theories and big words to confuse the audience so that we think it could be possible.The last thirty minutes almost was incomprehensible...the explanations of what happened in the earlier part of the film didn't make sense...but because it was explained with a serious voice talking and serious music behind it, people who don't understand quantum physics (which are most of us) will think it does.Plese Hollywood, reign in Christopher Nolen a bit."
"Review of Interstellar : The good: The creative design of their robot +1the visuals of the water-planetmaybe the ice-planet as well+1Things that made this film bad:All the scenes that did not add anything to the story, including the very slow start.The sabotaging behavior of Matt Damon, was just added to make drama. From the moment Matt attacked Matthew, I knew the movie was bad.That the crew members would believe Matt's description of the planet is unlikely. The planet was visibly frozenIt will always be pointless to reach the center of a black hole, since it would mean certain death. They tried to describe it as a necessary sacrifice, but the thinking behind was just nonsense.I have no Idea what they tried to illustrate as happening in the black hole. There are no books to be found in a black hole. Timetravel backwards in time is impossible.The excessive use soundtrack music and unnecessary loud music. The plot overall was far from something that could have happened in reality."
"Review of Interstellar : This is my first review on here but I had to say something. I just left the theater and I haven't felt like this in 15 years. Yes, that's right, not since 1999, not since, dare I say it, ""Star Wars - Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace"". And I've only been waiting for this movie for a little over a year!All I have to say is the following; Interstellar was an incoherent, implausible, unscientific, misandrist mess.*** SPOILERS BEGIN HERE ***1. The protagonist in this film, Cooper, is denied the prize of his journey and sacrifice only to give it to the female characters of the movie. His daughter inherits the knowledge of both her father and Caine's scientist character and mysteriously solves the gravity equation which inexplicably saves the world. Anne Hathaway's character is saved by Cooper's sacrifice so she can become some galactic 'Eve' on a new planet. Ridiculous. What is she going to do, make an appointment at the IVF clinic on planet X? Is she going to give birth to ten daughters and artificially inseminate them in turn? Nonsense.2. The antagonist, Matt Damon's character, is nothing but a caricatured villain whose motivations are never explained. He is shown as being weak and a coward. No one with these qualities would ever volunteer for a mission like this or last this long on a desert planet without killing themselves. They even called him Dr. Mann which makes him come across as representing all men as weak and evil. Ugh!3. The old and wise scientist turns out to be a liar. Michael Caine's character is shown to have duped everyone on the mission because he knew somehow that plan A would never work? He's just and @#$#? WTF!4. The brother, who for some reason Cooper doesn't give two @#$% about turns into an insane madman.5. The mission which takes them on a journey for thousands of light years of space travel only to circle back to a little girl's bedroom to show that a girl's intuition and love trumps science on any day of the week! Absolute nonsense!!!THE ONLY MEN IN THIS MOVIE THAT ARE GIVEN ANY REDEEMING QUALITIES IS THE BLACK MAN AND THE ROBOT.Mr. Nolan, and I'm sure you read this garbage, please take this advice for your next film: You don't need to water down your male heroes with emotional drivel and juvenile female sentiment to get women to watch your movies. You did this in Inception and TDKR when you jammed in Marion Cotillard's awful emotional subplots into an otherwise brilliant story.Take the example of 2010: Odyssey Two. A forgotten sci-fi gem of the eighties. This movie had a very strong female lead played brilliantly by Hellen Mirren. Her character was most believable because she was in balance with her equally strong, intelligent male counterparts which included Roy Scheider and John Lithgow (anyone catch the hot dog reference?).If you modeled this movie after 2010 instead of 2001, I think you could have reached your biggest audience. Unfortunately, I will not be part of this one.I gave this movie two stars for some original ideas the movie tried to do. The story, the score and some god-awful performance by Matt Damon made it impossible to keep this movie together. Etc, etc, etc...DSMan"
"Review of Interstellar : I loved most of Nolan's films. Memento, The Dark Knight are among the best movies I've watched. Sadly I can't say the same about Insterstellar. I can't understand what happened with Nolan on this movie. The plot is a complete mess, filled with arbitrary nonsense they dare call science. It spends time explaining what a wormhole is and then it throws in some metaphysical bs about the fifth dimension which does not make any sense. This is not a sci-fi film it is a fantasy movie. The visuals are the only redeeming quality this movie has. But however great they are, they cannot save this mess of a movie. Weak, forced acting with dull dialogue makes this one of the weakest movies I've seen this year."
"Review of Interstellar : OK, I am far from a critic.I generally have an open mind about films. I watch a lot of them. I don't even take the time to review many. But I just don't understand how everyone thinks this is a good film. First, let me point out the good things. The soundtrack was amazing. Maybe it didn't work with every scene but it was nice to listen to. The production value was almost flawless. The space scenes were very believable. The acting was generally good. I like most of the actors in general. BUT....the story..plot....I am not going to get into too many details. It just didn't work. You are fed so many physics/science concepts with no explanations. It's like taking one sentence from every science article on the net from the past 20 years and saying ""just believe what I am telling you"", even though it's impossible to understand from such simple dialog. Then you are expected to believe......well MANY ridiculous things that somehow just happen. I'll leave it at that. I am going to bed."
"Review of Interstellar : I like movies. I watch them a lot. I personally know 2 of the actors in this film, and also some people connected to the scoring. After all the hype I was geared up to watch it. I fell asleep once within the first hour and drifted in and out of consciousness throughout the film. It's too long, waaay to much dialogue - a completely bombastic storyline and Matthew just irritated me.I could give a much more well rounded review and get all academic - but its not worth it. I really can't sum up the words to say how much of a dull experience this was. There are some crazy visuals once they eventually get into space - but the dialogue and the actual audio mix is really lame.Watch it if you really have nothing else to do - or perhaps if you're a drug user it might work better under the influence. Since I don't take drugs - that's just a wild guess - it might - actually - make it even worse. One thing for sure - I wouldn't watch it again. Not for all the tea in China."
"Review of Interstellar : This movie attempts to be serious and it has good believable science in it but then they do things that just make you want to scream at the writers. If you are going to ask me for suspension of disbelief please be a little consistent.A space ship takes off from earth boosted with a three stage rocket about the size of a Saturn 5 rocket. That same ship can then take off and reach orbit from two alien worlds with out any boosters, including one planet so far down a gravity well that there is a time dilation of one hour to 7 years. At one point three ships are moving away from a black hole with no thrust but when the smaller ships separate from the larger one they immediately fall back into the black hole. There is a 300 foot ocean swell on a planet where the ocean is only 1 foot deep.It seems like every time the writers wanted to add some plot device into the story they added a new convenient constraint to their universe. For example you can communicate normally in one direction through their worm hole but only a few bits per day in the other direction. Our hero is an ex-NASA pilot who even though hasn't been in contact with NASA for 20 years is given the task of piloting their latest ship.I hope anyone who took high school physics would feel insulted by this movie."
"Review of Interstellar : For me, Nolan is becoming like M Night......He has reached that point, or some producer, where they continually push and try to top whatever was done in the past. Yes, that should entirely be the case.....but not to a point of stupidity.M Night tried to always shock, and that stupidity moment was The Happening.No pun intended, but I didn't feel that the characters really understood the Gravity of the situation, they never seemed to be bothered, and I mean really bothered about the loss of time. For example....do you think after travelling 2 years away from my kids with the prospect of never seeing them again, that I am going to accept a team mates stupidity that leads to the death of someone and the loss of 23 years? Seriously, there would be some trouble afoot!!! Do you think a character that has sat around waiting for said folks to return after 23 years would be in any state to continue with the mission? Have some coca and lets get on our way........The killer for me was the last scene where the main character is shunned and ignored by his grand kids, and great grand kids. Yes, get out of the hospital, Murph wants to be around her family..... No one seems to truly acknowledge that the hero of the planet was of any worth, and he is pretty cool with that!I can handle he Blight, the 5 dimension, the space travel and more, I just cannot abide by inhuman behavior......Exit by stealing a space craft with Deep Blue.......sigh........."
"Review of Interstellar : 8.8? I'm just not feeling it.Total ""snoregasm"", I swear. It's VERY slow to start, then disappointing once it does get going. I'm one of those that has to finish nearly every movie and book I start, no matter how bad. It took me 3 days to finish watching because I could only stand about 40 boring ass minutes at a time. Quasi-science muddled with current theory and overstretched artistic license, and let's face it; McConaughey as ""humanities last hope""? Yeah, we'd be screwed. He's not altogether that bad, but in reality the coolest thing about him is his Air-stream. The improbability levels in the ""science"" and the story make it difficult to get into it."
"Review of Interstellar : Yet another hugely costly below average movie. Just three things I can remember about it. Self indulgent rubbish. Time may slow down approaching the speed of light. It definitely slows down watching this grandios turkey. There must be more original, exciting stories out there that could be made for a fraction of the cost. Can someone please make the book ""Deathworld"" by Harry Harrison into one please. Read it and you'll see. Perfect vehicle for ""Arnie"" and Cooper. Sad that the movie industry has more money to work with than the actual scientists working these problems out? From this movie they deduced more information though so that is the only redeeming thing I can think of to come from this rubbish."
"Review of Interstellar : I'm writing this review a month after seeing the movie, so I could be excused for forgetting some of the details. In fact, I've forgotten almost everything about the movie as I've got no idea what it was about!I have a minor hearing problem. It rarely causes me any trouble, but 30 minutes into the movie, I realised that I had not been able to understand a single sentence - either because the ""background"" music was so loud, the dialogue was so soft, or I couldn't understand the actors' accents. I didn't walk out because I thought that the visuals may have helped, but two hours later I still had little idea of what was going on, and I didn't believe any of it anyway.I've given it 2 out of ten for the photography and special effects, which were amazing. If I thought it might have a reasonable plot, I would have considered buying the DVD when it comes out so that I could read the subtitles, but, having read IMDb's description of the story, I don't think I'll bother."
"Review of Interstellar : To my mind a science fiction film should be either entertaining or interesting. This film was neither. It was pretentious, long winded and boring.
If it's not going to be entertaining it should at least be reasonably scientifically accurate.
Which it wasn't.
The idea of building an Interstellar spacecraft in complete secrecy with no budget was somewhat laughable given the developmental and logistical implications of such a feat. Then to employ a retired reluctant astronaut to fly it even more so.
Later on in the story, they land on a planet so massive that the astronaut orbiting it ages 60 years whilst they are on it's surface for 30 mins.
A human being on a plant that size would be instantaneously crushed by it's gravitational forces. Not mention the fact that they left earth's atmosphere and gravitational pull on a huge rocket ship but then land and take off from this massive plant in a small shuttle craft?
Not even taking in to account how the astronaut orbiting managed to find the food, water and oxygen to survive 60 years in total isolation on a small spacecraft.
To cap it all, after travelling for what would be thousands of not millions of light years he returns to find his daughter (albeit in another dimension) happily living her life whilst he watches her through some inter dimensional bookcase.
Story line: father loses daughter, father gets daughter back again.
Sorry, I think it's a case of the emperor's new clothes.
People spend three hours of their life watching this and then are too embarrassed to admit it was rubbish. They will then go on to tell anyone who sees through this pretentious ego trip as not intelligent enough to understand it."
"Review of Interstellar : My girlfriend and I decided to watch this movie at home as we missed it when it was doing the rounds in our local cinema. How glad we were, for at least it meant we were able to sip on our wine and chat in between - which we would have not been able to do had we watched in the cinema. And we did a LOT of chatting, mostly about the direness of the film itself. I can't believe so many reviewers thought this film to be amazing (but then we're all entitled to our opinions - and we all know how opinions differ to the extremes at times). However, I honestly couldn't connect with ANY of the characters in this film - particularly the leads. I really have no words...just found the whole film totally ridiculous - and don't even get me started on Hans Zimmer's background music!!! We needed subtitles for some scenes as the music was so overpowering we couldn't hear a word that was being said. I was even so bored at one point that I started to imitate Matthew McConaughey's irritating 'whistle' as he speaks. Enough said methinks."
"Review of Interstellar : The hype was monumental, so I just had to go see it. Oh the humanity! Oh the Humanism! Oh the special effects! My boy and I left the theater blinking and scratching our heads over the loose ends and the heavy slathering of deep inner meaning which, unfortunately, proved largely incomprehensible for our plebeian minds. Oh well. The similarities to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" were embarrassing at some points, although I assume most current movie goers have not seen this 46-year-old film. Throughout Interstellar, there was a lot of weepy overacting in various attempts to dramatize the effects of relativity on time and the resulting differences in human aging. Then there was the subtle, underlying message that humans are the gods who will rescue humanity. I prefer the capital-g God as my rescuer, thank you. This film was a special-effects extravaganza, but, ultimately, pretty lame."
"Review of Interstellar : Not only does this have a boat load of scientific issues, but it is painfully long. You'd think that they would have had enough time to explain the back story to the Earth's problems, but nope. The whole premise of this tiny secret NASA group is bizarre and neither Cain nor Devane are believable in their roles. Minor annoyances like the worst robot helper ever. There are ones in reality today that would have been better. Hell, Robbie the robot was more advanced for his time.Some good effects, but too much unexplained and yet it takes hours to get through. Glad I didn't see this in a theater."
"Review of Interstellar : Honestly, I have no idea why other people, and everybody really, has been giving this movie such high ratings and rave reviews. To me, the entire film is poorly thought out, contrived drivel.It starts with the beginning of the story, where Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) more or less by accident tries to break and enter into government property by applying a bolt cutter to the gate of the secret government complex where the mission is being planned, and is subsequently enlisted as the mission head pilot, of all things. I don't care if we're told that he used to be an Air Force pilot and apparently a notable one at that with old acquaintances in high places; that was a big letdown in storytelling, erm, right out the gate for me. Just too lazy for a film of its (attempted) magnitude.With all the good reviews in mind, I thought I was at least going to be wowed by the rest of the film's plot and the imagery. Well, with the cheap availability (in film studio terms) of pretty much even the grandest CGI effects these days, there was nothing about the imagery that ""Elysium"", ""Oblivion"" and particularly ""Gravity"" haven't already done in recent times, and better, and the whole plot not only disappointed with half-hearted but self-indulgently attempted forays into philosophy and some semi-spooky abnormal phenomena, but also by its ignorance of some quite basic natural laws. While the idea of time dilation within the gravitational field of a black hole was actually somewhat well explained, you just scratch you head at 500-foot monster waves on the water planet which suddenly rush across a vast expanse of otherwise knee-deep water that looks about as agitated as a reflecting pool (think Tsunamis back here on Earth). Also, there is no such thing as a more gentle black hole which won't spaghettify you as you approach it and therefore kill you dead. The list of errors goes on far beyond this.And finally, the last 20 minutes or so sucked worse than the black hole whose (imagined) innermost we get to see. It felt like a bad rehash on acid of the scene in the first ""Matrix"" sequel where Neo meets the Architect. A culmination of all the things that make the plot of this movie so dreadfully banal.Again, like I said, I just can't understand why people would think that this is a good or even an outstanding movie. Yes, I know that this is a film which would like to get you to think more deeply about the issues it raises, and pick up on its whole philosophical angle. And I generally really like movies like that. But sorry, there are many films which have done a much better job at this, without falling flat on their face in the process.Long story short, after close to three hours, I felt about as robbed of my time as Cooper when he watched the video transmissions of his ageing kids from back on Earth."
"Review of Interstellar : As a plot I thought this movie had a lot of potential. I was disappointed however. After 25 minutes I just found it boring. The acting is terrible and you can hardly hear what Matthew McConaughy is saying. He just seems to be mumbling all the time. Also there is very little or no humour, most of the characters seem to argue with each other and the only interesting line was something to do with one hour being equal to 7 earth years, ""so let's make every bit of it count."" I ejected the DVD before half an hour was up....but maybe I'll return to it at some point. I am just glad I never went to see it at the cinema."
"Review of Interstellar : I was thoroughly enjoying the first hour and a half of the film to progressively become more and more confused and disappointed. I have been told to watch it again to better understand it but I have spent so much time during and after watching the film trying to make logic of the ending. I understand part of the appeal is the far fetched sci-fi themes that I usually enjoy and find quite intriguing but this film went too far. Spoiler alert! The fifth sense when he is pulled into the black whole doesn't make sense. How did the advanced beings know to put him in his daughters room, how did he magically get out of the black hole and appear outside a giant spaceship colony thing in the future. I could go on for hours. I can't understand how a film with, in my opinion, one of the worst ending I have ever seen can be so popular. The Lego movie makes more sense than this!"
"Review of Interstellar : It is beyond me how people can claim the movie to be 'brainy', 
 'intelligent', 'well written'... With all the things I read about the 
 movie prior to seeing it makes it the biggest disappointment I've 
 experienced from cinema in years. I give 1 star to bring balance to the 
 current rating, in reality this movie is of course not that bad.
 
 The whole idea behind the plot is that McConaughey ended up in this 
 blackhole where 5 dimensions were compressed into 3 dimensions and 
 stuff, and where he was able to manipulate gravity by sending his 
 daughter the message which was imperative for saving humanity. So what 
 in fact happened is through this ridiculously improbable chain of 
 events McConaughey ended up inside this blackhole. All this was 
 apparently the result of a bigger plan all along. Was there really no 
 easier way for (future humans/aliens) to transmit this data, and if 
 they built this time-space warping machine inside the blackhole - means 
 they had access to the data all along? And also means they chose 
 McConaughey daughter on purpose? So I don't understand, what was this 
 purpose? Could they not have connected their portal to professor's 
 office a long time ago, or go for one of the ten billion more rational 
 alternatives?
 
 On a side note: is it not funny how McConaughey ignored the message NOT 
 TO GO from the same 'ghost' yet followed the rest of the directions? 
 While in the end of the movie he idiotically repeats his feeble 
 attempt. Had he added 'it's you dad' or any other sensible hint he 
 would have saved his daughter years of suffering (and maybe a lifetime 
 for himself when he realises this). And I don't even want to get into 
 how ridiculous it is that he transmitted data by moving the hands on 
 the watch, which was unaffected after being picked up, meaning it was 
 hardly gravitational manipulation was it? What was the point of trying 
 to be scientific and trying to explain it in this way then. If he could 
 do that, he ought to have found a better solution that did not require 
 his daughter 25 years to figure out.
 
 And anyway, they saved humanity by building this massive station named 
 after his daughter (by that time they knew what he went through and 
 they still named it after her?). Why couldn't they have done the same 
 thing on Earth? Just build the same goddamn station on Earth without 
 needing to harvest their gravitational energy bullsh*t, bam, humanity 
 saved in the same way.
 
 Grand ideas don't make great movies if you can't deliver them 
 properly... It is atrocity to compare this to Kubrick's masterpiece..."
"Review of Interstellar : A good friend of mine, the writer Mark Shulman, once pointed out that our standards are being gradually eroded, so that sadly, we are left with less and less in lieu of a threshold of acceptability, finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow, imperceptible boil.Christopher Nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that Interstellar is a love story. I will take them at their word and assume that whatever else I picked up on was left there unwittingly, for the rest of us to parse through. Considering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a Saturday night, I feel like it's my prerogative, when I have paid good money, to take a film apart if I am still hungry for substance at the end of it; and I WILL get my nourishment from something or other, if not from the movie's plot itself.The first thing that strikes me, when I think back to the experience of Interstellar, is that it leaves me with nothing, emotionally - no takeaway. I did not care about any of its characters, or believe they were real, and I did not really worry about the fate of humanity (any more than the film itself actually does, beyond paying it casual lip-service). I wasn't awed like I may have been by other wondrous space movies that Interstellar measures itself against (or steals from), and I am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again. (I suspect most viewers won't either, once the collective neophile contact high has passed.)For starters, I do not like the moral core of the story: Interstellar is a film about ""saving humanity"" but it is unclear who will pay for humanity's failures. The film offers a great debate over where to repopulate, but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place. There is no therapy, no penance, no sacrifice. In a way, this represents a subconscious confession about our culture's moral failures: when we run out of spaces to consume, and out of fertile ground to slash an burn, we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into, since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have...But enough psychobabble. A dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about Interstellar.The worst thing about the film is that, to quote my girlfriend, ""It's OK to for characters to talk in pseudo-scientific gobbledygook when the show is Star Trek, because in Star Trek, they all have pointy ears.""Interstellar may be worth a glance, certainly for the photography and exciting visuals, but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions. Clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters, but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial self-sufficiency amid the vast nothingness. The result is an often far-fetched and unintelligible, outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewer's disbelief (and cringing), to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so.In hindsight, it makes perfect sense that Nolan's 'tightest' film is Memento, a dis-cognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together, or to remember where he started.Interstellar is not an intelligent picture, but a pseudo-intelligent one. It seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots - a sort of space odyssey version of ""who wants to be a millionaire?"" Its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior. To whom? No one knows. This technique seems to be trending within the Nolan's filmography.For the rest, the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale, (black hole, wormhole, same difference,) and is often plagued by ridiculous star-studded cameos that shatter the viewer's concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup. The film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits, and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite, contrived exposition, filled with emetic pseudo physics, sure to give an immature modern audience raised on Batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce. Worst of all, it feels long and never ending.Sadly, good science fiction is hard to come by, harder than a good ordinary film even, and although this picture is somewhat entertaining, it fades away from the heart and mind, like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed, as we head home from the cinema, once more."
"Review of Interstellar : It is incomprehensible to me that I watched the same movie that the majority of reviewers of this movie on IMDb seemed to. Perhaps I was unknowingly sucked into a blackhole, wormhole, or plot hole that most of the other reviewers of this movie managed to avoid. All I know is that my hard-earned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with me and for that I am truly regretful. Like a few other commenters, I had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters, even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless endeavors. A ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases, very little of this movie makes any sense at all. It amazes me that Nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time, as their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel.I should note that on several occasions, I actually couldn't help but laugh out loud at the absurdity, and that fact was truly telling for me.Mr. Nolan, et al - you owe me two hours and forty-nine minutes of my life back!"
"Review of Interstellar : This year is not very good for the sci-fi cinematography. Besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre (like X-Men: Days of Future Past), there was actually only one big-budget movie worth watching: On the Edge of Tomorrow. It seems like Tom Cruise is one of the few Hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles. His recent achievements leave little to desire: Valkyrie, or Knight and Day are good at worst, with the high pitch of Oblivion. Are we able to say the same about Matthew McConaughey? Unfortunately, not. Although his recent movies are above average (True Detective or Dallas Buyers Club), the latest picture he plays in, Interstellar (directed by Christopher Nolan and written by him and his brother), is a huge letdown and misunderstanding. I don't think anyone being fond of ""hard"" science-fiction stories will like it. Here is why.Firstly, the story. It is in general similar to Mission to Mars or The Red Planet, where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission, which result will impact the whole human race. Unfortunately, which is the usual problem in this case, the whole plot is neither engaging, nor entertaining. We have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space. Maybe because of the long time span of the picture, the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters. Besides, the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children (which is also a time-consuming thread here). Anyway, the main conclusion of Interstellar is the banal statement that ""love is the most important thing in the world"". Do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this? By coincidence, the second problem is the length of the movie. Currently, when the the picture is recorded not on the tape, but in the digital medium, every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible. Maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might, skills or wisdom? I have no idea, but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours, having the plot for only half of this time. This is exactly the case with Interstellar. The presented story is far from complex, and could easily fit in two hours. In fact, the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences...This film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3...The number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy...The Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word ""magic"" (interchangeable with ""nonsense"") comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here...The music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him.Unfortunately, it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult. People like to go to the movies and see a good story. There are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie: the mystery, the convincing scenery, the real characters we could care about, finally, the emotional strain, often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to. Interstellar does not offer anything of these. It is a long and boring sermon about the future of Mankind in the universe, pretending to be the science-fiction movie. With this picture Christopher Nolan proved his only memorable work was Prestige and the Batman trilogy was not the accident, but the clear sign that his main achievements in Hollywood will be too long, boring and utterly disappointing pictures, initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema, but leaving in a complete, sad disillusion after all."
"Review of Interstellar : In the opening night, I walked out from the movie theater, totally disappointed to see one of my favorite directors has diminished himself to such a low lever of performance.Poorly developing plot, immature explanation of astrophysics, unbelievable and unrelated events and characters, especial effects leveled to a Disney comedy, and horrible music are only parts of my negative impression. Even Mathew McConaghey did not seem believable looking at her daughter, older than himself. Mat Damon probably did his career's worst acting. The robot was another annoying part. What did Anne Hathaway and two other guys add to the story?Using a laptop to bring down a drown and control an inter-galaxy spaceship??? Finding a livable planet after passing through the worm hole, in ""another galaxy"" seemed easier than finding an ATM machine in a US interstate highway. Why would a director hire a ""Black-Hole-World-Expert"" as an executive producer to explain a worm hole function by drawing a line on a paper and punch it with a pencil? Just reading the worm hole article in Wikipedia would give you much more sophisticated knowledge.Mr. Nolan looked completely confused in delivering a solid message: Awareness of climate changes, saving human species, teaching relativity theory to common movie goers, or the power of love. Each of them bold and superficial."
"Review of Interstellar : 'Memento' and 'Inception' had some problems, but their ideas stretched the imagination. 'Interstellar' only delivers the bombastic silliness one would expect if a puffed-up Batman director thought he could eclipse Kubrick's '2001' with a puerile adventure story. Christopher Nolan's new film begins badly and steadily declines as its long-winded prologue introduces the stereotypical elements of a Steven Spielberg/Norman Rockwell Sci-Fi co-production - a widowed ex-astronaut farmer, his chiseled jaw, a feisty daughter, a crusty grandpa, a dying Earth, dust storms, paranormal activity, baseball, cornfields - and lots of corn.After about an hour - which seems like two - a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity. Once they've journeyed through an intergalactic wormhole, the implausibility dimension expands to cosmic levels. Scientific hocus-pocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis, deranged astronauts, spaceship chases, time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy Hallmark-style climax. The visual effects are above average, but far short of awesome. When all is said and done, the film's self-importance and mawkishness leave one rooting for humanity's extinction."
"Review of Interstellar : This is without exception one of the dumbest films I have ever sat through. Or perhaps it's a masterpiece and I'm too dumb to understand it? Anyway .....Here are some of the things (the list is not exhaustive) that I could not get my head around.There is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world. And the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says, 'Oh well. Dem's the breaks' and does nothing. Seriously? Apart from that one dude in the 'super secret' NASA compound? Okay then.A super intelligent, super advanced alien civilization has been watching us. They see that the planet is in peril. That more than six thousand million people will die from starvation. So they offer a solution. Not by curing the blight mind. No, that would be far too easy.They construct a wormhole (they being five dimensional creatures 'n' all) close to Saturn ('cos Kubrick had already used Jupiter in 2001). The film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight (cornmash beer anybody) but it's only a matter of time before that too succumbs. So It's a matter of great urgency that the astro-heroes get to the ol' wormhole as quickly as possible. So the far side of the Moon would be a handy place to put it. No, no, noooo.They place the wormhole beside Saturn. So distant from Earth that it takes two years just to fly there. And all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called Dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at Pharming College. Anybody for cornflakes? Now NASA have already explored the wormhole. They know that it opens into another galaxy, beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds. Because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole, time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on Earth. While back on ol' Planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace. So this was the plan?By the super intelligent aliens? Is someone taking the p*ss? There were no planets anywhere that were ... um ... NOT right beside a black hole? Super intelligent? Doh! And so finally, after a number of silly subplots, our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole (My God! It's full of stars?). And experiences time as a physical construct. But is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? Hell no. He is shown his daughter's bedroom on the day that he left on his 'weekend getaway.' We see him getting really upset that his daughter isn't picking up on his STAY ...... STAY! gravity assisted message, even though he should remember that she shouted STAY .... STAY! to him on that day, and he left anyway. Sheesh! And Zimmer's soundtrack? I hadn't heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email, without him ever seeing the movie. Explains a lot really. Presumably the email went something like 'If you produce anything orchestral like Kubrick, you're off the project.' So the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven (in the cinema where I watched it) piercingly loud quasi classical discordance. Bear in mind that Kubrick chose the pieces by Strauss, etc., to assist him in editing the movie,and then realised that they actually fit perfectly, and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned.Not Nolan.NoSirreeBob! Email it in, Hans.Who listens to the music anyway? Deeply, deeply disappointing.And I loved Inception!"
"Review of Interstellar : This is weird... I love Science Fiction and I love astrophysics, but disliked everything about this movie. The start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake. The second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap rip-off of Space 2001. The movie just didn't do it for me at all and the acting was average. I'm totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10. Maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality, story-line, plot, acting, and uniqueness - as this movie doesn't have any of it. Ah well, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next SF movie and hope it will be somewhat better, because I am deeply disappointed by Interstellar as I expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 million."
"Review of Interstellar : I found this pretentious crap. After some 80 years of being addicted to movies and being a fan of Science Fiction from the days of Astounding and Galaxy, very few films have lived up to expectations. ""2001"""" the best of the lot. The mix of sugared family relations and hand-on-the wheels spaceship driving like a racing car plus some probably very expensive gadgetry was too boring for me, sorry, I did not last the fulll length and had to find my own wormhole like fast forward to the finish."
"Review of Interstellar : I watched this movie yesterday. I was very excited after reading so many perfect 10 star reviews for this movie so I was expecting a perfect movie, really!Before I continue, I must say I really love sci-fi movies, and I am deeply interested in black holes, time travel, wormholes, interstellar traveling. Wow, I couldn't think twice, this could be the perfect fit for me! I had really high expectations.For the entire movie I was feeling like: ""the best part of the movie should soon"", but never came. I had hard time understanding what was really happening, and too many minutes of the movie were badly wasted in dramatic scenes of love, confusing speeches, formulas. All I wanted to see was the wormhole travel, spacetime and gravity distortion, galaxies, nebulae, etc. I mean, I wanted to see what is in the deep space, and what could be human life in a planet million light years away from us.SPOILERS AHEADMaybe the movie drove me nuts, or I lost interest, but after they crossed into the new galaxy, all I felt was confusion. I never understood what was really happening, what were they rescuing, what were those 3 planets and how they knew too much about them, why was there a black hole? Even I tried hard connecting every scene and plot in the movie, I failed. What I disliked the most was the fact that the feeling of discovering something AMAZING and new was not successfully transmitted to us. I wanted to feel that great emotion of discovering deeps space but I failed. Instead the characters talked about crazy physics and plans to save humanity. Not to mention the multi-plot scenes after the fight, totally no sense.Please don't get tricked by this website and fake reviews ad I did. This is reason I signed up at IMDb (first review), to warn others. The idea of the movie is fantastic, but poorly developed and acted, totally confusing, too much cliché. Watch it but don't have high expectations as me, you will be disappointed."
"Review of Interstellar : His 4th dud in a row, a ridiculous plot, for some reason the earth is reduced to only producing corn, so no animals, birds or fish, even though the scene by a lake the water looked clean and refreshing. Seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground. never mind lets move on, once again Nolan's characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things. anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears, she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so, the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on, the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle, the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away, just one example of quite few.the biggest plot hole is this, for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space, he becomes super intelligient, because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind, how he knows this we do not know, given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable, he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code, anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever. now to the film making, others have mentioned its look , well to me it looked shabby, endless shots of aircraft wings, no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars. during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close. in fact thank God i did not see this in imax, would have been a complete waste of time. and now the noise, with hans zimmer's worst and most bombastic score , added onto very loud sound effects, with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches. the end did not make any sense at all. but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsover."
"Review of Interstellar : This is the movie that proves what many people by now have already realized: People are being payed to write 10 stars fake reviews! Let me tell you this: This movie is really NOT that great!First, it's too long. It takes one hour just for the space mission to start.It's slow paced and VERY sentimental, or, in other words, most of it is boring.I'm not an English native speaker, but my English is not bad either. I have no problems watching movies in English, and yet it was very hard for me to understand the main character's mumbling in his farmer accent. All other actors spoke properly, except him, the most important one.The plot is not very logical: Planets just in front of a giant black hole?! Yes, this must be the place to live everybody is dreaming of.Imagine your colleagues in the space station would say to you: ""OK, we're now ready to fly down to that planet. You wait here. Don't worry, we'll come back soon, in... some YEARS!"" You'd probably smile and say: ""Wonderful! OK, go now!"", right? One day they come back and are probably surprised to see you haven't committed suicide because of depression, even though you waited 23 years (!!!) for them. You must be the most patience man in the entire Universe.And again a female ""scientist"" who looks like a model and behaves like an amateur. An obligatory part of every sci-fi movie nowadays.This is just to give you an idea. There is much more, so read the other negative reviews.Good night. And good luck."
"Review of Interstellar : As you can probably ascertain from my title sentence, I am not a fan of Mr Nolan. However I don't have any bias prior to watching his films, in fact quite the opposite, I want to like his films, as I really like his ideas and concepts, which is why it's such a shame he never delivers.I also seem to be in a minority with my views as his films seem to have mass appeal, certainly if you look at money they make, but so far, they have all left me cold.Interstellar, TDK and Inception all have similar flaws: On the positive side, they are all really cinematic, stylish and well filmed. They all have really atmospheric music and nice special effects.On the negative side, the plots are terrible and make no sense. The dialog is flat and unrealistic, there is no charisma or charm in the films, they are functional and soulless and they lack any real depth or meaning. The characters tend to be robotic and cold, not warm or humorous.The problem is when you put these two elements together you basically get high expectations that something great is going to happen, but ultimately nothing does, so it becomes a major let down.On to Interstellar specifically (warning spoilers a plenty): The first hour of the film, was very boring, and very silly. The Earth is running out of food, so people still plant huge fields of crops, which they destroy when driving through them for no good reason. They have completely automated the process of farming crops, yet they don't need Scientists or Engineers, they need farmers, which makes no sense.If the Earth was starving then the crop fields would be fenced off, taken away from farmers and it would be a controlled process. Scientists and Engineers would be the most valued members of society. If the crops were so valuable they wouldn't be exposed to the elements and the dust. They would be covered and protected. Everyone is so worried about the food shortages, they don't take any notice of it. Instead they drive around in huge petrol driven SUV's from 2014 (where's the Google cars or electric cars?).Here's an idea. You now have the ability to hibernate on spaceships, so apply that to the population of Earth and reduce the need for food. Anyway let's move on.They go into space, arrive at some place and immediately land in some water. Do they survey the area first, check out the planet and landing area first in detail, nope they just land. Now I know there is time pressure, but why haven't NASA sent numerous robots into space to visit these planets and send back information.Anyway this drags on a bit, they visit another place, which is another disaster and then we get to the point of the film (only after about 2 and a half hours). Cooper flies into a black hole, where he would normally be crushed and killed instantly, but survives in some kind of advanced framework, where he very predictably sends the already sent messages back to his daughter. After this there is a very silly ending. Even though he is outside of time, as it were and he can send messages to any point, he can't for some reason stay in the same time as his daughterAnd how stupid was the 1970's Minecraft designed robot.In the end the visuals and atmospheric music was great, but the plot, soul and charm of the film was completely missing, unfortunately like all Nolan movies."
"Review of Interstellar : Some directors can pull of the feat of writing and directing, Tarantino comes to mind. PT Anderson is another. Even though this was co-written between Christopher Nolan and his brother, the Coens they are not!This movies is a perfect example of how making a movie (as my amateur film maker friend put it) is like building a cathedral. Being good at making stain glass does not make you a good brick layer, and that task is best left to ones who know what they are doing. To whit, we have this monstrous piece of pretentious drivel which attempts, as so many big hollywood movies do, to gloss over hastily written sequences with flash and bombast. This is another movie that feels like it was written by a committee of executives who were barely aware of the history of film and watched a couple of youtube videos on The Grand Unified Theory and tried to write something all smart-like. This movie is so scattered and convoluted it's hard to begin, and many other reviewers have pointed a lot of the plot elements that are glossed over with yet another ""yeah, that happened, deal with it"". Here are some of the things that I audibly groaned over:Why not explain what happened to Earth when every other part of this movie is explained like the audience is 5 years old?If the technology is available to build spacecraft with cryogen chambers, how about producing new forms of food? Lab grown meat for example? Hydroponic greenhouses etc?Why are the robots basically mechanical jenga pieces? How does that design make sense? The robot REALLY bothered me, especially how there was absolutely no effort to actually make it sound like a robot, it basically sounded like exactly what it was, which most of the time was just a guy inside a cheap plastic box. His voice didn't even sound like it was coming out of a speaker. HAL sounded like a person, but still had a creepy quality to him that sounded vaguely artificial (""what a moment, wait a moment"").And then there is the idea that you could actually get anywhere near a black hole (let alone wormhole) with relatively recent technology and survive. I have a rudimentary understanding of physics, but even I know that the radiation would turn you into goo pretty fast, space suit or no space suit.And a guy waits in a spaceship for 23 years by himself and doesn't go insane and looks basically the same except for a few grey hairs in his beard? I could go on and on....This movie tries really, really hard, there is a lot of balling actors showing off their chops and trusting that they are making a masterpiece, which I imagine every actor must do, but alas there is no saving this movie. It tried too hard to be all things, part 2001: A Space Odyssey, part Armageddon, part Inception and fails on all counts. Everything about this movies hints at greatness, the effects, the Phillip Glass like score written by Hans Zimmer, the tears swelling up at climactic scenes, but it is all empty packing around a bad story. This movie is a shiny car with hamsters on a wheel as the engine.One positive outcome of this movie is that it has reminded me to read about physics out of interest, but not to discuss them like I know anything, as I will come across as pretentious as this movie.I suggest everyone watches 2001 to cleanse their pallet and to be reminded of what truly great film making is about."
"Review of Interstellar : Let me start by saying, I'm certain I would more than struggle to make a better film. I am humbled by the energy, love and devotion required to produce the few moments that literally flash before our eyes. I also consider myself a huge fan of the Nolan brothers. Following, Memento, The Prestige, Inception, all films of exceptional quality and fantastic storytelling. For years, Christopher Nolan has worked literal movie magic, telling his audience exactly what to expect from the very beginning, yet delivering a performance that leaves them no less than astounded.Interstellar begins no different. Nolan practically hands the ending to the audience leaving little to surprise. But unlike previous masterpieces, Interstellar drags the audience on a painful, bumpy ride through space, time, love and death leaving some in hypnotic wonder. The rest, simply insulted, wishing for nothing more than to get back the past 169 minutes.""Stay,"" a message delivered by Cooper to his daughter across space and time, and yes, we knew it was him all along. ""Stay,"" the message potential viewers should hear loud and clear. ""Stay home."" It's safe and warm. Revisit Memento, The Prestige or Inception and marvel at the layered depth of stories told so well you ache for them to be told again and again and again. Perhaps next time the Nolans will deliver on that hope. Until then, ""Stay away"" from Interstellar."
"Review of Interstellar : Let me start by saying that I have enjoyed Christopher Nolan's work in the past; Memento, Insomnia, (parts of) The Batman Trilogy. I find him a very talented film-maker with strong ideas and visual sense. Therefore it makes me very sad to state that, categorically, this is an absolute turkey. In many places, the plot is so full of holes, that you can do little but laugh-out loud. There will be reviewers on here, talking about DEPTH, Intimations of Mortality etc etc. Forget it. This is just a total misfire. Actors used to say, despairingly, that they were playing Johnny Exposition - you know the guy who explains everything to the audience. Note I said Despairingly. This has almost every character explaining everything from wormholes to the Mystery of Love (oh yeah). After a totally boring, drawn-out beginning which seems to be there to prove that Nolan has watched The Grapes of Wrath many times over, we get the first huge laugh when we meet Sir Michael Caine, with a laughable Posh - Cockney - American accent. He is playing the part that Sam Shephard (in this) or Morgan Freeman (usually) play. He is not up to it; never was never will be. It takes a certain amount of skill to be able to deliver line after line of pseudo-scientific gobbledygook and make it sound real. Caine's performance - like so many of his performances - screams out ""Where's my bleedin' paycheck?"" When Coop (Gary Cooper - westerns - get it) agrees to fly this practically suicidal mission to the outer reaches of space, he blasts off like a Cosmic Cowboy, all bravado and charisma - at which point his fellow crew member shows him - with a pen and paper - what a wormhole is. Yes, when he is leading a flight into outer space, a little late doncha think? It gets worse, when poor Anne Hathaway, playing, as my son said - Science Girl, has to recite a monologue about Love and how it can cross all dimensions of space, time, blah blah blah. I really felt for her. I won't expand on the Plot, I couldn't if I wanted to. And the last 30 minutes have to be seen to be disbelieved. This is NOT one of those films that you see and forget immediately, you will wake up in a few months time, laughing at Michael Caine's last scene or his recital of Dylan Thomas' famous lines - not once but twice...and the End. Oh the end. McConaghey gives it his all, having to cry on more than one occasion - believe me, I know how he felt. Don't believe anyone if they tell you 'you didn't GET it'. That's like saying you didn't GET an episode of Two and a Half Men. Ambitious yes, but a turd is a turd - even if they meant to produce a new hybrid Rose."
"Review of Interstellar : I am wondering if the people who write ""intertstellar"" 10-star reviews are actually sane, or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is sci-fi. Basically if the sic-fi component - most of which does not really happen until the end - is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic Hollywood soap opera. The worn-out rag of cliché family relations, all- American-dad, ""complicated"" love affair, unruly and a classic tomboy-girl, co-workers (more like co-idiots) who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally, you know, to ""up the ante""... it really makes up 90% of this movie. Up until half- way trough I honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director. There are also very obvious holes in the plot, and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sic-fi movies at least try to amend somehow.I can not help but think that after watching Automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards, this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump. It is literally that bad. What saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending. So just watch that instead, because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of Santa Barbara.Spolers about ridiculous plot holes (as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough): 1) The stupid Dust Bowl recycled. Seriously? I am not even going to try to explain this because I'd need to re-post have of Wikipedia here, but it does not work that way. Not in the past - not in the future. 2) The moment NASA abducts the main character and daughter and questions them. Seriously? Maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3) NASA's facility is top secret! Right... in the age supposedly after the present, when there are drones and google maps, they manage to hide a huge facility in some old James Bond villain fashion. 4) ""LET'S GO TO ANOTHER GALAXY!"". OK if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket, carrying a futuristic ""shuttle"", WHY for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there - instead of looking in our own? What, they really expected to have better luck there - than in our own? They already searched the entire Milky Way? And what's even better - it ""just so happens"" there is a planet like a stone's throw away from the black hole and is NOT being consumed by it, and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything BUT a collapsed star? Why... let's just start diving down toilets, because you know, they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions! Like dimensions of dementia perhaps! 5) Saving the best for last - I did like the ending. Despite its absurdity I did like it. Almost cried - if I were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology, but I digress. The ""machine"" that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future- past, is built by... the very humanity he is trying to save, that survived, and built the machine in the future. Lord have mercy, I will try to explain this... So basically if we consider all major theories about time travel, in order to change the future one must go there and change it, right? But here the future changes the past, and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed future's help. Mind >>> blown!"
"Review of Interstellar : this movie was awful, I was deceived by the fake rating. it was full of pseudoscience, so superficial and boring. every single minutes could be challenged by a science professional. being a PhD student in science, I envy SciFi script writers and directors that they can pop up any bullshit and be praised by non-professional audience. such a ridiculous robot, underground NASA that launches billion dollar projects in famine a condition, the huge tide on that planet without considering the depth of water, entering the black-hole unprotected, LOVE being the 5th dimension, contacting through black-hole by pushing the books! Oh my! can anybody be more superficial about science? my advice to anybody who has a critical mind: don't waist your time."
"Review of Interstellar : I believe this movie should be rated 5-6 stars.
Cooper had the ability to communicate with the past, he just can't tell NASA or his daughter the destination???
If Cooper gave the right information, they could avoid all the death and sacrifice.Mankind from the future could control gravity, and space time, and they failed to gave solution to blight????When Cooper returned to the space station, he could share all his adventure stories, so future generations learnt his adventure, and in time, when they have the scientific ability, they could pass this information to Cooper in the first place or even people from even earlier. It's a paradox.Nolan tried to be scientifically correct. Cooper gave his daughter a mechanical Hamilton watch. I believe everyone knows how a mechanical watch, it is driven by springs and gears. A mechanical watch's movement direction won't be changed permanently by gravity. Gravity would slow down the watch, but when gravitational influence were gone, the movement should go back to normal, so there is no way, Cooper could use gravitational force to ""encode"" a message into the mechanical watch because the hand of the watch wouldn't stay ""jumpy"": moving back and foreth. He would have better luck using gravity to leave message on the floor. The whole ""watch"" narrative was a big mistake.Cooper loved his daughter, okay, but what about the other kid? He acted as if he only had one kid. That's just weird.It is a good movie, black hole, wormhole stuff are easy to understand, but when you really put your brain to it, you see plot holes. Entertaining but this movie is actually quite stupid."
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar by Christopher NollanReviewed by Svetoslav GrigorovFirst, I had to look at the score on www.IMDb.com to confirm that all the rumors were true (9 out of 10): me and Paul were the only ones who didn't like this movie and left 45 minutes before it had finished. Whatever that means I can assure you that I was/am still sober and I am not a zombie like the rest of the crowd in the Kettering Odeon cinema. Secondly, I would like to ask how all these critics made the comparison(s) with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and thirdly, please you who now read this review tell me that I am not the only one in my dullest disappointment for the year. Tell me that I haven't lost my marbles, tell me that you were enthralled from this copy of a House On The Prairie and if you think that this is the best movie of your life (or at least 2014), the only answer I can think of is: that's why so many rubbish movies have been released lately. Because the level of the quality has fallen drastically and the conveyor belt of the movie industry is catastrophic for the senses. OK, so straight to the point. First 45 minutes we are introduced to the farming, dust and the coming famine problems, nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, Earth is doomed, father and daughter found a super-secret location that NASA strategically placed for their eyes only. We see a lot of corn and even the nineties Children of The Corn was a better shallow slasher while this one turns out to be an American clichéd space marmalade, and my best fitting comparison for it is Armageddon which is not really a movie, but a joke. Wormholes, saving of the human kind, bringing resources, planting/replanting, Plan A /Plan B, frozen embryos to colonize a distant world, overcoming gravity, scientists and even a quantum physics and so much camera- philosophy that Kubrick will turn in his grave, daddy-please-don't-go-to-space-cause –I'm- gonna-cry, bam the watch on the floor (I don't wanna see you anymore), counting while going into the stratosphere, Lego-robot which somehow was better acting than the rest of the actors or at least was more fun. Wait, wait, did I say actors? Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine (The rest of them are not worth mentioning apart from the crying daughter Murph who did her best job).Matthew McConaughey has one of the most annoying twangs ever and his jaundiced bad- version-face of Paul Newman cannot contribute to any script lately (let's not forget that without the help of Jared Leto and his masterful transformation in The Dallas Buyers Club his Oscar was going to hell). His mumbling could be understood only from the villagers in Kentucky and what he is on aboutSeriously, I needed subtitles to comprehend his actor's efforts in such a ""serious"" movie. How serious this movie was! I pushed myself to read couple of the 'serious' critical reviews and they had the audacity to call it ""scientific""??? Oh man, poor Anne Hathaway who looked sometimes at the camera and was likely apologizing for the mess she was in. I felt sorry for her.The script was the hell of the hells. Such nonsense with no credibility and no creativity at all. Total zero or even below the zero. As I said we left long before the end because my time is precious. I will open Isaac Asimov's (or Stanislaw Lem's) short stories and will be engulfed in characters and situations, so my brain will be given food for thought while all these poor people are going to see Interbol..cks and will be exposed on the radiation of a mediocrity (yes, I felt cheated like someone was trying to insult me). Well, if you who now read this review respect yourself and really like Kubrick, Moon, Gravity (and even Contact) and other good sci-fi don't waste your time and save your money. Today we wasted £40 including the drinks, the popcorn and the tickets and the only thing that I was inspired for was my generated anger for this text. My verdict on the scale from 1 to 10 is to give ONE for the director Christopher Nolan who needs a little encouragement and I am hoping he will not slip into the shoes of M. Night Shyamalan who have crafted a lot of rubbish lately as you know. God forbid that never happens.P.S.Don't tell me that I have sat there for 2 (it's actually 169 minutes) hours of a film and it had a great ending cause I don't want know."
"Review of Interstellar : This truly is a shocking movie and must rank as the worst sci-fi film I have ever had the misfortune to waste 2.5hrs on.The acting is appalling with some quite amateurish edits. The music drowns out a lot of the dialogue, which is probably just as well considering its triteness. The whole premise of the plot seems to have been cobbled together by the writers after they'd endured an overkill of everything from the Lost in Space TV series of the sixties (though at least that show injected some humour into the proceedings), through to 2001 A Space Odyssey, and the innumerable Star Trek programmes and films.Any movie that casts Michael Caine as a scientific boffin must be struggling for starters. He utters, in one excruciatingly and barely decipherable scene, ""I lied"". Well he certainly didn't act! Anne Hathaway struggles to make any sense of the quite ludicrous script and often appears that she'd rather be undergoing root-canal work, whilst Matthew McConaughey mumbles and fumbles his way through lines he can't quite believe he is expected to say.The continuity is confusing and the 'special effects' only reach mediocre, adding absolutely nothing new in this genre for the viewer.I have watched hundreds of sci-fi films and programmes and do realise that we are expected to suspend belief to a greater extent, which is why a little humour would not have gone amiss - but every character in the movie seemed to be so darn miserable and brimming with angst. This film has no redeeming features whatsoever; one develops no empathy for any of the players, and there were a couple I longed would perish within a few minutes of them being introduced into the storyline (the child who portrays the ten-year old Murphy to name but one).Sorry, but this film is not worthy of wasting over two hours of your precious life on. There again, you are quite entitled to think otherwise...."
"Review of Interstellar : Previously having been a fan of a few of Nolan's films that actually were the opposite of what this film is - masterpieces, I peeked at the ratings here on IMDb. However had I scrolled further down to see where they were coming from and what the reviews really were, I probably would've discovered the truth and not have decided to take the inevitable trip into this black hole with Nolan and suffer, something I am extremely embarrassed about and will always be haunted for. Unfortunately I cannot get the three hours of my life taken away by this film. Do not watch this.At a great probability, an atrocious waste of money went into making this because I couldn't help but question where it all went. It probably went into a black hole. Common sense was extremely uncommon in the entire film and to an extent that would actually anger you, making you wonder how stupid the director thinks of you otherwise. Like plenty others, I felt a necessary urge to be informant about this tragedy and so created an IMDb account just to write this. Not surprisingly, I found that a lot of others have already said most of what I wanted to say about the film.I'm going to try to sum up some scenes, shortened to the best of my ability that would give you an idea of how awful this movie really was and how dreadful my time went sitting through it all hoping to find a little substance somewhere down the line, being a patient guy. On the real this movie is not even worth your 10 dollars on a DVD rental. You'd probably sleep through all of it in any case.So I spend twenty dollars to go see this and upon the first ten minutes I find myself looking back at my life wondering where I had gone wrong to deserve this. To begin with, the start of this film with Mathew McConaughey on some unknown farmland somewhere and who knows where, does not create any picture or lead you anywhere for you to even develop one on your own, to get a hold of whether an 'Interstellar' will actually begin to unfold or whether not. Our lead, with his kids drives his truck off road down on to fields of corn ( with a flat tire ) to follow what seems to be some ""Nasa test drone/ robot plane"", as soon as he spots it randomly flying in the air. So he drives with his kids for say over twenty minutes with the flat as his car runs down heavy bushes of corn fields, where he commands his kid son to ""take the wheel"" while he moves in the backseat now to turn on his laptop through which he has decided to and even knows how to track this drone! From this point on I tried hard to stay awake. He later just happens to stumble upon a Nasa base that also happens to be only minutes away from where he lives. I steady awake to the part where our hero gets out the car outside the Nasa base with blinding lights in front of him. Next, he gets whacked by a robot, taken hostage and then wakes up in front of Anne Hathaway, inside the base. Then you've got Michael Caine telling him that he is ""the chosen one"" to fly a rocket in spite of the fact that Matthew mistakenly discovered the base. After exchanging a few words, our hero seems fit to be the pilot of the rocket ship ( without real training ) for a mission everybody is newly introduced to. What is this mission about? To go find another planet that would sustain life because Earth is no longer going to be a hospitable place in a few years although no one knows why. That is not it. Guess where they're all going to look for one? In a black hole. Forty minutes deep and you'll find that by now you'd rather walk out because it doesn't really matter anymore how the film turns out. Later nearing the end, McConaughey's ship is about to run out of fuel any minute where the ship explodes at full capacity leaving him to fall into the black hole to find himself in a five dimensional wall space. Here he communicates to Earth with the assistance of the robot that should've been destroyed in that ship, to his daughter through a wrist watch lying on her bedroom shelf at home and she happens to sense what is exactly going on Wow this was just terrible. Now, to all those of you who have the slightest idea of what a black hole is and what it does or doesn't do for that matter, do not waste your time watching this even on DVD. In fact, make sure you do not waste your hours even watching it for free on television shortly soon because it would make you so sad, scared and bored all at the same time like you couldn't believe.Not one minute of this film was ""possible"" if you like, even bit by bit, to create any practical sense of what went on or even what could have come out of it.This movie was so bad I came out paralyzed. To my horror, I'm left with no words to describe the experience and I'm only trying.I consider myself pretty tough after having the courage to sit entirely through and not walk out within the first twenty minutes like I should have done."
"Review of Interstellar : This has got to be the stupidest, most absurd, ridiculous movie I have ever seen in my life. There are so many ludicrous, illogical leaps in this movie that it would take days to mention them all, days. Nothing made sense from a logical standpoint in the entire film. Not one thing. Absolutely nothing in the script worked. Every aspect of it was so ludicrous that I was rolling my eyes, throwing up my hands or even laughing out loud throughout the whole thing. Masterpiece my ass. And the comparisons to 2001, give me a break. If you think this film is thought provoking you have an IQ of less than zero. A total waste of the 70mm film it was shot on."
"Review of Interstellar : I'll try to be as objective as possible here, but unlike the premise of this film, you won't be able to travel through a wormhole and warn yourself of the impending waste of three hours.First, I'm not a SciFi fan, but rather (was) a Nolan fan, so I did want to give this film a chance. I don't claim to be a film expert by any stretch, but this movie reminded me of a similar experience with The Thin Red Line (1998) in that the entire film was a play on visual that subsequently lacked substance. Further, the visuals in this film were extremely boring! It's outer space, throw in something to look at, even if outside of textbook physics. With the exception of the black holes, it's literally black the entire time (or a Saturn backdrop)! They also poured in some heavy scores to make an attempt to glamorize the visual effects (or lack thereof).So Earth is dying, but they really never get into the why's and how's in an understandable fashion that would help to put into perspective the importance of finding another planet to live on. Life on earth seems to continue for decades after they start their mission, which only exemplifies my point. Unless Einstein himself wrote this script, the dialogue in this film is meant to be so over-the-top that nobody in the audience is meant to understand it, nor question it.I had an issue with the character development and lack of justifiable emotion. At no point in the film do you really care about any of characters because the storyline goes around like a hula-hoop. Good actors can't make up for their own lack of character development. Sure, Cooper cries when leaving his daughter, but he is on a spaceship up in outer space before his daughter can grab a tissue to wipe the tears away.I think what bothered me most, and fits the theme for lack of visual effort, were the stupid robots!!! They are basically chrome ATM machines with block appendages! If I was going to cram a bunch of people, and adequate supplies, into a spaceship, I wouldn't design the robotic assistance to be a huge box that takes up half of the cockpit! Pure visual laziness...R2-D2 was more interesting while being created 30 years ago. The more I write and think about this movie, the more I'm reminded of how awful it was. This to me was Hollywood hyping something up and ripping off movie goer's time and money!"
"Review of Interstellar : Like many other reviewers, I'm giving this a 1 in a feeble attempt to balance out all the unwarranted 10s I keep seeing, even though I really think it deserves a 5, or maybe a 6. I actually created an account just to do this, so I figured I might as well include a review along with my rating.Many will say try to tell you that you shouldn't attempt to compare this movie to 2001, that they are two totally different movies, etc. This is ridiculous; they are quite similar on multiple levels, with Interstellar obviously taking many cues and inspirations from Kubrick's masterpiece. I feel that if we compare the two, we can get a good idea of where Nolan's film went wrong. The main reason 2001 has remained so powerful and held up so well is that it doesn't try to explain and rationalize everything that happens. We see the events of the movie unfold, but as the movie nears its psychedelic conclusion, we are really left to our own guesswork as to what is going on. Has he entered another dimension? An alternate universe? An alien spacecraft? Is he just dead? The mere fact that we have no idea whether this scene depicts something spiritual, something scientifically quantifiable, or a mix of the two makes it so much more moving than if Kubrick had tried to explain it through the available science of his time.Interstellar answers far too many questions, which, as is often the case, ends up raising infinitely more. Nolan makes it clear from the get go that this film is supposed to function on more of an emotional level than a scientific one. Then why even bother have the film ""fact checked"" by a astrophysicist? Why create this confusing mixture of real- and pseudo- science in the first place? To me, in a lot of scenes this kind of shatters the air of mysticism Nolan seemed to be going for. The ""floating bookcase in a black hole"" sequence, for instance, seemed really magical until Cooper suddenly has a bunch of epiphanies and becomes positive that the structure was created by future humans, not aliens, that they created it specifically for him so he could navigate 5D and communicate with his daughter, and that he can save the world only by manipulating a watch with gravity. BOOM. There goes all the mystery. And lets assume his theory is correct, and this structure was indeed constructed by mankind from the future. Hmmm, guess it turns out that we didn't perish from constant dust storms after all—instead we survived hundreds of thousands of years into the future and went on to create mind-blowing, interdimensional space technology. Then what exactly is future us so worried about? They seem to be doing just fine without any alteration of the past. This is just the tip of the iceberg as far as far as all of the inconsistencies and unanswered questions you'll find in this movie. If you have a very analytical mind, steer clear of it—I am not a mathy or science-y person by any stretch, yet even I struggled at times to put my logic in the backseat and just enjoy the ride.That's what I'd advise you to do if you want to have a good time watching this movie: DON'T OVERTHINK IT. If you can just do that, you'll find an entertaining film with truly stunning visual effects, a great (if maybe a LITTLE too over the top) score from HZ, and very convincing performances from the actors. I found some scenes very moving. I liked the concept of a future that, as a result of a technological lull, doesn't look very different from our present. There are a lot of positive things to say about this film, and yet the end result is, sadly, maybe just a couple pegs above mediocre."

"Review of Interstellar : speaking English in different accents? you got the widower father speaking with a southern Texan accent, then the father-in-law speaking in another, while the daughter and the son both in a total different accent? if you wife died young when your two kids were still young, they would have to grow up with the father, they would have to learn the way of speaking like their father's, or if they grew up with their grand-father-in-law, they would have to learn their way of speaking from their grand-daddy. but the movie was cast and signed up with different actors, old, adult and teenager, they came from different parts of the country, they speak the same language but in different accents. so when you assembled a group of people to play as a family, the way of speaking of every member in the family should at least sounded similar. yet Matthew McConaughey, the leading character, speaking the dialog in pure Texan accent, his two kids speaking the generic English like most Americans do nowadays. so unless both kids grew up in boarding schools, learning the language from different people, they should at least get some tone or accent from their father, but there was nothing like that. there was no consistency at all, albeit the logic.McConaughey'a Texan accent really turned me off every time when i watch him in movies that all the characters around him speaking English in similar accent while he just speaking his mother's tone. i really don't know why he would consider losing lot of weight to play the role in 'dallas buyers club', but never considered to adjust his Texas accent in many other movies. there are two guys when they speak in documentary film or regular movies, they just made me feel very uncomfortable, McConaughery is one, the other is Huell Howser, and the latter is even worse, visiting all the California places with ear-sore exaggerated southern accent, looked completely out of place.McConaughey is a very good actor, but unless he could make himself very conscious how to speak the dialog in different movies with different genres, environments, backgrounds, surroundings, and neighborhoods, but only lazily maintains his a bit exaggerated self-loving Narcissus Texan accent, almost out of place all the time, he would never be a really great actor."
"Review of Interstellar : There is no better way to start this review but to say Interstellar is a disposable, useless undertaking of cinema that boldly challenges our endeavor for science but neglects the nature of pure cinema. Interstellar is the opposite of a masterpiece. It bombards you with loads of scientific exposition whilst it hides its story filled with plot holes and lazily written screenplay."
"Review of Interstellar : Good film, it is really fantastick movie. it is about dead of earth and people must find another planet"
"Review of Interstellar : From one of the most vaunted filmmakers of our time, comes another intellectually challenging flick about space exploration, filled with notions of physics that are not known to mankind yet. I'm not one of those fanatic Nolan fans who love anything he may throw at them, and I am one of the very few who felt Inception was ridiculous. And yet, Interstellar is one of the best movies I have ever watched.In the near future, a blight that survives on nitrogen starts destroying all the crops and our Earth is no more an inhabitable planet. Humans have no choice but to look to the stars for other places for survival. Our hero, who is a former pilot and now a farmer, sets out on this quest with a team of astronauts, leaving behind his family.The Bad:
The first half doesn't feel like a Nolan movie. The panache that appears in his other works, especially the sense of seriousness and hurry, is surprisingly missing. There are long conversations without any background music, that makes you wonder why music composer, Hans Zimmer, who usually goes for the fast beats, has toned down the music so drastically. Parts of the movie feel maudlin, with arguments like ""love is the one thing that transcends space and time"", but the script makes sure that there is someone to counter such arguments with more rational ones, even if the movie doesn't agree with them. The one problem that always existed in Nolan's scripts continues to fester here: characters explaining the plot and the rules to each other, in order to let audience know, even if its obvious that they shouldn't need to explain it to each other. Since this is a movie with esoteric physics concepts at its core, there is a lot of mutual explanation between scientists that doesn't make much sense.The Good:
It does not suffer from one of the biggest problems I feared it would: logical errors. Even though it may seem a little far-fetched, the logic seems sound. Einstein's theories of relativity are extensively exploited, and at times these concepts even elicit emotional responses. The movie also ventures into more opaque fields of theoretical physics, which pique your curiosity to learn more after watching the movie. There are moments such as the spacecraft leaving earth where the music and direction couldn't have been any better. The second half is as gripping as it gets, with scenes interleaving between different spaces and timelines, with numerous challenging but well-crafted scenes, stunning visuals, riveting music, and a couple breathtaking revelations. The robot TARS, with its bare minimum appearance, adds just the right amount of levity to several moments of otherwise monotonous dialogues in the first half. This is one of those movies where every aspect of the film has to be crafted perfectly and put together beautifully in order for it to work and Nolan is just the man for the job. From Hans Zimmer's music to Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography to Matthew McConaughey's acting, there is a perfect conflation of skills to make the movie what it is.Although people do a lot of nitpicking when it comes to Nolan's movies, the plot of this movie, is scientifically possible, even though highly improbable, and the logic is irreproachable. I've had to ponder for a while to make sense of it all but that's what makes the movie so great, that it leaves you thinking about it long after its over. I will give it a 9 on 10. Must watch.Rating: 9/10"
"Review of Interstellar : «Interstellar» is an epic science fiction film co-written, directed, and produced by Christopher Nolan which was released in 2014.It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, and Michael Caine.The film immediately received glowing reviews from film critics, high ratings from the audience and is still considered one of the
best in this genre. Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology and winner of the 2017 Nobel Prize
in Physics, served as an executive producer. Interstellar has been praised by astronomers for its scientific accuracy and portrayal
of theoretical astrophysics. It was nominated for five awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning Best Visual Effects, and received
numerous other accolades.The catostrophic future. Almost all food resources have been depleted and humanity is on the verge of extinction. The main character -
a caring father and an experienced pilot - was chosen by fate to try to save the world. After discovering the secret base of NASA
researchers, he was offered to plunge into the unknown - to go through the universe in search of a planet suitable for human habitation.But for the sake of the result, the hero will have to sacrifice a lot. Throughout the story, Nolan raises serious questions that make
viewers think. Leave your children for the chance of their further bright future or spend the last days being with them? The film
literally draws the viewer in from the first minutes.Despite the 3-hour length, the film is watched at one breath. The sound track written by Hans Zimmer is perfect for extremely
breathtaking landscapes on different planets and fascinating flights through space. The story created by Christopher Nolan makes
you empathize and brings the emotions of the main characters to the audience. Thanks to the activities of many physicists and
astronomers, the film quite accurately conveys its scientific component. It is the combination of all these factors that, in my opinion,
led the film to such success.To sum up, I can say that «Interstellar» is that kind of film that takes us to a special world beyond imagination.More than that, it is the movie that you want to watch over and over again and every time it won't leave you indifferent.Definitely, «Interstellar» is worth watching, especially if you are a fan of this genre."

The world has falle victim to famine caused by overpopulation and a blight that is killed crops and creating massive dust storms.with nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere totalasphyxiation is the inevitable endgame. Earth as an bastion of humanity is doomed former NAZA engineer and test pilot coper owns acres of corn that he farm along with his family: son tom daughter murph and father in law donald.

The second involve using frozen embyos to colonize a distant world. There are problem with plan A - namely overcoming gravity to launch the massive space ship. But brand is convinced he can solve the necessary equation thag will make the possible. This is the movie that victim to famine caused by overpopulation and a blight that is killing crops and creating massive dust storm.

But i think this movie is the best sci-fi I ever seen so far."
"Review of Interstellar : ""Interstellar"" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of traditional science fiction.

"Review of Interstellar : I had the pleasure of watching Christopher Nolan's Interstellar recently and was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this movie. At its core, this film is about the human race trying to find a new place to inhabit due to the deteriorating conditions on Earth. Time is of the essence to find a new home because crops are failing and sooner than later the human species could become extinct. The hero in this film is Joe Cooper who is played by Matthew McConaughey. Cooper is a former NASA pilot turned farmer after NASA became no more because it was said that taking care of Earth was more important that space exploration. Through an interesting series of events, Cooper finds what is left of NASA and is asked to go on a mission to save humanity. The driving force for Cooper to take on this mission is for the love of his family and for his love of humanity. This common thread is seen throughout the movie and often times drives Cooper to push himself past his perceived limits to accomplish what needs to be done. This theme of movie is summed up by this line ""Love is the one thing that we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space."" (2014). Love truly is one of those things that can transcend many things and its ability to do so is seen throughout this film.Some supporting characters in this film are Amelia Brand played by Anne Hathaway and Professor Brand played by Michael Caine. Amelia is the daughter of Professor Brand and is chosen to go on this mission because of her background in biology. These two characters helped with the story and some of the things that they did during the film made for some interesting twists. The use of lighting in this movie was done well in my opinion. There were a few scenes that were serious and the darker lighting helped to amplify the mood that was being conveyed. During a few of the scenes where there was a lighter mood, the lighting was a bit brighter helping to show the joy in the moment. This was an excellent film that provoked many thoughts with its complex theories and exciting scenes that will put you on the edge of your seat. From heart-wrenching scenes to fast paced action, this movie has it all. At the end of the film, you will be glad you watched this film as I believe that this one is a classic and is in the top 5 of my sci-fi movie list."
Review of Interstellar : It was kinda good movie but it just didn't need 2h and 49m
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar represents more of the thrilling, thought-provoking, and visually resplendent filmmaking moviegoers have come to expect from writer-director Christopher Nolan, even if its intellectual reach somewhat exceeds its grasp."
Review of Interstellar : Interstellar is a grim what if question. What if The Earth stopped sustaining us? And we as a species faced extinction on a massive scale. and there was no way out ? Or what if there was ? would you take it ? despite the risk in never seeing your kids again? That is Christopher Nolan's Interstellar in a nutshell. Its the end of the 21st century. the Earth is dying and everyone on earth is forced to become farmers in order to survive. No more explorations no more NASA no more inventions or old ones for that matter. Everything is just turned to one end massive farming. But the earth is not co operating .Giant dust storms and earth wide famine is slowly killing off the planet. Where once there was Billions of people there may only be millions or thousands struggling to survive. Cooper is a rare breed a former test pilot for NASA he was the last great pilot to fly a rocket ship until the government shut it down to force funds into farming. Now the Earth is Dying and NASA has been restarted in secret to investigate a wormhole near Saturn that opens a gateway to 12 possible new homes. The only problem is time is running out. NASA tells Cooper they did send out 12 expeditions and now it will be up to Cooper and his team to determine which planet is the one The only trouble is they only have time to explore three and gather data. but which three and will they make it back in Earth in time ?Nolan has never written better nor has he ever directed anything better then this . Interstellar is a spectacular movie that deserves to be seen more then once. It explores ideas that has rarely looked at before. And according to the press releases . the science in this movie is accurate so it sounds very believable going into it. The acting is very god the leads are all exceptional and make this a memorable film.
"Review of Interstellar : For me, interstellar is one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. The plot, the cast, the special effects..everything about it is incredible. I can't really explain the movie because it has a strange plot. It is a film that tells the world we live in is getting worse and that if it continues like this, there will be no life in the world. A group of astronauts go to space for Saturn to move the world into the saturn. And in the movie, he also explained his difference during his time in space. The separation of a father and his dougther was also the emotional side of the movie. Although it is a science fiction movie, it made the audience experience every emotion.

"Review of Interstellar : If you have plenty of time, this is a movie you should never miss!"
Review of Interstellar : Everytime I watch this movie I notice things that I never noticed before.
"Review of Interstellar : Is a movie about the Hero's journey and is incredible how the movie every moment makes you feel like your travel.The tireless life searching in other planets has been a humanity dream; this sci-fi movie explain how could be one of these moments when the humans come out from the earth in search of life in another planet, but this action can contain some problems, well the life in the earth has been harder the last years with the contamination, famines, human apathy, government lies... those are actual problems, but in the movie are exaggerated. One day Cooper intercepts a government drone, well he hadn´t years without see something like this and with his knowledges, intercepts it and obtain an information, when he came back to his house, there was some strange, he found a coordinates, come to them and he found a secret government place where they has investigating about a possible travel in search of life in another galaxy, Cooper was astronaut in the past and he was impacted, the government convinces him to travel, well he was a very great astronaut but when the government had to reduce the investment in the science, Cooper was devoted to farmer, finally he decided to travel even with her 11 years old Murph disagree, well this travel could finish bad, and with a mixture of relativity when he reach another galaxy, the Murph time pass faster than her father; finally he travel with an expedition, they found so many problems, make mistakes that can cost a lot of time in the earth who depend of their investigation well the planet every day are more dangerous.Finally, Cooper falls in Gargantua (a black hole) for help his team, and they could come back to earth without good results but is in Gargantua where a lot of problems are solucionated with a hard to understand physics, mixing relativity, space-time, another dimensions, and Cooper achieves to help resolve a paradox so that the humanity could go out from the earth well the life was been impossible, when this happens the humanity leave the earth and Cooper is found close to a planet alone, without starship, they pick it up in a other starship that contain the humanity, he achieves survive in a ""Cooper station"", but he believed that was for him but really was for her daughter, who resolve everything, and is crazy when he goes to her and note that one travel in another galaxy significate to her daughter more than sixty years."
"Review of Interstellar : If this is not in your Top 100 favorite movies of all time, you should hang your head in shame.Every Christopher Nolan movie I've seen so far has made that list. So could be the case with you. Certainly, there are plenty of 'Nolanisms' (idiosyncrasies Director Christopher Nolan adds to most of his movies that few understand absolutely) but that's what I personally like about Nolan's movies. They make you pay attention, think differently, and be introspective. Interstellar is nearly 3- hours (!) of non-stop story telling, and nearly non-stop-Nolanisms, with twists and complicated theories about time travel and relativity and scientific mumbo- jumbo. It's told so well I actually I believe it! In fact, if Nolan were a doomsayer building a spaceship to take me to another planet when the world ends (ie Trump's reelection) I'd sign over my bank accounts and wife right now (ok, maybe not my bank accounts). That's how convincing Interstellar is.Even if none of the theory told here is ever proved, Nolan sure makes a good case for interstellar travel. But I digress. This isn't 'just' a movie for science geeks. I'm sort of a geek, but I'm an idiot and much of the 4th, and now apparently 5th dimension gobbledy gook is way over my inflated head (I still need a calculator for simple equations). But, there is also great story about love and sacrifice and family. On one hand, not having a family myself, I can understand the yearning for wanting to go away and explore space for 50+ Earth years. However, I can also understand the basic need for human interaction and the unconditional love and forgiveness one's family can bring. Having to choose between one or the other is not easy and that's exactly what McConaughey's character must do (although he seems to choose which with very little indecisiveness).There's so much more to this complex movie it's one you may need (want) to see more than once to 'get'. It's in my Top 25 so viewing it again and again is not going to be foreign to me."
"Review of Interstellar : All of Christopher Nolan's films are obsessed with the mind. Memento is a fascinating exploration of memory, The Prestige is all about the mind being tricked, and of course Inception deals with dreams and the subconscious. What theme does Nolan tackle in Interstellar's three bold, ambitious hours? Surprisingly for a director often accused of being emotionally cold - maybe because - it's about love, the love for family and how it affects a parent. But it's also about the most fundamental human instinct, one that will always be entangled in family; the will to survive. Against the breathtaking backdrop of space, this is an intensely cinematic experience, flawed and sometimes frustrating, but engrossing all the way through. In a dusty future Earth ravaged by blight and rapidly running out of food, humanity has, in the words of Matthew McConaughey's Cooper, stopped looking up at the stars to look down at the dirt. But there's salvation in the form of a wormhole that has opened near Saturn. Planets capable of supporting life lie on the other side. Cooper and a team of astronauts are now humanity's only hope for survival; go through the wormhole, find us a new home, and report back. The pressure is time. We will probably only survive two more generations on Earth, and relativity means that hours on the other side of the wormhole could mean years on Earth. This is an ingenious plot device to create tension in every action sequence. It's a similar concept to the dream-within-dream time scales in Inception, but whereas that came from Nolan's imagination, this is fiercely rooted in real science. The film visualises wormholes and black holes unlike anything before it, with the help of physicist Kip Thorne, and the effect is stunning. It lingers on the beauty of space, the endless darkness and the spaceships spinning through it covered in shadows. It demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible. My favourite part of the movie comes when the ship is on the two year trip to the wormhole; Cooper offers an astronaut headphones that are simply playing the sounds of nature. We see the Endurance floating serenely next to the rings of Saturn, accompanied by rain, distant thunder and the chirping of crickets. It's beautiful. I mentioned earlier Nolan's often-criticised coldness, and the struggle audiences have in emotionally connecting to his characters. It seems like he's almost consciously reacting against this in Interstellar, with the father-daughter relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murphy - played by three great actresses at different points in her life - the central point of the film. Cooper is torn between leaving his family behind and ensuring their survival for the future. The urge to survive wills the crew of the Endurance to finish their mission, but Cooper is driven by a desire to return to Earth and keep the promise he made to his little girl. At times this works wonderfully well, and swells to a powerful, dimension-breaking climax, but thinking about it Nolan still shows some struggle with the emotional side of his stories. Cooper's agreement to take on the mission seems far too quick given how much he comes to miss his children; there needed to be more of an emotional conflict before the decision to go, and it was lacking. As his relationship with Murphy takes on greater plot significance his son Tom gets lost in the mix; the brilliant Casey Affleck is underused as the adult version of the character. The main barrier between Nolan and emotion is simply the unrelenting epic scale of his films; this is the fourth $100m+ 2.5hr+ film he's done in a row. He really needs a break, a middle budget film with a vibe more like The Prestige. What's also frustrating about the movie is that it suffers from what the main flaw in Inception, which is Nolan's clunky grasp of exposition. While a great deal of it is necessary to explain the complex plot, the way it's worked into the dialogue is grating. Right at the beginning, Murphy's teacher tells Cooper, a farmer in a rapidly starving world, that the world needs farmers because we ran out of food. When the wormhole is just about to be approached, after a two year voyage, an astronaut decides it's finally the time to explain what a wormhole is. Moments like this just take you out of the film and it's a shame that the intelligence of the plot is occasionally let down by stupid dialogue. But then, of course, another astounding image hits the screen and we forget all about the film's problems.I think critics have been somewhat harsh on this, with only 73% on Rotten Tomatoes as I write this. Perhaps coming in with expectations too high or a desire not to follow the Christopher Nolan circlejerk, people are approaching it too analytically - too scientifically. I just love that this kind of film is getting made in mainstream Hollywood, original and intelligent and full of imagination and respectful to its audience. Nolan fanboys may be annoying, and they may overrate him as the best director of our time, but you can't deny that he is responsible for by far the most interesting blockbusters coming out of Hollywood. I'm excited to see what wormhole he'll take us down next."
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar stars Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey (Cooper), who displays a beautiful touching act as we see countless feelings of emotions from him. His daughter played by Jessica Chastain (Murph) also plays a large part in this movie while delivering the art of her curiosity and deep thinking. Matt Damon, Timothee Chalamet, and Anne Hathaway also play large roles in this movie.The story of this movie takes place in the future and surrounds the realistic fact that our planet Earth will eventually die. A secret organization Cooper and his Daughter Murph stumble upon due to their advanced knowledge presents them with the inevitable fact that Earth is dying and they need to find a new planet."
"Review of Interstellar : If you are a Sci-Fi lover this movie is must watch movie, best science friction movie ever watched."
"Review of Interstellar : It's not that there have not been good or even great Science Fiction movies since ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", there have, but every one of them has been skewed by action, violence, sex, special effects. Good - but perhaps unbalanced. or after spending their budget on actors, special effect, plots and vision have been almost universally overlooked, not to mention humanity.November 2014, ""Interstellar"" changed all that. I started out, calloused, skeptical, not wanting to get hurt or get my hopes up, recalling the sick feeling I got in my stomach when I saw ""Prometheus"", or other movies going back ... yeah, 46 years. Despite some peculiar decisions of the universe ""Interstellar"" creates, the movie, the message, the production ... virtually everything about this movie is fantastic.This unqualifyingly is the best and most visionary movie that I have seen in years, maybe decades. It's small imperfections just steps to stand on to gain a greater vision of the Cosmic ideas it had embedded in it. This might have been the movie that Carl Sagan would have wanted ""Contact"" to be, and ""Contact"" was very good - and other movies have been very good, but somehow thankfully someone or something, maybe from the 10th dimension reached across time and space and stilled Hollywoods baser and worse instincts.Thank you, this was a truly great movie. 10/10"
"Review of Interstellar : Massive apologies for such a review as this one... (as it is short and hardly informative)This movie... all I have to say is... this. Is. The best. Movie. Anyone. Could possibly EVER. Watch.So many genres were captured in this movie and basically EVERYTHING tied up so well.I watched this movie today with a couple of friends. Halfway through the movie, a friend guessed the outcome of the tying together and was right... but, it requires mass intelligence of astronomy science and/or theorems of time and dimensions and/or space.I cannot say anymore about this masterpiece... except:Watch it. If you refuse to do so, you'll be missing the ride of your life."
"Review of Interstellar : Interstellar Film Review by Adam GonzalezWritten and Directed by Christopher Nolan (Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, The Prestige, Memento) ""Interstellar"" is about a team of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in hopes to save the human race. This epic Sci-Fi film stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Wes Bently, Michael Caine and John Lithgow.You'll be captivated by the visual intergalactic voyage coupled with the heart riveting musical score by Hans Zimmer (Pirates of the Caribbean, Dark Knight Trilogy, Lion King, Inception). But what makes this film even more impressive is how it was made. By creating real-life sets and shooting at physical locations, Nolan made Interstellar look and feel more like a NASA documentary as opposed to a computer generated movie blockbuster. He also made it a point to use little to no green-screen special effects throughout the film so that both the actors and the audience can have an authentic reaction to his story. To further solidify this apocalyptic drama, Nolan had Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist in gravitational and astrophysics, make sure that everything in the film was established on real science.Its hard to not get engulfed in this film, especially when you have such a strong cast led by McConaughey. Every role played such an integral part in the overall story and you will feel as though you have traveled to the end of the galaxy by the time your done."
"Review of Interstellar : OK - Im getting so used to dystopia that its boring. How many ways can the world be destroyed? At least Interstellar makes it a feasible demise of humanity, which just adds to the depression it pours over the viewers. Oh - not ready to shave your wrists yet? Well lets just add some serious tear jerking in the form of a loving dad about to leave his kids for another galaxy. Others have already gone into the ridiculous lack of continuity (massive dust storms followed by squeaky clean bedrooms and clothing -wtf?), but for me its just another long advert for Prozac. Oh but the happy news is once we f##k up our planet its all good - we just move to another. I think I've finally been converted to romantic comedies.......NO!!!!"
