"Review of Oppenheimer : I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end."
"Review of Oppenheimer : ""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW."
"Review of Oppenheimer : After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon."
"Review of Oppenheimer : This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'killers of the flower moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay! The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!"
Review of Oppenheimer : Speechless this movie had a very good sound design good visual that will blow your Mind and you will getting the best score in this movie and one thing you all saying this is boring? God help this movie had very good plot and story by freackin Christopher Nolan without even one Freackin CGI and yall still saying this is boring pillow and a blanket yall don't know the plot is and not focus to the story this is top 3 best Christopher Nolan MOVIE i have ever SEEEN and i think for 3 hours movie is too short for this movie i want 4 hoursss and anyway what a good plot twist in the end the acting is badaass good and the rdj deserves an Oscar for this film.
"Review of Oppenheimer : Christopher Nolan, once again, uses astonishing film techniques to embark the audience on an other worldly adventure. He brings to light the historical significance of the Manhattan project and Los Alamos through the scientific and political background of such a unique town portrayed with perfection by such actors as Cillian Murphy and Matt Damon. By using Los Alamos and New Mexico as a film location for the film, Nolan is able to portray what life would have been for Oppenheimer and other scientists with their families around the time of the Trinity test.As someone who grew up in Los Alamos, I could arguably say that Oppenheimer correctly highlights the history of the town and the creation of the atomic bomb alongside Nolan's own creative input to emphasise Oppenheimer's story.Cillian Murphy delivers such a vast and emotionally compelling role by highlighting the moral dilemma Oppenheimer himself faced and on that we deal with in todays age.For being a 3 hr plus film the pacing is incredible and an average movie goer can endure such horror, mystery, and drama all in one storyline that fills holes at the end created in the beginning."
"Review of Oppenheimer : A very neat biopic for a life story as complex as Robert Oppenheimer's. With his original back and forth filmmaking style, though I still like Interstellar better, I think this is Christopher Nolan's best work to date.The casting is great. Even for a short screen time, important characters showed up played by huge star such as Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman. The scoring is good enough even though I still think Hans Zimmer is one of major keys Nolan's movies are as good as they are (Batman, Inception, Interstellar, etc.). The ending is very powerful just like what Nolan did with The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar. It is the highlight of the movie for me."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Nolan's best film will be in the biographical style. I hope he can do something like Nolan's Inception that will be remembered decades from now, because he himself said that great physicists were used for this film to work with precision and seriousness.Particle for direct object
CGI special effects are not used in this movie. It can be said that this excites people. Anyway, this year's movie is going to be better, no doubt about it and I'm really looking forward to it.It would be great if it became the best film of this year and the best director nominee.Nolan's amazing love You so much ."
"Review of Oppenheimer : This movie is a cinematic masterpiece!The acting, storytelling, the score and visuals were just amazing in it.This movie proves that Cillian Murphy is a lead actor. The deliverance and his eye movement was a treat of it's own. I couldn't have picked a better actor to play Oppenheimer.RDJ showed us that he can still roll with the big boys of the industry and everyone was just amazing in it.This movie isn't just a story how the atomic bomb was made, but also how Oppenheimer and the entire staff of his scratched and clawed to ""victory"". As a viewer, you immediately join them on this adventure and you feel every bit of tension in this film.The trinity test was the highlight of the movie. It took my breath away and made me feel part of the crew as they saw the bomb explode in front of their eyes.If you had any doubt watching it, don't hesitate!WATCH IT IN IMAX AND I GUARANTEE YOU WILL LEAVE THE THEATER WITH THE BEST IMAX EXPERIENCE YOU'VE EVER HAD!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : This movie is an experience. The direction, cinematography and music will take you away. The performances from all the main actors are Oscar worthy. This movie will defy your expectations. Cillian Murphy is definitely Oscar's number 1 contender.Now I understand that this may not be every person's cup of tea. Some people are seriously going to this movie expecting to have a "" fun"" time. Tho movie speaks about ""probably"" the world's biggest catastrophe EVER. Some conversations are very heavy to bear but this is the world we live in and the choices humans and governments make every day.Can't wait to see Barbie next."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Imagine a fire that you brought from the heaven and you give that fire to human , and that fire is used by humans to burn this world.Oppenheimer is not an easy historical character to play, he is a historical character full of regret and guilt. However, Murphy plays this character perfectly, his eyes filled with those emotios, the way he responds to every other supporting character's utterances is simply outstanding. Even if his only response was eye movement, or a blank stare in an uncertain direction, Everything can be understood. Also, His body gestures also complement his extraordinary acting.""They won't fear it, until they understand it, the won't understand it, until they use it."" A sentence that explains the dangers of a nuclear bomb. And the way he conveyed it really looked real and as if he already understood what was going to happen.He also played Oppenheimer's flaws perfectly, He's a pretty selfish and sometimes rebellious guy. Committing adultery with a woman who is not his wife, and has feelings that are very binding with his that girl, When the woman's death, we can see that Oppenheimer was devastated.Then for the scoring, It's really amazing. First it sound so grand, The atomic bomb is a very grandiose thing, But over time the music got louder and louder, shows a very deep fear.The sound effects also produce a feeling for the audience to feel the horror of atomic bomb. The stomping of those feet against the wooden floor couldn't escape my head until now.Lastly is the cinematography, every angle is taken perfectly, the practical effects are really pleasing to the eye. The approach to Murphy's face in the final scene literally describes Oppenheimer's entire life. The explosion was also really grandiose.Christopher Nolan literally describes it all perfectly, and I have absolutely no words to compliment this man. If you want to feel Christopher Nolan's way of seeing the world, watch this film. 3 hours passed without getting bored, like only an hour.That is all from me. Thank you."
"Review of Oppenheimer : After waiting for a year and seven months, I finally watched Oppenheimer, and it was totally worth every second of anticipation! The cinematography in Oppenheimer is a visual masterpiece. Each frame is meticulously crafted, immersing the audience into the world of the story. The way the scenes are shot and the use of lighting and color contribute to the film's captivating atmosphere.The chronological timeline of the movie is a true work of art. Nolan's seamless transitions between different periods in history not only keep the narrative engaging but also provide a deeper understanding of the characters and the historical events surrounding them. It's a brilliant storytelling technique that keeps you hooked from start to finish."

"Review of Oppenheimer : I was immediately taken by Cillian Murphy's entrance as Oppenheimer and then the seriousness of the proceedings. Christopher Nolan has already proven he is a director for the ages. Actors bend over backwards to work with him even in small, one scene parts. Here Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck and Remi Malek for instance. But is Cillian Murphy who envelopes the entire journey with the kind of truth that makes the whole thing utterly compelling. I've loved Cillian Murphy since his miraculous ""Breakfast On Pluto"" Here he is is extraordinary. Extraordinary! Visually, the film is a marvel without ever falling into an effects-fest. Superb."
"Review of Oppenheimer : ""Oppenheimer"" by Christopher Nolan is a film that delves deep into the consequences of the atomic bomb, focusing on Oppenheimer's perspective. This film requires a genuine passion for physics or history to fully appreciate its subtleties and biographical content.The imagery of the various explosions, accompanied by carefully orchestrated music and sound effects, creates an intense visual and auditory experience. At times, they even evoke feelings of tension and stress, enhancing the viewer's immersion in the story.The performances by the actors are remarkable, especially Cillian Murphy's brilliant portrayal of Oppenheimer. His captivating and nuanced interpretation brings this complex character to life, while Matt Damon, in the role of General Groves, delivers a solid and convincing presence.The film skillfully explores different temporal tones, offering a non-linear narrative that adds an additional depth to the story. The smooth transitions between color and black-and-white sequences add an artistic and symbolic dimension to the overall experience. These aesthetic choices enhance the emotional impact of the narrative and clearly distinguish the different eras and events.It's worth noting that to fully appreciate this film, prior interest in the history of the atomic bomb, as well as Oppenheimer's life and work, is necessary. With a duration of three hours, the film may seem lengthy to those who are not invested in these specific subjects.The story is divided into three distinct parts, with the first two closely interconnected. The first part focuses on Oppenheimer's training as a physicist, highlighting his interactions with Heisenberg and other eminent scientists of the time. The second part centers around the creation of the atomic bomb, the tests conducted at Los Alamos, and the scientific challenges faced by the team. The final part of the film focuses on Oppenheimer's hearing, where certain high-ranking officials, envious of his accomplishments, attempt to discredit him by presenting him as a spy working for the Soviets.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a film that delves deep into the history of the atomic bomb, offering remarkable performances, impressive visuals, and complex storytelling. It is an immersive cinematic experience that reveals the moral, scientific, and historical aspects of this pivotal event in our history.Special mention goes to the fantastic Gary Oldman, who is completely unrecognizable in the role of President Truman."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Best Cinematic Movie of 2023 and OSCAR NOMINATED 2024. Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless.Star-studded cast was not just for nothing, they truly, truly delivers each character perfectly. Especially Cillian, damn, brilliant performance. I truly wish that I could watch it in IMAX 70mm, the way they originally filmed it with.It is three hours long but I highly recommend you guys to watch Oppenheimer in the best theatre you could find in your city. Yes its gonna be boring if you're just accompanying your friend or S/O without actually intended to invest your time in this."

"Review of Oppenheimer : My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet."
Review of Oppenheimer : For me this movies is the best movie in this decade and one of the best nolan movie ever seen and one of the best movies of the all time actually this movis is top 5 movie I ever seen cillian is the best and deserve oscar and oppenhimer deserve oscar for best picture and cinematography and music and moreRobert downey jr deserve oscar for best supporting actor and also matt damon is one of the best I only say this movie is masterpiece and nolan should win oscar for the best director in this year and he deserve and florence pugh deserves oscar for the best actress in this year I love this movie I won't see this movie againThank you for reading.

"Review of Oppenheimer : You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch."
"Review of Oppenheimer : As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves."
"Review of Oppenheimer : What an fantastic movie. It was the most anticipated movie (after Christopher Nolan announcement) and Nolan has delivered the gem. His direction, camera shots and sound was perfect at each and every moment. Watched it 1st day 1st show. Top notch acting by everyone and you will get to know the story of what Sir Julius Robert Oppenheimer had gone throughout the years (right from the recruitment for the project). Though he believed in himself and his intuitions that he will win not today but someday. After so many years of dedication towards the cinema Cillian Murphy has given fantabulous performance and right judge for the role."
"Review of Oppenheimer : ""Oppenheimer,"" a thought-provoking documentary, delves into the intricate life and enduring legacy of a key figure in the scientific world. The film seamlessly combines historical footage, interviews, and dramatized scenes to paint a nuanced picture of the individual at the center of the atomic age.Structured chronologically, the documentary takes the audience through the formative years of the scientist, tracing the trajectory of his career against the backdrop of a world engulfed in geopolitical tensions. The film effectively captures the moral quandaries faced by the scientific community during the development of the atomic bomb, shedding light on the complex interplay between intellect, ambition, and ethical responsibility.The casting choices contribute to the documentary's authenticity, with the lead actor delivering a compelling portrayal of the central figure. The supporting cast further enhances the narrative, embodying key historical figures and providing a well-rounded view of the socio-political context.Visually, the film is a triumph, seamlessly blending archival footage with carefully crafted reenactments. The attention to period details in cinematography and production design transports viewers to the era, immersing them in the scientific and political landscape of the time.While the documentary excels in its comprehensive exploration of the scientific and geopolitical aspects, some may find the pacing a bit slow, particularly during in-depth scientific explanations. Additionally, a more profound exploration of the personal life of the central figure and a deeper examination of the aftermath of the atomic bombings could have added further dimensions to the narrative.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a well-executed documentary that invites audiences to contemplate the complexities surrounding scientific innovation, moral responsibility, and the far-reaching consequences of groundbreaking discoveries. Without delving into specific names, the film remains a captivating exploration of the human side of scientific achievement, leaving viewers with a lingering contemplation of the ethical implications of technological advancements in the context of war."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Anything that Nolan is involved in, I will go and see, the track record is enough to get me through the doors and on that seat.Oppenheimer represented something of a challenge to me the first time round, after a busy day at work, I went to see it, and at three hours long, after Barbie, it was too much, last night I watched it properly for the second time.As a casual viewer, it's a tough one, but if you're engaged and prepared, this is one outstanding movie. I am on no doubt whatsoever that this film will do very well in terms of awards, the whole cinema was totally immersed, the room was silent.The pacing builds as the film progresses, the second half was the best part, and I loved the ending.It gives some fascinating insight into the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Waited three hours for an explosion and it was probably the most disappointing part of the film.Otherwise, a great movie with a great cast that will be talked about for decades.So glad that I am alive to watch Christopher Nolan in his prime still and glad that I am living in the return of cinema.Easily up there with the best film of the year, will definitely be winning an Oscar.(This is here to fill the required characters, This is here to fill the required characters, This is here to fill the required characters, This is here to fill the required characters, This is here to fill the required characters)"
"Review of Oppenheimer : In my opinion, films exist not only to educate people and to teach and remember history so that we don't make the same mistakes again and again. In my opinion, films exist to entertain people and give them a unique experience.This film was an emotional roller coaster, and I have rarely experienced such truly outstanding moments.Visually, sound-wise and historically, Oppenheimer is a milestone in cinema history and had me pressed into my seat from start to finish, even my watch often informed me that my pulse was beating at over 140BPM, So pay attention to your breathing because this film will literally take your breath away in one scene or another."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I don't know what to say about this film, but it was amazing!!! I had several emotions going on in me watching this. One moment I was shocked, other moment excited, the other angry, and some moment sad and disappointed. I can't really talk about how incredibly wonderful it was. The saddest part about the movie, was that you knew you're literally watching the reality in a movie:(
basically, it's about Robert Oppenheimer who invented the atomic bomb and made it with the help of other scientists.NOTE: it's better to learn a little about history of world was II before starting to watch this. I decided to do that because in that case it was easier to imagine how was the situation back then."
"Review of Oppenheimer : As to not raise expectations this movie sucks, watch it anyway.Historians, PS majors, Americans in general, amazing an a must see.Nolan at his finest.Not as hard to follow as it may seem just keep watching. Movie of the year for me so far, not even close.Don't let the running time dissuade you, before you know it, it'll be over leaving you wanting more.The forethought of Oppenheimer as it pertains to history is incredible for a scientist.I wish I had seen it on the big screen but the running time did dissuade me so on an off Sat. For college football my wife & I threw $20 at Prime to see it at home.Best $20 I've spent this holiday season.Check it out..."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Greetings again from the darkness. As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening.Prepare yourself. At a full three hours in length, Nolan's film is a hefty undertaking for viewers. It demands full focus and attention to details and nuance, as you spend significant time listening to brilliant men talk amongst themselves. Nolan adapted the screenplay from the 2005 biography, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer"", written by Kai Bird and Martin Sherman. The end result is a film centered on complex physics and mathematics, yet presented in a simplified manner such that it's much more a character study than a science class. The key is what characters say to each other, how they say it, and how they debate and rationalize the morality of the objective ... building a bomb designed to kill people.The morality of The Manhattan Project is under the microscope here, as is the motivation and concern of Oppenheimer. We get some early background establishing him as an upcoming mind in the world of physics from his academic stops around the globe. Some know Cillian Murphy from ""Peaky Blinders"" or as Scarecrow in Nolan's Batman movies. I'd also recommend a couple of Murphy's underrated gems: FREE FIRE (2016) and RED EYE (2005). It's hard to overstate how spot on Murphy is as Oppenheimer. He lost weight for the role and captures the distinctive movements and speech patterns, as well as the familiar poses and deep-in-thought eyes. We never once question whether this is Oppenheimer, the leader of the science team at the Los Alamos Lab and the Father of the Atomic bomb ... the one who ""sees beyond the world we live in.""
Once Major Groves (Oscar winner Matt Damon) recruits Oppenheimer to run and assemble the great scientific minds, the obvious question to those involved is ... even if we can create this bomb, should we do it? This weighs heavily on Oppenheimer - a man so engulfed by science that his haunting visions are that of atoms and particles and experimental reactions (perhaps a bit too heavy in the first act). Groves is the military leader of the project and the liaison between the scientists, the military, and the government. It's also clear that while Oppenheimer's brilliance is recognized and necessary to the project, almost no one outside of the scientists trusts him. This is where antisemitism and fears of communism arise. Oppenheimer was Jewish and, though he never joined the communist party, was associated with many who did. This included his love interest, Psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (the fabulous rising star Florence Pugh), his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold).The teamwork and stress involved with building the bomb in Los Alamos is conveyed as rooms full of brilliant minds determine the future path of the country and the world. This culminates in the stunning sequence of The Trinity Test near Alamogordo. A blending of complete silence, along with spectacular sound and light, is truly a technical highlight of the film. The initial celebration of success initially overshadows the true meaning ... the bomb is now ready for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing two hundred thousand people and essentially ending WWII, less than four years after the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese (never mentioned here).The bombings are heard via radio news reports, and it's at this point where the weight of what the scientists have done is fully realized. Oppenheimer became a national hero and his Time Magazine cover proves it. A meeting with President Harry S Truman (Oscar winner Gary Oldman sporting a Missouri accent) doesn't go well, as Oppenheimer is introduced to political gamesmanship, something he would face even more directly in the near future. Lewis Strauss (Oscar winner Robert Downey Jr) is a key player as chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, and through him, we witness ego, ambition, and petty behavior that leads to a level of vindictiveness typically only seen at the junior high level.Multiple timelines are covered. There is the background information on Oppenheimer's early years, his well-rounded academia, his love life (lives), his building of the Los Alamos lab team, the overseeing of the bomb development, his time as a hero, the later backroom kangaroo court designed to disgrace him, and Strauss' Senate Confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce. All of these tie together, and it's those final two that make up the last act of the film - giving us a taste of just how nasty politics was 70 years ago (not unlike these days).Nolan has assembled a deep cast with numerous Oscar winners and a roster of talented actors. Among the familiar faces not already named above are: Oscar winner Kenneth Branagh as Danish Physicist Neils Bohr, Oscar winner Rami Malek as experimental physicist David Hill, Oscar winner Casey Affleck as Military security advisor Boris Pash, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Benny Safdie, Dane DeHaan, Jason Clarke, Josh Hartnett, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, Scott Grimes, Tony Goldwyn, James D'Arcy, James Urbaniak, Olivia Thirlby, James Remar, and (Nolan regular) David Dastmalchian.The film is a historical biopic and also an unconventional thriller. Is this about unparalleled advancement in science or is it about the moral dilemma of mass destruction and death? Politics, military, ego, power, science, love, revenge, and redemption are all displayed as Oppenheimer struggles with the power he has created and the lack of power in how it's used. My favorite line in the film is aimed at Oppenheimer when someone informs him that he's now ""not just self-important, but actually important."" The stakes are clear during the test when it's stated that there is a ""near zero"" chance of destroying the world.Cillian Murphy is a shoe-in for a Best Actor nomination, and his performance mesmerizes us. It's nice to see Robert Downey Jr remind us of his true talent, and he should be rewarded with a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, in the only two substantive women roles, should both receive consideration as well. Pugh's role is limited but memorable, while Blunt shines in her best scene during the security hearing.Christopher Nolan has delivered near perfection in technical movie-making, and on top of that, the story and characters are real life, and the performances are top notch. His use of Black & White film for Strauss' perspective allows the viewer to differentiate the Oppenheimer viewpoint. Impressively, while there are some visual effects, Nolan has stated that no CGI was used in the film, and that's most evident in the relatively short closing credit roll - where we typically get dozens if not hundreds of technical experts listed. Ludwig Goransson's (Oscar winner for BLACK PANTHER) score packs an emotional punch, and Jennifer Lame's editing is excellent and vital. Lastly, cinematographer (and regular Nolan collaborator) Hoyte Van Hoytema drives home the power of smart men in a room, as well as the devastation of the bomb test. This is excellent filmmaking and a reminder that the only thing we love more than lifting new heroes onto the pedestal of worship is tearing down those same heroes with a dose of humility. These types of movies rarely get produced these days, so here's hoping enough people go back to the theater to see it to inspire more filmmakers to take a shot.Opened nationally July 21, 2023."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I wont comment on Nolan this, Nolan that. I would call this movie a masterpiece because of its humanity & complexity.Oppenheimer is shown as complex, flawed, egocentric patriot. For eg, he is attracted to pretty terrible women, which begs questions about himself. He is arrogant, a brilliant scientist, and a great salesman. He is flawed, but patriotic no matter what. That makes for a very interesting character study.There's also a lot to be said about the violence, and the willingness of groups & individuals to commit monstrous acts. I am very interested in the evil within us. American crowds cheering at the death of 100k+ civilians, women going into trance because of a powerful man wielding an unimaginable weapon of death. All righteous people, mind you. The office discussion about which Japanese cities to wipe out, distilled down to a simple list of names, with Kyoto struck off because of its historical value and honeymooning there was sweet. And ofc, the responsibility of arms control.Then there's betrayal, and the system using people as cogs, with the military squeezing the scientists then ignoring them, if not actively shutting them down. And how to live a life of service despite that, testing loyalty, values, amid the power plays of groups or individuals.Anyhow. A great study of the complexity of humanity, social systems, war, right and wrong, and our propensity for evil. Not your casual romcom, but a rewarding watch if your brain is up for it."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I entered the movie theatre expecting a great movie about the nuclear bomb and its impact on Oppenheimer, but no, it was actually about Oppenheimer and his impact on himself and the world around him.The Best biography film I have ever seen, the best Nolan movie and more importantly the best of this year.Every character is well served and all got a great drama, influence, and performances.If Cilian Murphy didn't get his Oscar this year it will be one of the greatest crimes in the history of the academy awards that exceeds the crime of not nominating Jake Gyllinhal for Best Actor on his role in Nightcrawler.RDJ didn't lie when he said that's the best film he has been in and he had his best performance too and my man made Zodiac!I was shocked by Emily blunt as I bever thought she got that performance in her.Florence Pugh's character maybe is not what I expected, she didn't get to show us her incredible performance that we used to see it as her screentime was incredibly short, and her drama isn't served so well yet so influential.I stongly recommend this movie for any film fans, and if you could attend this movie in IMax theaters u will have the best experience ever as the music pumps in your heart."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer (2023)
Yes, to paraphrase another review, this is essentially just 3 hours of people talking, albeit with a who's who of Hollywood A list actors.The pacing is incredible, and the 3 hour runtime flies by; achieved by making this less of a biopic and more of a political/ courtroom drama.I didn't expect much going in, to be honest, as based on the runtime, I'd expected a slow, plodding affair with excessive backstory. I should've known better.The only complaint I have is there wasn't much emotional weight to this film; but then again, given how much the protagonist tries to distance himself from his emotions, maybe that was the point.9.2/10, A-"
"Review of Oppenheimer : This movie was, in short, a masterpiece. The dialogue, the perfectly timed shots, it swept me off my feet. Cillian Murphy played his role to perfection, I couldn't have asked for a better performance. If I had one critique, it would be the lengthiness of the film. It was a bit long for me, and while I understand it had to be a longer film for the whole plot to unfold I felt that at the last 30 minutes or so I unfortunately got a bit exhausted at the prospect of the film continuing much longer. Though, that said, I very rarely write reviews of anything, but I felt this particular movie was more than deserving of my attention and time."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I worry about the lack of attention span with some of these viewers who rated it so low. No, this is not a Marvel Action flick. This is a quality film. It is art. You are witnessing great acting and great dialogue within a reflection history and its impact on today's time. The same people rating this movie 6 and below probably would give the same rating to movies like The Godfather. It's quite a shame how conditioned younger people have become to not appreciate real cinema that requires you to pay attention...This movie I'm sure will win an Oscar because it is deserving. The one honest critique I have with the movie is that bomb should have been a mix of practical and cgi effects to replicate the power and mass of that explosion. It was too obvious that Nolan used low angles and perspective to make that bomb ""look"" bigger than what it was. Other than that, this was a masterclass in film making and anyone with the intelligence and attention span to appreciate it will."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer is a visually stunning film which tells a slow-paced, dialog-heavy story in a delightfully complex, creative, and fast-paced way.Due to the the sensitive subject matter and the fact that it's not entirely uncommon for us Americans too be a little too bombastic about, and proud of, our military conquests and history, going in I was afraid the story might come off a little too triumphant or nationalistic. But this movie intentionally, and successfully, rides a very dichotomous line that leaves you feeling uneasy at best for much of its run time.The juxtaposition between the rooms of people cheering at great scientific achievement and the potential (and hope) for it to end not just WW2 but war *itself*, against the horrific reality of what that scientific achievement could, and eventually *would*, be used for, leaves you a bit frozen. I am, admittedly, a rather sensitive person so while I watched the characters cheer and celebrate their years of hard work as they optimistically looked forward with hope for a better future, I found myself fighting back tears having known exactly what this invention would go on to do, both physically and psychologically. The more cheering I heard, the more disturbed I felt. And as much of the theater laughed at a ""joke"" a character made about not choosing a certain Japanese city to bomb, I (and some others) sat silently and solemnly, unable to laugh. I was overcome with great sorrow as I reflected on the fact that some of the men who were making the decision to drop this bomb were making it all too lightly. As they laughed and celebrated, many of them had no real grasp of the horror they were about to rain down on real people... Cities filled with culture and history... Homes filled with moms, dads, sons, daughters, grandchildren... 200,000+ innocent civilian lives lost through no fault of their own... As the film shows, there were many people who knew exactly what was going on and who were deeply afraid, and even regretful. But history also showed us that some people remained proud and braggadocios, having never fully grasping what they had helped do even after the destruction was done. Even today I still see people posting disturbingly un-empathetic, nationalistic memes laughing at and celebrating this event that caused generations of pain for real people.Much of this movie leaves you feeling unsure about how to feel about Oppenheimer himself--which I think that is the appropriate way to feel. That dichotomy is was makes this movie so great. You want to feel happy because you love science and achievement, you want to feel joy because a horrific war was finally coming to an end for one reason or another, you want to feel sorry for Robert because you know he has to live with this creation and the psychological effects of knowing what it has done and can still do, you want Robert to get justice after what the government put him through. But at the same time you mourn for the loss of life, you mourn for the generations of fear and pain that invention would go on to cause, you reflect on if it was worth it or if it was even necessary at all, you feel anger for the people who participated knowing full well what would happen, you even feel disgust at Oppenheimer himself. You are transported to 1940 and feel a genuine fear in thinking ""well, what IF the allied nations weren't the first to come up with this technology? What IF we were beat to the punch? What IF we never used it? What would have happened?"" while also feeling the experience of what it feels like to be fully human and filled with empathy for other humans, ""but what if the war could have ended without it? And if our enemies are monsters for their disregard for innocent human life in pursuit of their goals, doesn't that make us monsters too? Doesn't an eye for an eye make the world blind?"" Whether fearful or empathetic, all are valid questions, fears, and concerns. This dichotomy and constantly feeling of being stuck between a rock and a hard place is what it means to be human. And it's in that dichotomous space that this movie lives and proves to be a masterpiece.Switching gears briefly; the music, the sound effects, the cinematography, the acting, the wardrobe, the practical effects... it's all wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. They nailed it in so many ways. And let's not forget the fact that Kitty Oppenheimer is a whole mood. Emily Blunt did a wonderful job and I found myself laughing at many of her reactions on screen thinking ""this is actually, probably, the appropriate response."" LOL. And it probably goes without saying that Cillian and Robert Downey Jr were phenomenal. Just a really good experience all in all.And if you have the immense pleasure and privilege of living near one of the 30 theaters (worldwide) that plays this in true IMAX 15perf 70mm film... GO. Seeing this in 70mm film, in 4:3 aspect ratio, on a floor-to-ceiling screen is astounding. You must see it this way if you are a cinema head."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer is truly a biographical film with a captivating narrative. The focus is on the characters, and the depiction of nuclear weapon development is minimal. The bombings are not the central theme; rather, it delves into profound introspection. The film employs a significant amount of stream of consciousness, illusions, and auditory suppression to convey Oppenheimer's deep-seated anxiety and unease towards atomic energy. The culmination of events and arguments is stunning, leaving one speechless.The explosion begins from within; time is a mere technique, a means to reach destruction. Politics and human entanglements are superficial. By approaching the biographical aspect from a thriller's perspective, the explosions become silent, ecstasy turns terrifying, and interrogations become more jarring than bombs. The 'chain reaction' may literally mean the destruction of the world, or in another sense, not the end of World War II but the beginning of the Cold War. He witnesses firsthand the deathly inferno he helped create, entwined with both trembling and boundless fascination.In the tumultuous year of 2023, with such a restless movie-watching environment, it is remarkable that a film so composed, serious, slow-paced, and detached from the audience was made with a budget of 100 million dollars. Moreover, the film manages to capture the beauty of physics in real-life shots, a feat perhaps achievable only by someone like Nolan."
"Review of Oppenheimer : This film was structured so well, suddenly the movie was over. It's so complicated, but Nolan made it all logical, even though there are 3 timelines crossing each other. Don't get me started about the acting from Cillian Murphy, which was phenomenal. The music was great. It really helped with creating that haunting feeling that Oppenheimer constantly has. I was completely lost in thoughts when I walked out of the cinema, which is the best thing a movie can do. The days after the movie, I kept thinking about it.The cinema is though the best place to watch this movie. I don't think it can have the same impact when you watch it at home. Especially because of the music and sound effects. The chairs were trembling. I didn't watch the movie in IMAX (which I'm seriously considering doing in the upcoming weeks), still the big screen made sure that the impact of the atomic bomb came across."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I mean, Nolan had to do something to get many fans back after Tenet, but Oppenheimer is even more complex and LOT more difficult to watch and understand at the same time , than Tenet.But soundtrack (however too noisy it is) is great companion to entire movie but can we all agree that very first frame is absolutely , shockingly good , abstract yet absolutely concrete... phenomenal using of rain drops. For me Nolan needs to ease off little bit and do comfort zone movie , something more ""for normal people"" , and yet you kinda wish his next film will be another complex, hard to swallow and watch masterpiece , like this on.. 8/10 is enough for me bc i am little bit disappointed with focsuing on politics rather than oppnehimer´s inner battle before and after the Trinity / Hirosima / Nagasaki - i expected more depression scenes, more fighting with himself."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Some of the things I think are good about this movie:
Nolan's approach of CGI minimalism.The awesome acting by its cast members, I especially think Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Jason Clarke as the highlights of the actingFantastic choice of B&W/color scenesHaunting and awesome score by Ludwig GöranssonThe dialogues that represent the politics, dilemmas, dissent, and scientific discussions that go behind the Trinity testBut I can't help but to feel that something feels incomplete/off about the pacing and portrayal in the movie, it feels like some scenes are too lengthy and sort of dominate other aspects of the story that should have gotten more screen time instead. I mean, don't get me wrong, this movie is awesome and it definitely immerses people into Oppenheimer's great and tragic life story and shows how important of a person he was, but it feels like there is an imbalance in the storytelling and how long things are told. It feels like considering the significance of the story of Oppenheimer, there is something that feels imbalanced in the film."
"Review of Oppenheimer : History is hardly ever as straightforward and simple as we something believe it to be. The same goes for people like J. Robert Oppenheimer. In learning about World War II and the development of the atomic bomb, the thing I remembered the most was that he was a brilliant man who was suspected of being a communist, thereby tarnishing his legacy. That however seems to be somewhat of the straightforward simple history we tend to like.Yet if this movie is as accurate as is claimed, a theorist (not just a theoretical physicist) might have an intellectual interest in leftist (specifically communist) ideas while, simultaneously, never fully committing. This was a theme touched on throughout the movie in which Oppenheimer was, in several instances, content to stick with theory.When the Trinity test then took place and he saw what came from theory being put into practice, I do believe that fundamentally changed him. Wrestling with the unleashing of such power and knowing he led the scientists responsible for it, should really change anyone with a conscience.What this picture does really well is show Oppenheimer neither as a saint who might have saved millions of lives at the cost of hundreds of thousands, nor as a sinner caught up in communism as might have been the case during the era of Joseph McCarthy and the Cold War. Rather, he was a man as brilliant as he was defiant, ordered as he was rogue, disciplines as he was cavalier. I believe Nolan, as the primary screenwriter and obviously director, respects us as the audience enough to leave it up to us to draw our own conclusions."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Pretty long film no doubt, But I had expectations because we were told by the cast and the director Christopher Nolan during the interviews, that the audience would be able to experience what destructive power an atomic bomb has just like what we can see for an explosion in Nuclear reactor visually in the show by HBO, Chernobyl.Disappointed, that nothing was shown visually, I couldn't connect with the guilt Oppenheimer had when he said, ""he feels blood on his hand"". Nevertheless, it is just a fulfilling documentary about J. Robert Oppenheimer depicted in the film, don't expect anything more."
"Review of Oppenheimer : After the hero and science fiction films by Christopher Nolan, we also watched a film in the documentary film category and with a very high artistic, thriller, psychological content. I can say that Christopher Nolan, of course, added another successful one to the works of art album. The film is not like a classic linear flowing documentary. With subjective and objective evaluations, Robert Oppenheimer's spiritual and mental dilemmas in the world of, There was a movie that told Oppenheimer's argument for building an atomic bomb. The movie is 3 hours long, but the curiosity and tempo are increasing in the last hour. This is a movie that those who expect a lot of action should not approach. The film is more of a thriller than an action, it is a film that tells about psychology, the hero's life story and the process leading to the construction of an atomic bomb. There is a reference to Prometheus. It is said that Opennheimer makes such an impression just as he stole fire from the Greek Gods. We understand Oppenheimer's psychological goings-on best in his conversation with President Truman, because he considers himself a murderer. Truman, on the other hand, says that he got blood on his hands as a user, not a doer. I do not agree with the very mixed reviews of the film. The film is perfectly understandable, but there may be hero confusion and excess. But Christopher Nolan does it on purpose it's a chaotic environment, Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar from the art community to the end with this film so that a tense environment is reflected to the audience. Is it possible for a person to describe emotional transition and internal reasoning so expressionistically? Hats off to this performance, really.1.told through a personal narrative,we see it from the point of view of Opennheimer. It's never a movie made to judge anyone or made for praise. It was a film that captured the natural flow of that period. Oppenheimer's main motivation for this project is that this bomb will end the war in a bloody way, but no one will ever have the courage to wage war again. Everyone's time this was often emphasized because he thought he would have this bomb inside. Christopher Nolan used a real bomb to revive the Trinity experiment, so there's labor involved. Let's step on the green curtain, not the money thing that brings the guy to the top. The only missing point I found was that the atomic bomb dropped on the side of Japan could have passed on the stage in 1 minute and its effect could have been shown. I guess Nolan didn't stop doing it himself, either. Even if this were the case, a more dramatic and emotional environment could have been created. I would recommend it to everyone, it was a successful movie. He has already made his name in Christopher Nolan's successful films."
"Review of Oppenheimer : This movie was good. There were some things I liked and didn't like about the movie. The things I did like about the movie were the special effects, the explosions, and the acting was really good. Another thing I liked about the movie was Robert Downey Junior's character because he is a good actor and I like his movies. Another thing I liked about the movie was that I liked how they were creating the atomic bomb.. Some things I did not like about the movie is the science stuff got confusing and you really had to watch and listen. Another thing I did not like about the movie was that it was a long movie. But overall the movie was really good if you like explosions and special effects."
"Review of Oppenheimer : One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb."
"Review of Oppenheimer : It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles."
"Review of Oppenheimer : At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in. It reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK, which I love."
"Review of Oppenheimer : As a general overview the movie has great pacing. While somewhat on the longer side the rising and falling tension along with the back and forth from case to events allows the viewer to feel constantly involved. Acting is well done on many parts and the sound effects and score genuinely enhance the feel of each scene brining the viewer to the edge of their seat and back. As a small negative side, I personally would have liked to see more visuals incorporated with explanations and development of the phsyics / science used through out the film. But all in all it is a wonderful movie worth the watch."
"Review of Oppenheimer : First off, the dialogues are actually audible, quite clear, happy that they mended this in comparison to Nolan's last outing Tenet.Secondly, a captivating story told in a even more captivating way.The acting is perhaps best of the year so far, Oscar nominations galore.I saw it on a digital IMAX screen, very pristine and filmy.Sound, cinematography and score are stand outs too.Only thing is, this film would have been a even better mini series.The run time and intense dialogues/ intrigues can be quite draining to the viewer.As a Dutchman I noticed that, Oppenheimer did not speak Dutch in the film, it sounded like an Irishman trying to speak German. Half a point deduction.Not Nolan's best but it is up there, like the bellowing smoke from a nuclear explosion.8.5/10Let's go to James Bond 007 next, Nolan!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : For every minute that passes during the 3-hour run time of the movie Oppenheimer, 1200 citizens in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki died. If you haven't got to see the movie it's worth pointing out that Oppenheimer - is not an anti nuclear movie. Nor is it a dramatic reconstruction of the devastating consequences of the use of the first nuclear bombs against the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For this, you would be better advised to seek out the superior acclaimed BBC drama documentary Hiroshima (2005.)
That film graphically dramatised what it is like to live through a Nuclear attack, millisecond by horror filled millisecond.The Oppenheimer movie pretty much sidled past that part of the horror story.Oppenheimer is a well made biopic of a man, or to be more accurate - a ghoul. A man who wilfully, along with his Los Alamos buddies, messed round with plutonium, mined from thousands of uranium mines to build a weapon that would annihilate the civilian populations of two cities and possibly one day humanity.What's good: A fast paced immersive movie into the allegedly tortured mind of the director of the Manhattan Project J. Robert Oppenheimer. His team delivered a fission bomb to the US airforce at the cost of $2 billion dollars. The lead up to and the culmination of the Trinity Test contains the movie's strongest moments.What's bad: The story of the creation of the worst imaginable weapon and the consequences of its use is virtually skimmed over in favour of the McCarthy era security hearing of Oppenheimer in 1954, which resulted in his losing his 'security clearance.'
The hearing, the movie shows, was secretly instigated by Levi Strauss, the director of the post war Atomic Energy Commission. Strauss who had taken over the Manhattan project in 1946, never got on with Oppenheimer, who apposed the development of the hydrogen bomb.While it's an interesting story, it decidedly distracts from the real horror of what happened to the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and descends - somewhat - into yet another attempt to justify the actions and subsequent hegemony of the United States. They even manage to name check JFK near the end for a little old fashioned jingoism.It's a good movie. But it would be timely for Netflix to stream When the Wind Blows (1986) and The Day After (1983) as well as the aforementioned BBC Hiroshima (2005)"
"Review of Oppenheimer : In a revelation that history books have overlooked, ""Oppenheimer"" brilliantly portrays the vital role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in ending World War II. The film delves into his profound stance on mass destruction weapons and their global impact. Once again, Christopher Nolan impresses the audience with exceptional sound mixing, cinematography, and a compelling script. Though the film begins slowly with numerous character introductions and politics, it culminates in a harmonious and thought-provoking finale. Not being a history buff myself, the movie ignited a genuine curiosity about Oppenheimer, demonstrating the power of cinema to spark interest and conversation. A special shoutout to Cillian Murphy, whose phenomenal acting brings the character to life."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The actual story needed to be told. But it would have been better a 2 hour linear docudrama, than a 3 hour mysterious storytelling adventure where the director keeps us in his thrall with his cutting, and his use of color to depict time. The science, which is actually the most important character in the story, is almost totally excluded. The scenes meant to describe fission processes, were not related to fission at all. Dark stars aren't relevant. Neither is the physics of how stars work, because stars work by fusion, and this is a story about fission. The atomic bomb was inevitable, given the continuing discoveries by nuclear physicists. A few years There was a time, shortly before the Manhattan project was funded, the we didn't know if it could work, theoretically. But that wasn't made a part of the Oppenheimer story. Churchill's refusal to share with the Russians thru into the Cold War sill are threatened by."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I recently had the opportunity to watch Oppenheimer's film, and I must say it was a rather challenging experience. The film is filled with numerous scenes that unfold at a high speed, making it difficult to catch every dialogue. This fast-paced approach, unfortunately, hindered my overall enjoyment.While the film has received positive reviews, my personal experience was not as positive as I had anticipated. The rapid pace, combined with the abundance of scenes, made it challenging to fully grasp the subtleties of the storyline and connect with the characters.The film's dialogue, crucial for understanding the narrative, often got lost in the whirlwind of scenes, leaving me longing for more clarity and coherence. Despite the hype surrounding the film, it did not live up to the expectations set by its positive reviews.Additionally, it's worth noting that the film's IMDb ranking may not fully align with my personal viewing experience. While others may appreciate the director's unique style and innovative approach, I found it to be a bit overwhelming.In conclusion, Oppenheimer's film, with its abundance of scenes and high-speed sequences, may not be everyone's cup of tea. The challenge lies in keeping up with the rapid pace without sacrificing the essence of the storyline. Perhaps, for some viewers, a second viewing might provide a deeper understanding.My Rate is 8/10 in IMDB Website but it is not my Real belief
Appreciate your time
Longing for more - Amir."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Christopher Nolan's (The Dark Knight, Tenet, Inception) latest biopic Oppenheimer follows the father of the atom bomb J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) throughout his early years as a physics student, his time as the head of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, and various other key moments in ""Oppies"" (as his friends called him) lifetime. The film explores the moral implications of the Pandora's box humanity unlocked in the New Mexico desert and Oppenheimer's struggles to come to terms with his role in fashioning the key.As a fan of other Nolan films, you may already know that his movies require one's complete attention. Nolan does not treat his viewers as if they need everything explained to them. His movies are often more cerebral than the usual popcorn flick, and this one arguably is his most intellectual by far. If you go into this movie expecting the gun fights and action of Tenet or Inception, you may be disappointed. This is a biopic, not an action movie. This is not to say that it is a bad film; on the contrary, it is a great one. Just be aware that it is more a historical drama rather than an action movie.In fact, despite its hefty three-hour run time, the film maintains Nolan's signature relentless pacing that keeps the audience engaged throughout. Even during scenes where characters are simply talking, the audience is invested. In the hands of a lesser group of filmmakers, this feat would be difficult to pull off. Here the director, the screenwriters, the score, and a huge cast of talented actors and individuals come together to make it look easy.Throughout the course of the film, we get to meet all those who impacted Oppie's life, not always for the better. There are his love interests, friends, enemies, and frenemies. Every role is played to near perfection. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is particularly impressive, as he depicts a brilliant but flawed man. The supporting cast is also noteworthy, with too many great actors to name them all. Emily Blunt portrays Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, while Matt Damon plays Leslie Groves, the military man responsible for recruiting Oppenheimer and other scientists to the Manhattan Project. Robert Downey Jr. Also makes an appearance as Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss.The film primarily focuses on the extraordinary efforts made by America to develop the atomic bomb before the Germans and Russians during World War Two and the Cold War, respectively. The editing and direction of the film are masterfully done, creating a sense of urgency that keeps the audience engaged throughout. As with all of Nolan's films, sound plays a crucial role in creating the mood and atmosphere for the audience. At times, the sound and score can be overwhelming, which is intentional as it mirrors Oppenheimer's feelings of being overwhelmed with the reality of what his efforts have brought to fruition.Summing up the entire lifetime of such a complex figure as Oppenheimer in just three hours is quite a task. However, this film is a testament to how it can be done masterfully. If you are even slightly interested in this film, I highly recommend giving it a shot. I don't think you will be disappointed."
"Review of Oppenheimer : If you have an interest in particle physics and want to see a movie about Robert J Oppenheimer, this is for you. Just know that it's 3 hours long and the best parts don't exactly happen until near the end, so you may fall asleep or get bored not too long in. The casting is perfect. I'm glad they were able to find an actor who looks just like Oppenheimer. The explosion effects were really cool though and its quite amazing they were able to do it without CGI. Honestly, my favorite part of the movie was when Josh Peck pushed the detonation button. Give it a watch if you have time, but I'll say I kinda enjoyed Barbie more."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I can't help but wonder what this movie would've looked like if it had been directed by a different filmmaker, and I believe that it probably would've been better. Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.The length is another issue. There seems to be a trend in Hollywood to tell simple and short stories over an extremely extensive period, and to tell longer and more complicated stories over a short period. This falls into the latter category. Nothing is flushed out. We jump from scene to scene with no context. Other than Oppie every character felt insignificant, including his wife and his adversary, both played by brilliant actors who are shamefully wasted here. This film could've greatly benefited from a longer runtime.It is hard not to compare this with 2014's Imitation Game and 2010's Social Network, which did a lot more character work and did good jobs at portraying emotions.Having said all that I did very much enjoy this film. Certain visual and sound effects were used to perfection, complementing the theme in a truly awesome way. Although being a massive Nolan fan and having read the book (which helps in putting scattered scenes into context) I'm sure this is somewhat biased.If this had been made by another filmmaker I would've given it a 7.Had I not read the book I would've given it a 6.But alas I give it an 8!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : Everybody involved with the production of 'Oppenheimer (2023)' is working at the highest conceivable level, practicing their craft so adeptly that it's hard to express just how impressive their efforts truly are. There isn't a weak link in the entire chain; everything is at the highest standard imaginable. The writing, the directing, the editing, the score, the cinematography, the sound design, the special effects, the costuming, the set design, the casting, and the acting - oh, the acting - is all impeccable. This film is exactly what it was always intended to be. If it doesn't clean up at the Oscars, I'll eat my shoe* or, more realistically, I'll be very surprised.However, that doesn't mean it's perfect. More specifically, it doesn't mean it moves me enough to declare it one of the best movies ever made (as so many others seem to have). It isn't even Nolan's best, although there is a good argument to be made that it's his most accomplished. Essentially, the dilemma at play here is that this is undeniably prestige filmmaking that's pretty much technically flawless, but it's just missing that intangible oomph to catapult it into any of my all-timer lists.Some of its weak points, most - if not all - of which are choices rather than mistakes, are as follows: the sound mixing, while markedly improved from 'Tenet (2020)', is balanced so it favours music and sound effects over dialogue, which is fine and dandy for the big explosion-type stuff but is sometimes irritating when it comes to the quieter dialogue-driven scenes (which take up 80% of the runtime); the editing is pretty relentless and the entire affair feels a bit like a trailer, which in turn makes the feature feel even longer than it already is (at three hours, that's not something you want) and can sometimes keep you at a bit of a distance from the narrative; the opening is quite underwhelming because it feels more like a rote history lesson than an actual story and is far more generic than the movements it precedes (thankfully it isn't too long before the flick finds its feet); sometimes, the actual mechanics of what's going on get lost in the background and, as such, the Manhattan Project almost feels ancillary to the narrative's exploration of the politics surrounding the protagonist's vague association with the communist party; the picture doesn't delve into Oppenheimer's psyche as much as it should considering that the sequences in which it does are easily the most successful in the entire affair; and the female representation is noticeably really weak across the board, with Florence Pugh's well-performed but perfunctory character - as crude as it sounds - only really existing to show her breasts and give the male hero something to feel guilty about.Having said that, there are plenty of things to like here (as my first paragraph ought to suggest). Nolan's never been an especially formalistic filmmaker when it comes to specific scenes and the way in which they're crafted, as his formalistic achievements are usually reserved for the ways in which he structures his films (i.e. How he plays around with chronology to, for instance, create a sense of escalating tension or put you in the headspace of the protagonist). That's true of this picture, too, but here he also tries his hand at some notably fanciful sequences that utilise surrealist elements to further enhance the feeling they're intended to provoke (and, in some cases, represent). One of these scenes, in particular, even outshines the inevitable trinity test, which is itself a masterclass in ratcheting tension and explosive payoffs (pun intended). That this artistic moment prevents the movie's most obvious attraction - the impact of which can be measured not in kilotons, but in megatons - from being the actual highlight of the overall affair is a testament to the sheer success of Nolan's directorial decisions. That's not to downplay the tangible awe inspired by the dropping of the bomb in New Mexico, which truly is a sight (and sound) to behold. It's incredibly impressive that the effects were mainly captured in camera, using a variety of techniques such as miniature photography and full scale pyrotechnics. The sound (or, at least, some of it) was also apparently not recreated in a studio but recorded on set. For how almost nonchalantly these visceral elements are presented, appearing as just another part of the world crafted for the overall immersive experience, they're undoubtedly and almost unimaginably astounding.The film is a veritable who's who of Hollywood: almost every character who pops up, no matter how small their role in the overall story, is portrayed by someone recognisable. There are more stars in this thing than in the night sky and the acting is absolutely brilliant across the board. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Benny Safdie, Tom Conti, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke and David Krumholtz are highlights, but Robert Downey Jr. Is an awards-worthy standout who comes second only to the picture's phenomenal leading man. Cillian Murphy commands the screen with his understated yet powerhouse performance, carrying the weight of the atomic-sized affair with ease. If he doesn't win the Best Leading Actor Oscar, there's something seriously wrong.Even at three hours in length, there really isn't all that much filler. Perhaps it's because of the way it's edited, but it feels as though the events it depicts have actually been somewhat truncated to fit the runtime. Sometimes, it feels as though it's been on for longer than it actually has simply because it crams so much into its duration. On the flip side, huge chunks of it also occasionally zip by in what seems to be an instant. The pacing doesn't leave much breathing room, which ensures there's never a dull moment - at the cost of there never really being time to fully digest what's happening in any given scene (it actually doesn't even feel as though there are individual scenes, per se). Even though it is arguably a bit too long, it's also hard to pinpoint exactly what ought to have been removed to reduce its length. It tells its story in a fairly efficient way and features a number of key turning points that prevent it from ever feeling stale. It's often really compelling and, although it obviously has segments that are far more successful than others, it's generally engaging even during its driest moments. It helps that it's a fairly nuanced exploration of its heavy topic, dancing through the moral minefield of its subject matter without ever pushing its own opinion on its audience. It knows there are no easy answers and, by pushing you to confront your own feelings on the issue and perhaps even attempt to decipher what you'd do in the same situation, it manages to convey somewhat of an understanding of the absolute impossibility of the situation it depicts. It creates a great deal of empathy for its protagonist, someone who is easy to blame for the atrocities committed with the weapon he is credited as being the father of, without attempting to absolve him. It might make you reconsider your opinion of him, but it definitely doesn't force you to.In the end, though, this does lack that hard-to-identify element that would make it really resonate with me. I can't quite say what it is, but something stops it from truly hitting me in my core. It isn't all that emotionally affecting and sometimes it isn't wholly gripping. It's often thrilling, but it doesn't quite sink its hooks into you enough to stay with you for long after it's over. I'm not pining to watch it again and I don't think it will remain seared in my brain for too long. It's great, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't quite rise to the standard of Nolan's best work, even if there's an argument to be made that it's his most accomplished.*I definitely won't be eating my shoe, no matter what happens at the Oscars. Who do you think I am? Werner Herzog?"
"Review of Oppenheimer : I think people are not brushing up on history if they think this film is boring. You must pay attention, and must have some knowledge of this actual story or WW2 in general. I admit, the scene switching was confusing at first but definitely a unique perspective. WW2 was a very confusing and scary time for people, and security was key. That's the point. At this time, no one trusted ANYONE. Matt Damon is outstanding, as well as Murphy. Actually, even the smaller parts were amazing...if you don't like science, history, or military films than don't bother. Nolans intense scenes and music fit the film. People have to understand the capacity of this before watching it, that's why it's so loud and lengthy. When a subject is interesting to someone, it's not hard to sit through such a long film. It deserved the recognition. Lol but side note....hilarious that Sean Avery makes an appearance in this."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer has always been regarded by History as an interesting figure for the advancement of scientific discovery. While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames. Primary because of the great reforming given by like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey who gives probably the second-best performance in this ensemble cast. With most of his films, the cinematography is done amazingly as well as the visuals that emphasize of fission and chain reactions of the panning landshot the use of and the lack of color, and of course the big payoff of the bomb and the impact of all, and the Explosions Performances that on the big screen can't be compared to watching it at home."
"Review of Oppenheimer : When I was at school in Scotland in the 1970s there was a textbook called physics is fun,I never agreed with this book.Nolan is not the first person to tackle this story,the BBC did a 6 part series in 1980 called Oppenheimer,in 1989 Paul Newman made a film called fat man and little boy.These productions are obscure and I don't mind Nolan covering the story.This is a great film but it lacks pace and drama.It is a 3 hour film divided between 1 part Oppeheimer's life before the Manhattan project,1 part about the Manhattan project and the final part Oppenheimer's fall from grace.This is a complex and detailed story but I can't say Nolan handles it well.I have see the previous versions of this story and wrote an essay about the decision to bomb Hiroshima when studying history at university.I also have a good grasp of the events of WW2 and the Cold War.So the issues covered in this film are not new to me but the level of detail is sometimes numbing.The final third of the film covers Oppenheimer's post war problems and this section drags.The film is very well made but it lacks enough memorable scenes.The sound and music are exceptional.This is a biopic and what are we to make of the character of Oppenheimer?He seems to have been an arrogant genius who was a womaniser who had several public faces displayed at different times.The film has a large cast and it is hard to work out who is who at times.But all in all I say is that this is a great film despite it's flaws."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Solid acting performances by Cillian Murphy and RDJ. Technical aspects like the cinematography, sound, editing, etc were all pretty flawless. All in all, a great biopic on Oppenheimer.But I don't get the hype around the movie. It was good, but not even Nolan's best. I found The Prestige, Inception and Interstellar his far better works.90% movie is dialogue from different time periods, with a lot of jargon being thrown around, in rooms or open fields. There's barely any special effects or CGI. So I don't get the hype of watching it on IMAX, that didn't enhance the overall viewing experience.A solid 8 rating, but I don't think it's another Nolan masterpiece. Definitely a good movie, but it's not something you have to see it now in theatres. You won't miss out on a lot of you wait for it to drop on Netflix or Prime Video in a few months."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Nolan delivers on every aspect of this movie. From a technical standpoint to the set pieces and costume designs, everything is nothing less than spectacular.With that being said I couldn't say enough for the story since if you aren't paying your full atention you can get lost and it will seem very boring. This is by no means calling the story bad, but it doesn't quite resolve some issues like what ever happened with his brother. Another minor thing but the score sometimes fw the voices of the characters and sometimes you cant really hear. Unfortunately, you do feel the 3 hour run time for about 2/3 of the entire movie.Now for the obvious stuff... the cast was all frikin amazing. Everyone says Robert D Jr was the best performance in this movie but I would argue that Emily Blunts performance during that court shocked me and my entire theater. Cillian Murphy was literally born to play this role. Frikin phenomenal. AND THE BOMB SCENE. Dont even get me started. Overall pretty good movie first watch but I can see this not being for everyone.As regards to Nolan, I have yet to see many if his movies but from what i have seen, its not even top 3 maybe 4."
"Review of Oppenheimer : People don't usually sit through the credits here. The entire IMAX movie theater sat quietly after this one.The movie follows many interwoven timelines, introduces a lot of personalities, many of whom are not terribly clear, which is OK, it is about Oppenheimer and seen from his angle.For me as a trained physicist and a history buff, it was a great experience. However, it is clearly assumed that people know the history already, it is not a history film, it is about a person. I would therefore recommend to read up on history before watching the movie.I think the most interesting part of the storyline is to show how no single group of people, and certainly not a single person, are equipped to make decisions of such importance.We must work to make sure that we never end up in such tragic circumstances again."
"Review of Oppenheimer : In a world that's problematic you're perplexing, spending your time with particles, that are complexing, pushing boundaries to their limits, the fission/fusion of new physics, with the clashes, conflicts, contests you elicit. As a consequence you setup two big bangs, when you execute through governmental plans, although this story does not dwell, on the hell that you propel, to the people who are wiped out in Japan. In the end we're left to ponder motivations, of those who seek to play, with torments and damnations, of those who hide inside the shadows, pulling strings in Emperor's clothes, as they plot to raze the cornerstone foundations."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Perhaps ""Oppenheimer"" really became the main film of 2023. Several factors came together, among which the undoubtedly interesting personality of the father of the nuclear bomb, the Manhattan project, a scattering of famous actors both in the main roles and in the roles of the second and sometimes even the third plan. And of course, the big name of the director of the picture. Christopher Nolan has won the hearts of many viewers and film fans over his more than thirty-year career as a director. His track record includes gorgeous and controversial tapes. But one thing cannot be taken away: the biopic about Robert Oppenheimer is a clear challenge to himself.Nolan's project aroused interest only when it was announced that the next work would be a painting about the biography of one of the most famous people of the 20th century. I remember thinking at the time that somehow this project did not fit in with the work of Nolan, a wonderful visionary, blockbuster strategist. Now that Oppenheimer has been viewed, I understand that the director has decided to take a new step in his career. Chris decided to try himself in a different genre. And, in my opinion, he did it well.The picture covers several decades of the scientist's life, shows the busy life of a man, his relationship with his wife, mistress, and many other people, among whom the line of interaction with the head of the US Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss, is especially important.The picture differs sharply from the usual Nolan narrative. There is no need to wait for the huge scale and splendor of Aimax filming, which the author loves so much. The film excites in a completely different way. There are a lot of characters, a non-linear narrative and two story arcs, which, as I see it, are specially created in color and in a black-and-white picture. One of them, in color, shows the subjective point of view of the main character, Robert Oppenheimer. This arch allows you to trace the story of Robert's life as the father of the atomic bomb sees it. The second one is made in black and white (or rather the absence of such) and is designed to show an objective picture and at the same time focuses on the story of Lewis Strauss. Nolan adds a bright tempo, a very large number of dialogues, fast editing and excellent music by Ludwig Goransson.Nolan's characters are lively and multifaceted. You will not be able to see outright villains and enemies here. There are just people here who have become part of history. They accomplish it by changing the fate of mankind once and for all, creating the Sword of Damocles, which to this day hangs over the whole world with an invisible tip. What was created many decades ago, that terrible weapon that is now taken for granted, may well have been created as a deterrent. But it may just as well be fatal, once it hits entire nations.All these problems run like a red thread through the narrative of the picture. Nolan shows his Oppenheimer as a man who sees in nightmares what he himself created. And the main merit of the script, the direction and, of course, the actor Cillian Murphy, who plays Robert, is that nerve, that taut string that Oppenheimer has turned into over the years. The film shows how this man suffers from what he has given to people. And if from episode to episode we see that he reacts vaguely to his offspring, which will bring death, then closer to the finale the protagonist changes, as if not giving a sign to others, but having wild pain and nightmares inside himself, imagining how he became the destroyer of worlds.The cast is great. There are a lot of famous names in diverse roles. Robert Downey Jr. Stands apart from Murphy, of course. The script disposes in such a way that the latter acts as a kind of antagonist, a person, which is very important for this story. Maybe so. I didn't see any amazing performance by Downey Jr., he might be even better, but the actor coped with this role perfectly.The painting is undoubtedly an important milestone in the career of Killian Murphy. He starred with Christopher many times, but he took the main role for the first time and, in my opinion, coped with it just great.""Oppenheimer"" can hardly be written into the best works of Christopher Nolan. The author has much stronger films, among which there is no doubt ""Interstellar"", ""Inception"", the trilogy about the Dark Knight, ""The Prestige"" and others. But this film is a message to the world that we all live in a dangerous time when it is worth rethinking the world order, where there are global challenges. The film is ready to give a strong slap in the face so that people wake up and think where they are taking us, what we will come to in the end. In addition, the picture shows how the author's name can work for him. And Nolan's original movie turned out to be so interesting that it attracted a mass consumer. The film will not give ratings to everything that was shown. This is a great move by Nolan. The viewer himself must speculate after the credits, who is who in this story, and, most importantly, what those events led us to.The painting demonstrates and declares that the creation of atomic weapons was conceived as something that would put an end to wars once and for all. Maybe so, maybe not. We will never know the true motives of the people who turned atomic energy into a dangerous weapon. However, even if we assume that this was the case, our modernity clearly shows that achieving world peace does not work. And it may never work.8 out of 10."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The story is about J. Robert Oppenheimer, lovingly called Oppie, who is (maybe) wrongfully suspected of being a security risk, a suspicion cunningly used by another man who doesn't like Oppie, and therefore Oppie loses his security clearance, but later the second man experiences consequences of his unjust behaviour. Oppie doesn't regain his security clearance but gets decorated, which makes his wife happy. In a sideline to the story several hundreds of thousands of civilians get killed by the bomb Oppie developed, which costs him (Oppie) at least a few nights of good sleep, earning him the title of crybaby by Harry S. Truman."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer was just okay-good. It felt much too rushed at times, much too slow at others, but always forced.Though the acting was stellar, the movie itself was a long, jerky, scattered bio-pic that tried to do a little too much at the expense of being a great.I left feeling too many important themes were just glossed and insufficiently explored for a movie of this magnitude.Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.But it's always cool to see physicists, scientists, and math legends (and their famous egos) get screen time. The star studded cast and their incredible performances was the saving grace, but even they could only do so much to save the awkward pacing and complex themes left on the table, barely touched."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The story is presented really well and through the eyes of Oppenheimer. 90% of the movie feels like a flashback scene which though looks really cool, doesn't actually feel like something I would watch again. As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s. There were so many characters and sub-stories that it felt like someone compressed an entire tv series into a 3 hour long movie.Movie critics will give this a good score owing to its incredible style and presentation and most of the audience will do the same. But purely from an entertainment point of view this was 7/10."
"Review of Oppenheimer : A movie about life of Robert Oppenheimer, the focal scientist who helped bring to life the atomic bomb.This was the first movie this year to get me excited to go to back to the movies but this movie ultimately disappointed me in several ways. In the end the negatives outweighed the positives.The good:
Fantastic scoreGood acting overall, especially Cillian Murphy is great, so is Robert Downey JrExcellent cinematographyThe bad:
-Story feels disjointed, time jumps are excessive to the point that is dostracting
Movie tries to pack too much into theee hour runtime and doesn't get it's priorities right. It feels like a series of ""This happened and then that happened"" scenes and a collage of everything in his life. Several prominent characters get introduced in rapid succession and they are gone before you get to know them or to care in the slightest. On the other hand the movie dedicates too much time to things like the courtroom drama and sex scenesUnnecessary sex and nudity, with all the feminist movement these days and considering we're in 2023, we surely should not put sex acenes and nudity only for the sake of it but only if they add to the plot. Unfortunately in Openheimer's case they don't. We see absolute unnecessary sex and nudity in this film that serve no purpose.One last note, there is no reason to watch this movie in IMAX other than an underwhelming explosion scene that takes a maximum of 10 minutes.Despite being a Nolan fan, I have to give this one a 6 overall."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I have to admit: Oppenheimer didn't live up to the hype for me. This is not a bad film per se and while it depicts a frightening turning point in history, its style didn't suit me.Overall I think it's too densely packed and there isn't a payoff for the 3-hour runtime. I didn't feel emotionally connected to any of the characters because they are underdeveloped. There are different timelines, subjects and characters that get introduced and are gone before we get to known or care for them. Plus, the movie is overly dialogue-heavy and politically oriented for its own good. I enjoy engaging conversations but it's filled with technical dialogue, hearings and bureaucracy, which doesn't work for me. I might as well read a book or a Wikipedia page.I will, however, praise the acting of the entire cast and the immersive score and sound design. I wish I could say the same about the visual effects but I found what we were presented underwhelming."
Review of Oppenheimer : I'm a huge Nolan fan and went into the cinema expecting yet another 9/10 experience. I was disappointed.In my opinion the form doesn't fit the story. It's too infomation-dense to be a movie. It should've been a 5-episode mini series like Chernobyl or a semi-documentury feature on Discovery Channel. I found myself overwhelmed by all the dialogue and the constant switching between time lines.I also thought it was too pretentious. Almost every scene feels like a build up towards something important. The music is constantly rushing you like you have to prepare for something to happen. But nothing happens. Even the moment where the bomb is tested for the first time is an anti-climax.The acting is supercious and there are no oscar worthy performances. Cillian Murphy doesn't have the skills to portray a vast array of emotions. He only has two or three expressions.I give it a 7 for the production quality and the effort that has been put into it. But a 7 is too high for the experience I had.Don't go to the cinema. Wait for it to come out on a streaming service so you can pause to catch a breath and watch it like a mini-series. The form the story was supposed to have.
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer is a overall mediocre film. It depends too much on sound effects, and loud, sudden flashes as seen in the beginning, the only thing that makes the film engaging to the audience. There is a lot of unnecessary content, and is hard to understand even for Christopher Nolan standards. The fact that there isn't a lot of suspense is understandable as we all know that the Atom bombs would be dropped in the end, so suspense is attempted through chopping up the timeline and scattering it throughout the movie. It would've been better for the film if the bombs were shown dropped in the beginning and have the story told in a reversed manner."
"Review of Oppenheimer : This movie missed the opportunity to create something great. I don't understand that in a 3-hours long movie, there wasn't space left for the content of the 2 real war bombs that killed innocent people in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. 200000+Showing the evil grin on the devil's face would have been a message for audiences all over the world that would have an impact for the rest of their life. But what is the message instead: Oppenheimer wasn't responsible for that decision - he just built the bomb and afterwards he had regrets. That is what will be left in people's memories. The plot of that 3-hour movie is mostly about Lewis Strauss and the relationship between him and Oppenheimer - an ego war by Lewis Strauss.Another missed chance: The visuals of the nuclear explosion were without CGI. But think about it: filming a fire explosion in order to make it look like a nuclear explosion, is a bad idea. There is no better reason for CGI than avoiding a real nuclear bomb. So why filming a fire explosion? I don't understand it.Positive: the actors did a great job. But it is not Nolan's best movie or even THE best movie as some people predicted.That has been pure hype."
"Review of Oppenheimer : For those of you expecting massive explosions and thundering sounds of the bombs dropped on the two cities will be sorely disappointed. Overall a great movie spending great amount of time and detail exploring the psyche behind the creator of the Atomic bomb. Science nerds will catch on to same major name drops besides Einstein and be responsible to explain to the normies what ""Nuclear Fission"" means.Cillian Murphy's acting was beyond par and there is no doubt if anyone else could have replaced him on the role. The movie explores the politics in the background of the world war - both government and professional.My honest feedback for those about to watch would be to not buy into the hype of watching it in IMAX for the ""Perfect experience"" because this movie can be watched on a standard screen just as well. In fact I would say even better because a lot of the dialogue gets lost between the bass coming from the IMAX speakers."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Long story short, this could've been a way lot better if it was shorter, less complicated and with a bit less of new character introduction.I had no problem with the timeline changing but throughout the movie I thought that I am missing something, Nolan kept introducing new characters and subjects as if we are already familiar with the story, which we aren't, he should really stop making his movies more complicated, great movies can be simpler too.We should've seen the bomb explode more dramatically (he should've used CGI), seriously, I was not satisfied with the explosion, too mild for an atomic bomb, the audience deserved better.It was 3 hours long and yet I felt tired of the pacing, seemed too fast and jumpy, not enough for the audience to fully understand.The acting was amazing which is not a surprise given that the cast are all superstars, so I won't give credit for that.Overall the movie was ok, but highly overrated and not worth the hype obviously."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Good movie, glad I saw it.I did not think it was quite as great as perhaps I had expected, though. As someone who has studied some physics, I would have liked to see a lot more of it. I did like the casting of all the famous physicists whose names I know well, but that too could have been milked a little more. And there were many things at Los Alamos that would have added nice context (like the ""demon core"" and its victims. And a clearer explanation of the fact that they only tested the plutonium bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki; the Uranium bomb needed no testing; they knew it would work, and it did - on Hiroshima).And three hours is long: the story about the loss of his security clearance took, I think, much longer than would have been needed. I thought ""OK yes, he's being screwed; he'll lose the clearance"" - and then it took another hour to ever so slowly get to that point.And the constant going back and forth in time was also sometimes frustratingly confusing."
"Review of Oppenheimer : TL:DR. - Too long, kind of dull. Didn't care for any of the characters.""Oppenheimer,"" Nolan's latest, brings together a monumental cast that delivers notably strong performances, particularly from Murphy and Downey Jr. Ludwig Göransson's score is a haunting backbone to the film's technical prowess. However, the movie's pacing suffers from its nonlinear structure and a convoluted array of characters, often overshadowing its more profound moments. While technically impressive, the film may be too intricate for its own good, struggling to consistently engage its audience throughout its three-hour run. Nolan aficionados might find value, but others may find it wanting."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Acting was fabulous. Choice of film stock and the way it was filmed also. But (and this is quite a big but), a lot of the scenes were out of focus. Especially the IMAX 70mm shots. It was so distracting to a point that I went looking for focus points (oh look, the ear is in focus). I know Nolan doesn't 're-shoot' but it felt sloppy work.As a Dutch person, I also feel slightly offended that there wasn't even an attempt at Dutch. I don't know what that was, but it was certainly not Dutch. Those sloppy things annoy me when a film is so raved about.Maybe a bit too much hype around Nolan?Stunning cast and a great performance overall, but it's a long way sitting through (3hr) with a bit of a boringness to it."
"Review of Oppenheimer : This is a beautifully produced movie with brilliant performances. Murphy, Downey, Damon all excellent. The problem is that it was at least a half hour too long. You can kill a film with drag. I expected the movie to stop shortly after the atomic bomb, with the conclusion summarized in end credit texts. But it kept going on and on with the interminable committee hearing. Committees are boring-I've been on them. The director and editor needed to kill some darlings on this. Cut the fat. A bit about the later hearing, with an aside to hidden enemies, would have been fine. But this was so long and boring that it left a bad taste."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Watched it twice now. It's definitely a very very good movie technically, amazing cinematography, brilliant acting from everyoneBut at least in my opinion, the whole story is just quite meh I guess. I could summarise the story in a paragraph without missing many details.Oppenheimer was a Jewish, ""suspected communist"", who brought Quantum Physics to the USA. His left wing mindset brought him some scrutiny from government officials and the like. He visits many univieraities and top minds through Europe, after which he returns to the California. He is recruited to head a top secret Nuclear Bomb project at a Los Alamos, NM, where a town was created for the scientists. At Los Alamos, the many scientists argued with each other on various things, some threatened to leave and others did leave. Oppenheimer had some trouble with his security clearance due to his ""communist links."" Eventually they complete the bomb, test it, it works. The US then bombs Japan twice. Many people are happy about the bombing, but many, Oppenheimer included are torn. They had built a WMD that killed countless innocent civilians. Oppenheimer is then scrutinised, through the doing of Strauss about his ""communist links"" and views about the H-Bomb even while he wasn't a communist at all. Strauss is testified against for wrongly bringing the case against Oppenheimer. The movie then ends with Oppenheimer realising/considering the weight of what he has done.I feel strauss didn't really add anything at all to the movie. Completely remove him and nothing really changes.I know it's based on a historical event, but like it's so obvious what would happen, scientists build a WMD that's scrutinised because it can be used for evil. They use the bomb, they realise what they have potentially just done. And that's really it.It's pretty obvious to me that building a WMD would bring about some morale conundrums.I think It was much too long, the third act was almost entirely unnecessary."
"Review of Oppenheimer : 1- An atomic bomb test scene that a child could have directed better.2- An atomic bomb movie without actually narrating nor showing the events of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bomb drop off.3- An atomic bomb movie without showing burning bodies and fire melting people and any of the suffering of those injured.4- An atomic bomb movie totally not caring about the actual people who got hurt by the bomb (Japanese people) but rather on americans being heroes and focusing on turning the maker of the bomb a hero and him being a victim of personal grudges and communist stuff and personal enemies like we actually care about any of that.5- A 3-hour movie that could have been easily 2-hours without any damage.6- After 3 hours you still don't know if Oppenheimer had feelings of suffering or regret of he did nor any personal conflicts he was having.7- An Einstein actor who looks like a Shawarma restaurant chef with very cheesy lines to say.Well, what a disappointment from Nolan and what an over-hyped movie. If there is anything good with this movie is the incredible performance of Robert Downey Jr in addition to one or two cinematic shots where Oppenheimer face was still and his background was shaking but that's pretty much it !!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : This movie is definitely a gem and a unique film that deserves to be seen but viewers need to know what they are getting themselves into before watching it. This isn't a war movie and there's barely any elements of action, suspense, or thriller in this. This is history and autobiography from a cinematic and dramatic point of view. You go in there just to focus on the dialogue and the acting performance going on because that's what it's all about in this movie. It's basically two stories of Oppenheimer -
1) His involvement in developing the A Bomb
2) The suspicion of him being a Communist.This isn't a war movie. It's strictly about Oppenheimer and what he was and what he went through. I personally thought it was overextended and hoped to see more about the war, the actual effects of the A Bomb and its aftermath impact but that wasn't the case here.Basically, this movie is more of an autobiography with a course of history revolving around a specific character. It's worth watching but it's not something to watch again (unless you are obsessed with the actual character) and it's not cinema worthy (unless you really want to experience that 1 minute explosion scene) because it's all about dialogue and characters."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Except for some forgivable goofs, the entire story is a masterpiece. It demonstrates how a talented and complex man achieved both, great success in managing a team of brilliant physicists to perform one of the hardest tasks possible in an extremely short time and in propagating the ideas that would restrict the use of the invention he managed to bring to life.While I enjoyed the movie in general and the way the title person was presented especially, the montage was sometimes a bit chaotic, the music is a bit too loud to understand all the details of the conversations for a non-native speaker. There was also too much focus on political aspects and too little on the substance of the physical or mathematical issues. The team efforts and the way the underlying problems were resolved which were perfectly depicted in The Imitation game not to mention Chernobyl, were not well pronounced here, that's why just 7 starts. On the other hand, the first of the abovementioned movies was less accurate in presenting the title person and this one was so true to history that I could hardly find anything that would cause rejection."
"Review of Oppenheimer : This movie was hard to get through. I am glad I did not go to the theater to see it because the first hour and a half were boring. I came back into the movie with an hour and a half remaining and actually was able to watch the rest. The acting was good and I believe the best were Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt. Also, personally liked Alden Ehrenreich's character. The best part of the movie was the last 45 minutes (no spoiler) so it is my opinion only that this movie could have been shorter so it moved a bit faster. Not sure I would vote for an Academy for the picture but some for the acting. Again, seriously glad I did not go to the theater to see this one."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer is composed of 95% dialogue, all of it well written by the way, and for 2h it becomes a little overwhelming. We get no chance to breathe and appreciate or take in what's just been said. Which is something I've felt throughout the movie, it's just more dialogue and more information fed to you one after the other.I really think they could have done it with 2h total duration and keep it more engaging. Spare some details and focus more on what's relevant. Some things don't add much to the story, so it becomes more biographical than anything else.That being said everything else is top notch, from the cinematography, the directing, the actors, the sets and set pieces.Will i watch it again? Probably not. I rewatched other Nolan's movies plenty of times, like Memento, Interstellar, The Prestige, Inception and Dunkirk. This one doesn't cut it for me, literally.Good movie, but it starts to feel Nolan has had his time."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Let's be clear about this, the film is NOT about the story of the race to build the first nuke. There is NOTHING here about the Axis effort to build the bomb. This film is just about Oppenheimer, and it's not even a biopic in the true sense, it's just the story of HIS effort to build the bomb, with the assistance of a group of mostly Jewish scientists. Murphy is completely superb in the role, he IS Oppenheimer! This is one of the best acting performances I've ever seen and if Murphy doesn't pick up an Oscar then this world is mad. The storyline itself gets wrapped up in Oppenheimer's personal life and his later struggles to avoid being labelled as a communist and a security risk. There is little about Oppenheimer's early life and his family background; you are often made to feel that he was some kind of heroic figure when in truth he was a very flawed human being. There is even a scene when Oppenheimer's wife worries about him losing his job and their nice home - total BS because Oppenheimer was a rich man independently of his job. He inherited the equivalent of $4M in today's money when his father died early on in Oppenheimer's life and certainly would not have worried about losing his job. His job was a hobby, an obsessive hobby that he was brilliant at , but a hobby all the same - he did not need it to survive. The investigation story later on in the film was boring and lengthy, stretching out the film at least half an hour more than needed. It's necessary to call out Robert Downey Jr as Oppenheimer's FBI nemesis, Lewis Strauss, for a brilliant acting performance, and credit also needs to go to Benny Safdie as Edward Teller and David Krumholtz as Isidor Rabi, both of whom were excellent. The bit parts played by Branagh, Conti and Oldman were, predictably, executed superbly by these masterful actors. The female cast was a disappointment, but then they didn't have much material to get their teeth into, so hardly surprising. Overall I give this film 7 out of 10 for the great acting, but the storyline was poorly handled by Nolan, not one of my favourite directors. Lastly, the very loud sounds and music (if you call it that) during the film ruined much of the enjoyment."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Way too long. It could have lasted 1h less without a problem, cutting all the political part (remember the nice text at the end of a film that explains what happened next? Exactly what I was hoping for at a certain point). It is the first time EVER I looked at the watch continuously while at the cinema, hoping for an end. The acting was great but I did not like the plot AT ALL. I hated the imaginery ""Beautiful Mind"" and ""The Queen's Gambit"" scenes, I hated the flashbacks (some in B&W, while others not), I hated the fact Oppenheimer was so poorly depicted in his intimate personality and thoughts. Too much characters doing stuff alltogether, really I advise you to read a bit of history (like a who did what in real life) before watching the movie. At home, with lots of water and popcorn at your side."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss."
"Review of Oppenheimer : If this was not a Christopher Nolan movie, it would not even be noticed. It's hard to understand also why this movie would need to be seen in an IMAX theatre. It is probably mainly down to the subject matter, but I felt it was boring, predictable, and the void of any of the intricate storytelling and uniqueness that I have come to like about Nolan movies. One gets the impression that this movie is getting the attention it does because of the history of its maker, but not on the merit of its own performance. The hype is definitely over done on this one. There was some decent acting, especially from Downey Jr. And Damon."
"Review of Oppenheimer : There are a few other reviews here echoing the same sentiments. I asked the people sitting next to me what they thought and they were disappointed. I can't help feel the same. I have a strong background in nuclear physics. It was intriguing, but it was cut so jarringly that it was hard to keep up what was going on.Then finally, we have the big event that everyone was selling this movie on, and it was quite underwhelming. The characters don't do enough to catch my feelings. The only standouts for me were Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt, but RDJ's whole character arc was that he was insecure and just wanted petty revenge??The whole last hour I was checking the time hoping it would end, because I was just bored."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Maybe my expectations were off slightly. This was a character study into Oppenheimer and the tribulations of his career, and about his politics rather than truly about the science and production of the A bomb. I was hoping to see more nitty gritty into the bomb's development, and maybe some footage of its use in Japan to really reinforce the human toll and destruction of the immensely powerful weapon that they had created for the final act. Instead its just dramatic closeups of Opp's troubled face. But I feel we needed some more visuals (of war) to establish more emotion. It felt exceedingly anticlimactic.And really, 75% of this movie is a small backroom kangaroo court prosecution that is just flatly boring and soo unnecessarily long.As another reviewer said, you could just listen to the audio of this movie and it would be virtually the same experience. There is nothing visually interesting or exciting."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I went with my adult kids and we all had the same reaction. The movie was not what we were expecting. The morning of the viewing i was watching the news and they were saying ""the best movie of the year"" and a ""perfect movie"" and ""you must see it in IMAX"".. None of that was close to being true. While an informative movie on Oppenheimer's personal life , not a lot on the inside story of the making of the bomb or the science behind it . Mostly drama about whether or not he had communist affiliations. IMAX was completely useless, there was no great action scenes or great sounds or music. I""m sorry but i don't understand all the 10's, whatever happened to a 10 meaning perfection."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I feel a bit disappointed with this movie. It was underwhelming for me. I know it's a biopic, but when the maker says you should watch it on a big screen, I expect it to contain a bit more science, something worthy of a big screen. But what we get is a biopic with a lot of politics and courtroom drama. I guess walking into a Nolan movie always expecting a spectacle like Inception or Interstellar can be disappointing.The performances from the stellar cast are as expected phenomenal. The movie is good, well made but it does get boring at times. I expected more from the biopic of the father of the atom bomb."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The film failed to deliver on the hype. It is certainly Oscar-material, well produced and with great actors, but that doesn' t mean it was entertaining. The three hours were a bit too long, and, by the way,, what's so wrong with the traditional 2h-format, not many films deserve longer than that, and Oppenheimer is not one of them.. In my opinion too much footage was wasted on the congressional hearing and on the 'trial', which may be intresting for an American audience, but not so much for international viewers. The ethical dilemnas on building the bomb were justed hinted at, and that would have a more universal appeal."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Too many characters, facts and layers of stories that you develop anxieties watching as to be hopeful not to missed any details so that might make the whole movie incomprehensible. Great cast, not so interesting cinematic experience totally not worth IMAX tickets.I think Nolan should focus on sci fi movies and things that he can do as he pleased and not bounded by facts. Its a real pleasure to watch interstellar and inceptions that I have certain expectations on his movies but Oppenheimer and Dunkirk proved that he might not be up to a legendary director level for biographical movies and fact / history."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The Christopher Nolan obsession with time jumping hits maximum overdrive in Oppenheimer. It's a blizzard of back and forth, color to black and white (even though black and white is in the future from color which adds even more confusion), with only the added gray of a person's hair to give us any indication of when we are at, and no years ever given for reference at any point in the movie.This could have been an intriguing story of Oppenheimer and how factors of his youth influenced his thinking and led him to the success he had in leading the development of the atomic bomb and how that ended the war against Japan. Instead there is little backdrop or insight into what was driving him, short shrift on the development and war, and the focus is mainly on the painful McCarthyism investigation and the petty double dealings of this movie's primary antagonist, Strauss.I watched this movie at home and it took me several days to get through it because of how painfully pedantic it was. The dialogue drones on and on trying to make something dramatic out of a security clearance hearing. I just couldn't get into it. I still gave it a 6 because there are some magnificent acting performances by Murphy, Downey and Blunt but they're the only thing holding this mess together."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The movie is great, the scenes are beautiful. But the screenplay is a really slow burn & often times it falls a bit flat. I guess Nolan went for the character exploration at an emotional level. It sometimes hits, but in the end it falls sort of flat.Its a lot to take in so I think it should have been split into two instead of going for such a long drag. The ending is also not very rewarding for the viewers unlike his other previous ones like the Batman trilogy or Interstellar or even inception.I think its over-hyped. The acting is top notch no doubt about it but the screenplay & pacing is really tedious & jumpy."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I was excited to see this film, but ended up feeling really disappointed. The overall structure is a convoluted mess. Nolan jumps around in the timeline with his narrative style, which was suited for Interstellar or Inception, but just makes a mess of story in a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb.Firstly, Is it worth seeing? Yes, but there's no reason to rush to the theater and watch in on the big screen. It's mostly a dialogue-driven film, and the big ""boom"" scene isn't impressive. It looks like they just blew up a big stack of dynamite and filmed it. Obviously they couldn't blow up a real nuke just to make a movie, and maybe CGI didn't look good. Either way, the bomb test scene, when it finally gets there, despite seeing it in IMAX, with booming speakers, was underwhelming.Much of the film focuses on the personality of J. Robert Oppenheimer as a flawed person, neither martyr nor warmonger. Cillian Murphy's portrayal is fantastic. However, the plot focuses heavily on the McCarthy-era interrogation he faced where he lost his security clearance, and was subsequently removed from the Atomic Energy Commission. Of course we also see the development of the atomic bomb, and various snippets of Oppenheimer the ""fellow traveler"" (those who were sympathetic to communist and left wing causes but never joined the party), Oppenheimer the womanizer who cheats on his wife, Oppenheimer the clumsy student who isn't as smart as his peers, and finally Oppenheimer the charismatic leader and of some of the most brilliant minds in the world working on the atomic bomb.The follow up to this is all having to do with a more obscure figure in history, named Lewis Strauss, potrayed by Robert Downey, jr. This is where the plot gets lost. Without knowing all the details of Strauss's involvement ahead of time, the whole witch-hunt trial was confusing and convoluted. This part of the story dragged on forever.Now, regarding the historical accuracy, there are lot of famous figures represented in this movie. It's true that Oppenheimer knew all these people, and all these world-famous physicists who, during this strange time in history, were as world reknown as rock stars and entrepreneurs are today. However, they barely say much, they just appear to have a few words while they point Oppenheimer to different people.I also found it odd that Nolan decided to include Einstein, but no mention of how he too was considered a fellow traveler and had more communist affiliations than Oppenheimer, and was briefly subject to some red scare vitriol.I also really questioned the historical accuracy of the whole thing in a particular scene where Oppenheimer is having a tryst with a communist portrayed by Florence Pugh. They start talking about Marx's Capital, how she's read all three volumes. He says ""possession is theft"" and she corrects him ""property is theft"" as supposedly a famous quote from the book. MASSIVE FACEPALM moment.Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about leftist history or Marx, would know that ""Property is Theft"" is a famous slogan from Pierre Joseph-Proudhon, an anarchist who Karl Marx once was friends with, but who he heavily criticized and basically tore apart in subsequent essay. Ever since the collapse of the first international, anarchists and Marxists have not seen eye to eye. No Marxist, let alone a CPUSA member in the 1930's, would be misquoting Marx with Proudhon. This was either a glaring oversight, OR deliberate trolling on the part of Nolan. I'm not sure.Either way, it brings into question the accuracy and the underlying message of the rest of the film. Nolan has included a lot of counter-revolutionary themes in his Dark Knight trilogy, and even hinted at being a closet Tory, so I don't trust him to portray Oppeheimer's saga accurately. I found a lot of similar issues with Aaron Sorkin's dreadful Lucille Ball biopoc. The idea of both films seems to be to ""rescue"" the legacy of these iconic figures by exorcising their communist flirtations as naïve youthful indiscretions. All the while ignoring the reasons why communism was so en vogue in the first half of the 20th century.There are a lot of other issues that I could talk about how general Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon, was made to look like a an gruff but affable ally and good friend of Oppenheimer. By some accounts, they were much more at odds with each other, and some even suspected Groves of being a fascist (people sometimes forget, with all the focus on communist witch hunts, how many fascists and Nazis were in the US at the same time, even in positions of power of prominence). Of course Groves pushed through Oppenheimers security clearance, not because he liked him, or even trusted him, but because he knew that he was their only chance of developing the a-bomb and beggars couldn't afford to play purity politics.Wait til this movie hits streaming to see it, and definitely read some books. Don't take these biopics at face value as real history."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Christopher Nolan is not a director I'm as big a fan of as other people. However, Oppenheimer is a film that I was eagerly awaiting because it is something very different from the rest of the director's filmography. Fortunately, the film is good. It is impossible to say that Oppenheimer is a poorly made product. But, it's definitely nothing more than a good movie. Technically speaking, it is very well produced. The sound work is magnificent, it manages to generate striking scenes, especially the explosion scene. Nolan managed to create a well-made biography, but it is clear the effort he makes to be an artist and in the end he fails. The third act is unbearable, it's stressful and it never seems to end. Oppenheimer's problems scream in your face that they are there, not allowing only the technical qualities to shine. Some scenes are rough precisely because of Nolan's enormous effort to be an artist and not just a good director. The film is good, nothing more than that. Certainly the most overrated film of the year and not as brilliant as many are saying."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer.The concept in really capturing the viewers, the audience, was largely undone by the constant and overwhelming sound effects throughout all of the scenes. The deafening booming bass tones hindered the concentration on the many dialogues, often hardly to distinguish.Also preventing a subtile building up towards a climax at the first atomic bomb test, which should have been the ultimate sound effect.How could the sound effect department lead by Richard King, sound designer and supervisor sound editor allow this to happen? Nor has Director Christopher Nolan taken measures to balance and integrate the sound effects in a more subtle way.Apart from this I was really impressed by the acting skills of many of the cast, naturally by the main actors Cillian Murphy, my favorite from Peaky Blinders, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt.The complexity of the script and the many dialogues made it vital to keep concentrated on the frequently alternating scenes of past and present.All over the intriguing subject of the development towards the use of the first atomic bomb, the interaction between scientists and politicians in one of the most turbulent times in human history make it a worthwhile film to go and see.Hopefully the effects of such destruction in Hiroshima and Nagasaki make present and future use of these weapons of mass destruction not a real matter choice in times of war.I am thankful I was able to visit Japan and Hiroshima in real life.This film by Christopher Nolan, the acting of a great cast and the role of Oppenheimer in history make us aware of the precious existence of Mother Earth and humanity."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), creator of the Atomic bomb and the role he played in WWII. Whilst I wasn't familiar with his backstory, I had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the fuss was about.Cast wise, it was packed! However maybe too star-studded to the point where I found myself questioning why certain big-name actors were involved in the film given how little screen time they had. Florence Pugh's character was unnecessary, and whilst she may have meant a lot to Oppenheimer, they could have just referenced her instead. Whilst I personally found Cillian Murphy to be emotionless and monotone, I'm not familiar enough with the real life Oppenheimer to know if that was accurate or not.Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Have strong performances, and Josh Hartnett deserves a special mention for not aging a day since 1998.It's a long film, and there was a lot of dialogue. During some scenes, I felt like I was in a science lecture and had to try not to doze off, and as for the timeline, it was a bit confusing with black-and-white scenes and coloured ones representing various times that didn't make sense.There's no doubting that this film is great, however I just don't think I'm the type of person who would appreciate it in its finest."
"Review of Oppenheimer : With great expectations, I went to watch this film, and returned home totally disappointed. Very much shallow plotted with so many people to remember. I don't prefer watching this at theater. Many of us intended to leave in the middle while the movie was running. To me, it is a overhyped movie. However cinematography and casting were good. I expected better from Mr. Nolan. This movie could have ended within 1 hour and 20 minutes. At this point of time, movies should have had some points which will hook the audience. But I did not find anything like that in this movie. I should have watched Barbie instead. Nevertheless, best of luck."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Nolan fails at a very basic but important technique in film. ""SHOW, don't tell"".They do a lot of talking in this film about the decisions, actions and the results of what goes on in the film - but what makes the audience relate to what's going on unless you actually show the danger and the horror? Is this film made to make you think? Then they need to deliver properly. People get a HINT of the danger of the bomb but merely do clever politics around it. I'm quite disappointed in such a slow burn of a movie. What's more interesting? SEEING the results of the characters or just hearing about them in fast cuts? You decide. I love long discussions too and mindplay.Actors are great.. Cinematography is great. Score is great and the story is fantastic. The execution is just lazy and low budget."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Nolan's movies are about science and explanations and art. This was a bad biographic movie about a controversial person.It bothered me that it tried to control your knowledge of history by not telling you anything about the McCarthy period, the reason why Nazi Germany lost the war and why America choose Japan as a target.Nolan decided to shoot a historical drama without mention any accurate historical evidence. So sad.I liked the acting skills of the whole cast and, of course, the direction.Generally, it was a nice movie, but it tried so hard to convince the audience about things that never even happened in order to prove that the Americans are always right.Nice acting, sound, cast and direction."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer (2023):I have seen every Christopher Nolan's movie - not in order but they should be seen in order. You can witness his growth as a director and the growing influence of production companies he's working for. His best movie is still Following (1998) which contained really long still shots with absolutely no soundtrack at all. Slowly, he or his bosses fell in love with Hans Zimmer and similar composers over the years - so much that there's never ever a 'quiet' scene in his movies anymore.Talking about the editing techniques, with the help of cuts, he was able to show three different timelines in Following (1998). He went a bit overboard with this style in Memento (2000) and now it's reached the stage that it literally can cause headaches.Oppenheimer (2023) was, sadly, an over-the-top blend of non-stop overly loud soundtrack and hundreds of cuts with a speculative approach towards the character and his emotions. There were so many unnecessary cuts that it felt impossible to care about any character. These ""parallel"" scenes were needed in Memento, Inception or maybe some of his other movies but why would you need to do something like this again in a biopic? Why was there a need of epic soundtrack when two characters were, for example, having a trivial conversation?A few impressive things about the movie included strong acting performances from some really big names (but I couldn't care about any character just because scenes kept cutting for no reason) and an incredibly well crafted nuclear explosion scene with delayed sound effects - this was probably the closest thing to reality.This movie could have been so much better if it weren't for the forced cheap tricks which, I'm beginning to think, he's very afraid to deviate from. No one talks about Following (1998) anymore and he probably understands that. He is stuck in his comfort zone and he won't ever get out of it. I recently found out that he's a fan of Terrence Malick which makes a lot of sense now. However, when Terrence Malick adopts this style, it works. That's the difference.I couldn't like the movie. I tried. I really tried.5.5/10."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The movie is well directed but somehow the topic seems completely irrelevant. Robert Oppenheimer no doubt did a miracle (biggest curse on mankind, actually) by inventing atomic bomb but do we really require movie on legal events unfolding after the bombing event. Don't think these legal tangles and all are so important in course of history that movie is made out of it. The movies is unnecessarily 3 hours long and sometimes it feels that there is no point in knowing so insignificant events which happened post bombing event. Rather more focus on bomb invention and events leading bomb invention would have been an interesting event.I am perplexed to see so many high reviews about the movie. But I find it pretty average and one would not miss anything in life if he or she skips this movie.What I feel Mr. Chirstopher Nolan is losing its streak actually. Nolan was one of my favourite story teller but with every passing movie I am losing interest in his movies. Batman, Inception, Interstellar were absolute marvels and all time favourites of mine. But then Dunkrik, Tenet and Oppenheimer happend and I feeling his losing his touch on path breaking genre of movies. I feel less and less inclined now a days to watch his movies precisely because of dull topics he selects for story telling. He needs to reinvent himself now and come out with something unique and interesting. He needs to set bar higher than Interstellar."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Maybe i was expecting too much but the movie did not fullfill my expectations. Unfortunately the storyline was too long. At the beginning all the scenes were too short for me and i found it difficult to follow what was going on. The scenes were like a movie teaser.(difficult for audience) the ending part-trial and the hearing part- was too long again. Very boring actually. I can only remember someone being interrogated and answering.. also, i found it really interesting that usa made from this kind of man(oppie) a so called ""hero"" and ""victim"" and made a whole movie about him. I would really like to know if the thoughts inside his head were like we saw in the movie or not. Maybe he was proud, maybe he regretted it."
"Review of Oppenheimer : This thing has been talked about for what feels like the entire last year and it was simply... okay. The acting was good and the visuals are striking at time but the plot itself was kinda boring. They spent a bunch of time litigating his security clearance and like... honestly who cares ?? Lol. I was expecting more emphasis on the bomb itself. And sure the first two hours goes into that but the last hour dragsssss. I was expecting more dissection of the psyche of the people were affected by the bombs going off. You really only see it from one point of view - Oppenheimer's. And like okay we get it, he had major regrets about being involved. But who cares? I would've loved to see more from the victims point of view or the towns and cities affected. It was only okay and honestly expected more from a brilliant film maker like Nolan. Honestly I'm sure my opinion on the film is highly affected by the CRAZY STUPID HYPE surrounding this film. Mind you, when films have a lot of hype, I tend to temper my expectations. And I did with this one too, but even still it didn't live up to what I was expecting.If you're wondering if you should see this in theaters, I say no. You'll get just as much of the experience by watching it at home. Especially since the movie is soooo dialogue heavy and the bomb scene is really short. Also, since this is a review with spoilers, it doesn't even show the actual bomb!!!! So stupid. Just the testing leading up to the bomb. I was here expecting some cataclysmic explosion and watching these towns get destroyed (in hindsight I know it's barbaric and I am not a sadist in the slightest, I don't even like true crime shows to the level most people do lol). But I just expected... more."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Like many this weekend, I spend it in a pact theatre watching one of the most hyped-up movies this summer. Unfortunately for me, not only was the theatre packed but the air-conditioning was out of order too, so it got warm and humid in there quick. If it weren't for this, I could tell whether some of the people in the audience left the movie because they weren't interested (in particular - there were a pair of girls next to me whom kept checking their phones - I counted six instances before they left around the time Jean Tatlock died. I didn't check the time so I can't tell how far into the movie that was) or due to the heat in the theater.The movie itself didn't meet up my expectations but I still managed to enjoy it. Does that mean my expectations are too high or did the movie simply not appeal to me? Well, let's try to answer that by discussing for whom this movie is - in other words, what's the prototype of the viewer this movie is build for. I think it would be best to start by quickly describing what the movie is about but here we meet our first challenge - I'm not confident enough to say that this movie is primarily about Oppenheimer and his quest to build the atomic bomb. No, this movie is more of a court drama with a backstory presented in stretched flashback and an epilogue under a veil of overwhelming drama but the movie also has nods to multiple conspiracy theories that were popular at the present time. The movie also mentions various other impactful events, like the McCartney anti-communist program that requires some context to grasp the the impact it has on Oppenheimer and the connections the links to communism (Elizabeth Cox case, for example) and I feel like context around Lewis Strauss is also important in order to decode some of the messages to fully understand the gravity of the situation. So it seems that the movie is all over the place with some links that require a specific cultural capital to connect all the dots. Having that in mind, I can only determine that this movie is build for those who have a wide understanding of the US history, especially regarding the context of the Manhattan project and the discourse that followed it.One thing that did bother me quite a lot was the portrait of a scientist and the science community that this movie attempts to push. It's in no ways a negative connotation but it isn't a honest one either as it's the most evident signifier of commercialization - to say it mildly, every one that represented science in some way was presented as a witty fellow that spends most of his time talking, discussing theoretical phenomena and coming to the conclusions on the dot. At a certain point doing the movie, there was a critical remark suggesting that Oppenheimer stopped being a physicist a while ago and he's more of a politician now. To some extent, I'd have to agree because most of the scientist were portrayed more like politicians. Apart from the basic quantum mechanics principles and paradoxes that we're mentioned early in the movie, most of the scientific discourse didn't have a clear message to connotate it's magnitude.On the flipside, I loved the idea how the creation of the atomic bomb in way did start off the chain event that will lead to the destruction of the world. The whole discourse regarding the moral and the philosophical consequences of the atomic bomb after the successful test was just magnificent and in a way that's when the real movie has started for me. The scenes with exquisite sound design and hallucination-like visuals of how the people in the room from Oppenheimer's perspective might look under the atomic blast were breathtaking. The ideas of having blood on your hand just for taking part in creating a weapon of mass-destruction are mind-boggling. And the visuals, the visuals at certain scenes do deserve all the praise. Although the story took too many ""off-road"" turns, at least in my opinion, I still want to commend the story to be rather comprehensible, even though it wasn't linear at all and had multiple jumps in time. After just one watch I can't tell whether the switch from color to black & white scenes helped to grasp the time jumps or not, perhaps it's just the room or surrounding or the context itself that helped connect the timeline in order, but the presentation in such of the story in such a way did help me to understand the story just a little bit better, leaving only the questions in context behind.Overall, I can't say this is a bad movie in any way possible but I can't say that I particularly liked it either. The hype for the movie was real - whether it was reddit post showcasing the massive film reel of this movie or early film reviewers portraying this movie as an important landmark in cinema - but I feel the hype also ruined the movie for me a bit as I definitely didn't meet the expectations it set off for me. At the end of the day, I'm just happy most movie snobs and just casual movie viewers can enjoy and appreciate this as a cinema marvel. Even though I don't fall into that category, I must admit that the general discourse surrounding this movie does make me happy and the fact that it made a lot of people look into such an influential figure in modern history is great too."
"Review of Oppenheimer : This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I work as an professional editor so from my point of view it was a terrible long movie but funny enough it still was almost too short to tell the full story.. They should and could easily have made it into a series with 5-6 episodes instead of trying to forcefully edit a crazy amount of dialogues from one scene to another - and with no breaks and pauses between the scenes for most parts. We only get the pause to digest the huge amount of fast pace-dialogues when the bomb is about to blow up.. I suspect that the movie was originally longer, and that they were ordered to trim it down to meet the cinematic requirements.. - Or maybe Nolan just lost his touch? Tenet was a complete disaster and know this? Someone working close to him needs to ""check him"" and tell him to maybe take a step backwards and keep it more simple.. More is not always better."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I registered out of disappointment after seeing this film and disbelief at so many enthusiastic reviews.It is not a terrible film, mind me, but definitely below Nolan's (inter)stellar standards.From the emphatic acting, to the bombastic soundtrack, to the (ab)use of trivial special effects: to me everything seemed over the top, blatant, exaggerated and overloaded, pretentious and decidedly lacking the finesse Nolan has accustomed us to. In that, it reminded me of Spielberg's indigestible The Fabelmans.Another huge problem is that the characters came across as stereotypical, particularly the members of the committee. The way Oppenheimer's supposed moral dilemma is portrayed is very naive, and the protagonist's facial expressions can only do so much to convey the inner struggle.Like most of Nolan's films, this one is also very long, which becomes a problem when the story development lacks the compelling inspiration of Interstellar, Inception, and especially The Dark Knight. The film drags on for 3 hours in a very predictable and boring way, so much that some viewers showed signs of relief when the film finally ended. I was among them.Overall unremarkable, if not a major disappointment."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Yeah, I got lost a few times in this movie by the continual switching time periods. And had a difficult time understanding some of the dialogue because of the loud soundtrack. I felt it was an hour too long! Excellent acting kept me interested. Robert Downy Jr. Was amazing! The sex scenes were completely unnecessary, added nothing to the story. And in those days, it wasn't graphically presented like this. I guess the writers needed to smut it up to keep up with the times! I would never watch this movie again. The movies that I go to theaters to see, I usually end up watching again and again later on. But this movie I won't do that."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Yes, the acting for the most part is excellent. However, the movie/story does a grave injustice to the portrayal of a brilliant and complex human being. It presents a poorly edited one dimensional view of his life, a disjointed story dwelling mostly on political issues and travails. There was very little portrayal of his leadership skills in assembling brilliant minds to solve extremely complex, complicated issues. Overall, a missed opportunity to present the true richness of this incredible mind to the world. The editing seemed calculated to provide some of the actors with more screen time, and an opportunity to demonstrate their acting. By the end, I found myself wondering when it would end."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I studied Quantum Physics and I knew Oppenheimer biography before watching this movie so expectations were high. Unfortunately, full 3 hours do not make this much better than trailer - I learned nothing new. Outstanding acting from Cillian Murphy and RDJ, Emily was just blunt, so was Matt Damon's performance. Soundtrack is mediocre although delayed explosion sound made few people jump from their seats. Bomb making is virtually non-existent and there is a a lot of chat in the film, typical for a documentary. If you are late 1 hour for cinema screening, you won't miss anything it is that bad. I probably will never watch this again."
"Review of Oppenheimer : An interesting man to create a movie about and Cillian Murphy did great job portraying him, but obviously the main appeal of the story is how he created the atomic bomb. Did they show what went into that project? Sure, but it wasn't the main focus. The majority of the movie was much more about Oppenheimer's personal life, including his political views and relationship issues. I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself. If it was half as long and was more about the bomb, I would have rated it much higher."
Review of Oppenheimer : I'll start off by saying it is technically a good movie. The acting is good and the storytelling is good if a bit too quickly paced. It basically starts off at full speed and doesn't slow down. There wasn't really any suspension building in any scene except the bomb test. My biggest complaint is the intense background music that never stopped for more than a minute or two and it gets old pretty quick. In fact I contemplated leaving the theater because the constant dramatic music was driving me nuts. It's incessant and takes away from the film. This movie would have been a lot better if it had 50-75% less unnecessary background music.

Lack of flashbacks: 3Honestly very disappointed. I haven't been this letdown by Nolan since Batman 3. And lo and behold this is pretty much the same movie type just historical. 3 hours long and largely cut together of small scenes that feel disjoined. Like a mini series cut into a movie. There are too few scenes to connect things together into a plot. We are here and there just jumping around in time and place. At least there is a lead character, but without a plot it's hard to really be excited about any one scene. It never feels like you are in a real place with real people.Nolan also overedits everything with music, sound, CGI, and fast intercuts making it all feel messy.The worst part by far the is the storytelling. Everything is overdramatic and feels more like a chick-flick or melodrama. Just like The Imitation Game (2014) where the scientists constantly debate how to use the weapon they created. Which is ahistorical and cringe. They didn't make any such decisions and for sure didn't spend 95% of their time worrying about politics and how the bomb is used. That's utter nonsense. And while we do have some scenes following the team creating the bomb it's largely a movie about an interrogation into Oppenheimer after the war and then his 2 main romantic relationships. So it's largely gossip focused. There are way too many scenes with people being overly loud and dramatic and storming out of the room. Which again feels ahistorical which is a shame as I have seen even old and dirt cheap mini series about such topics do it way better.About 15% of the movie is about his affairs and romantic relationships. 30% is about the investigation into Oppenheimer after the war where half the scenes are black and white and the rest are set in a small room with just loose accusations largely focusing on how most of his friends and girlfriends were communists. Which to be fair is a bit weird when we also know that he had a ton of communists working for him who leaked all atomic secrets to Stalin so that USSR could get the bomb just as fast as USA. So by showing these scenes the movie itself shows us the investigation into him is not that unfair. It's actually quite logical yet the movie makes it seem like the investigators are frantic, unfair, and evil attackers working outside the system. Again, the movie literally showed us a scene where he lied to a state agent who was responsible for shutting down leaks. You can imagine what would happen to anyone doing such a thing today. It's a guaranteed prison sentence. In dictatorial countries it would be a death sentence or at minimum life in prison. So why should I feel bad for him? He tried to protect his friend by lying to a state agent? So did Martha Stewart yet she ended up in prison.I'm not sure what message the movie tries to deliver or why? But the overediting makes it moot anyhow. Everyone is an emotional mess whining in every scene so the unfairness is hiding behind whining we can see is uncontrolled anyhow. Heck, his mistress literally admits to whining about nothing because she has mental disorders.I much rather watch a slower paced mini series that had a 20th of the budget, but will at least focus on the creation of the bomb not melodrama in a personal life of a genius. Or at least make it fun with a proactive lead not a guy stuck in some setting where things just happen to him. Honestly not good enough, but not terrible either. Fat Man and Little Boy (1989) is endlessly better."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/20/2023)"
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer's marketing campaign hammered two messages into our heads. First, that we had to watch it in the biggest screen possible. And second, that audiences had come out of test projections deeply affected or in tears. Having watched the film, I can confidently say none of those promises are true.For a Christopher Nolan film, Oppenheimer is very unspectacular, with only a handful of atomic explosion images, which -unfortunately- are not new and will not impact anyone in the audience. And it's also quite unemotional. You leave the theatre feeling like you just went through a (rather long) history lesson, but not particularly devastated. Because the film chooses -as is often the case with Nolan- a clinical approach to its subject, and the contradictions and dilemmas of Oppenheimer are observed the way one observes an insect, instead of a human character. It looks as if Nolan were trying to compete in intelligence with the scientists in his film. This is Nolan's consistent flaw. He is so insecure that he is only happy when he has proven to everyone how intelligent he is. To do this, in addition to the ice cold way in which he treats his characters, he throws into Oppenheimer his signature mixing of time periods, always afraid people will see him as mediocre if he ever just followed the chronological order of events. And in this case, he adds black and white to one of the time periods of the movie, which makes the whole thing a little cheesy.But as always too, Nolan shows control of the medium, and delivers some strong moments with virtuoso camera movements, broad shots and a great score. Most enjoyable in the film is the performance of its extraordinary cast. Every last one of them is outstanding, starting with Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer.The balance is a bit of an average film, undeniably very long and a bit boring, despite the talent of the filmmaker and the cast."
"Review of Oppenheimer : For the first 30 minutes the movie is Dr Oppenheimer being introduce to other Drs. Endlessly. From there in the film develops into the biographical tale of Oppenheimer's progress from theorist to professor to manager of one of the most life changing science projects in history. Now, Opp isn't a nice guy. He cheats on his wives, he drops his friends in with the rabid Commie hunters in the US at the time, and he doesn't appear to have any outwardly regrets at what he has helped create. Nolan has the, brilliant, Murphy, internalising his ""pain"", but it's all rather meh. There is a long drawn out trial, but not a trial, intended to discredit Oppie. And it's never clear that it actually does. Robert Downey Jr is portrayed as a snidey turncoat for apparently being belittled by Oppie. Yeah, okay. What the audience was really being built up for was the nuclear testing. The real drama. Can the Atom Boys build it in time!!! (I'm not going to spoil this bit). So we get to the testing, in full 70mm and sensurround, Dino vision and double Dolby. And... It's a bit of a let down in I'm honest. We see an explosion. In quite a bit of darkness. That's it. Now this may well reflect what happened. But this is the movies. Nolan could have used some artistic licence to enhance the viewing experience. And after that there is an inexorable meander towards the frankly bland ending. It's well made, really well acted, in particular by Murphy and RDJ, but it could have had 45 minutes of it edited down to a less bum numbing run time and there could have been a bit more sciencey bits on relation to the bomb. Would have been a much better experience as a 3 part TV mini series. Don't hate me."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Whilst this film is well made, well acted and technically impressive, it has a major problem.Although it has a running time of 3 hours, it covers events at a breakneck speed. If you come to this film with no prior knowledge of Oppenheimer and his life, you are likely to come away from it feeling you learned very little. There are many characters and it covers various time periods, it is overwhelming and exhausting to watch.This is a great example that some stories are bigger than you can cover in a single film. This really ought to have been a mini series, with a longer running time it could have delved into the people and events in a more meaningful way.Nolan seems to have tackled this at the same pace as an action movie, no time taken to properly explain events or put them into context for viewers, just one scene after another in rapid succession with short bursts of dialogue.I've really yet to see one of Nolan's films I enjoyed. I'm still waiting."
"Review of Oppenheimer : What a disappointment. I'm relieved I did not pay money to see this in a theater.PROS: A superabundance of acting.CONS: At no time was I not aware the actors were acting. There was never a moment when I was able to lose myself in the story. Oppenheimer is bloated with incomprehensible, unnecessary, and distracting images continuously cutting into and disrupting the three simultaneous story lines. Dialogue is delivered at a snail's pace. And some of the most unpleasant and grating background music I've ever had to sit through is an ongoing annoyance from beginning to end. Worse still, it's painfully obvious that those who put on this theatrical display think everything in it is clever, inspired, and impressive. Sadly, Oppenheimer is boring because of this precious self-awareness.So there it is. I'm too pedestrian to enjoy such an exalted display. Thankfully, I never have to watch it again."
Review of Oppenheimer : I expected a thriller and ended up with a drawn out boring court case unfortunately. There are elements of the film which are entertaining but the film's third act is very dull and far too long.The trailer is brilliant and gives the impression of a fast paced movie.I just found myself looking at my watch too often and feeling frustrated by the end of the movie with how long conversations were taking.The positives are that the acting is of a very high quality at times and the movie is filmed very well.I am a Nolan fan and didn't want to write this review but the movie has been far overhyped.
"Review of Oppenheimer : This movie, about one of the most significant events in the history of humanity effectively boils the entire story down to a very drawn out HR meeting to decide whether J. Robert gets his security clearance revoked or not many years after the event.Er... who cares?I understand that Nolan chose to focus on the man rather than the event, but I think this was a mistake. Three hour biopics can work (rarely), but this is no Schindler's List. It is more a kitchen sink drama where the majority of the characters are one dimensional (Downey Junior gives it his best shot though as always), and the eponymous central character is not particularly compelling. He's interesting in a clinical kind of way but emotionally engaging, no. Despite a strong performance from Murphy, I simply didn't care much about the man.As a result of this focus there is little to be seen of the immense scientific endeavour of the Manhattan Project (the biggest ever at that point in history until the Apollo Programme), and there isn't much about the physics either. There could have been some real dramatic tension over the perceived race against the Nazis to develop an atomic weapon, but this is only referred to a couple of times in throwaway lines.Matt Damon is functional, and we get to learn that Robert himself was a bit of a serial shagger (that was a surprise), but again, so what? Oh, he did shag a lady who was a member of the communist party, so he might be tarred by the same brush. Or he might not. That is not a big enough tension to sustain a three hour movie.The Trinity test is very well done. I have no quibbles about how that is realised, but again so much of the true story of how a team of four thousand scientists laboured for three years to achieve it is simply ignored.The pacing is extremely uneven. A caption announces at the beginning '1. Fission'. Aha, I thought, it is in three acts. But there was no caption for 2 or 3. Perhaps the editor just forgot to put them in. May I suggest for a director's cut that these are '2. Boom!' and '3. The HR Panel Interview Concludes'.Flabby, unfocused and really a bit dull. It could have been so much more, in so much less time."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Being a Nolan fan this was a giant disappointment. Nolan has been disappointing me with his each outlet. Dunkirk was experimental, Tenet was good in some parts. But Oppenheimer was (how do I put it mildly) a snooze fest in second half. I was checking my watch multiple times, which I thought was impassible for a Nolan film.The main bombing is not shown only the test. What the hell? They ruined the significance of Bhagavad Gita by inserting the reference in a sex scene. They tried to make the scene with Einstein as some kind of cinematic masterpiece, while in reality it's a simple dialog and a simple scene.Total let down."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The reason this movie is being hailed as a masterpiece is because 3-hour biopics are rarely successful at the box office - after years of superhero dominance, critics understandably want to promote something different.Unfortunately the film itself is disappointing. There are too many long stretches spent in committee rooms discussing things, the significance of which is never explained. It's never clear why it matters if Oppenheimer's clearance is revoked. It's never clear how the Senate denying Strauss a cabinet position makes any difference. Nolan tries to make us care with loud dramatic music, but that's no substitute for a compelling narrative.The forward story, chronicling Oppenheimer's rise from clumsy physics student to leader of the Manhattan Project and father of the atom bomb, is better. It's told as an extended movie trailer, in a series of vignettes which fits its portrayal of a brilliant polymath who thinks at the speed of light.However, even this section doesn't quite give us a good understanding of the man. He's first presented as an absent-minded professor, who relies on theory over practice. Then, when he's asked to lead the Project, he's suddenly thinking about building a city in the desert, concerned about the living quarters for the scientists' families. We don't get a definite personality, just a brief overview of his achievements and personal relationships, told out of order.It's not a bad film. It has some stunning sequences and many of the best actors working today. But compared to say Dr Strangelove, it's less effective in warning of the dangers of nuclear war. And compared to say A Beautiful Mind, it's shallower in presenting a brilliant scientist."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Technically speaking the movie is great. Special effects, the score (even though it was blaring for no good reason), acting, etc. But this film feels like it was made by AI for directors. There was zero heart involved.I want to say that Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors out there by far one of the most talented, no one can take that from him. His movies convey such emotional storytelling. However, if you're expecting this movie to be about the making and aftermath of the atomic bomb-strap in for what feels like a five hour film about trials.The most annoying thing about this film was how it was mis-marketed. The trailer had us all thinking this was going to be about the making and dropping of the bomb. Big BOOM, special effects, woo! No. What we got was three different timelines mainly focusing on various hearings and why the US should trust Oppenheimer. There was just so much information to take in and Nolan should've just made two separate films.Cillian Murphy's acting was decent but you don't get that he's truly torn up about the matter as much as he should be. RDJ just plays himself. Florence Pugh's character had no depth or development whatsoever. We're supposed to be upset when she dies and emphasize with Cillian Murphy but the movie failed to show us her importance or be emotional invested in her character. There really wasn't any remarkable scenes that stood out from anyone in the cast.This was a waste of a ticket and honestly I should've just waited to stream this and went to see Barbie again.PS-there will be discussions and you will not understand a damn thing. Those are your bathroom breaks. Your welcome."
"Review of Oppenheimer : It Just Didn't Live up to the Hype, it's Not Good Enough.Quick Sidenote 1 - Who Else Noticed Cillain Murphys' Face in the Underground Place, when he Looked at that Guy and Cillain Murphys' Cheekbones and Crazed EYES Were Disturbing as Hell? Was Cillian Murphy Really the Grim Reaper? 💀Quick Sidenote 2 - Apart from People who Love Movies Shot on Film and the ""Nolan can't do a Thing Wrong and even when he does we won't acknowledge it Crowd"". General Audiences won't Get into this Film (From my Observation of Todays IMAX Viewing), it's not that the General Audiences are Dumb (Some are though). It's Christopher Nolan and his (Lately anyway) inability to Convey the Plotline with as Least Noise (Confusion not actual Sound) as Possible.Here's how to Immensely Improve the Film -1. It's Too Long and Convoluted, Roughly Around When Matt Damon Meets Oppenheimer, That's when they should Of Started the Film, 10-15 Minutes of Backstory and then Matt Damon Meets Oppenheimer, That's the Correct Decision For the Film.2. Stop Constantly Cutting Back and Forth to Different Timelines, you can do it but not Constantly. It Breaks Immersion.3. The Sub-Plotline between Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy was Pointless (For what I would have done within the Story). Get rid of it.4. The Family Drama Between Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt was more Snore and More Bore. Get rid of it.5. The Film is Over Scored (Although the Score is Magnificent), because of this, the Score is Less and Less Effective as Time Goes on. Dial it Back on Score.6. Focus more on the Team Building the Atom Bomb, with them going back and forth with eachother, internal struggles about the project, uncertainty about the project etc.7. This Particular Film is Too Long for the Material Presented. Cut 30 to 40 Minutes out of the Film.8. The Atomic Explosion, yh not Good Enough. When a Large part of your Marketing is seeing an Atom Bomb going Off in IMAX, you better Deliver. It half Delivered. It needed that Gigantic Mushroom Cloud and an Astonishing Shot. Sigh 😔, there's no Astonishing Shot. The Sound After was Good Though.9. Instead of that Political Court Drama, The Film should of ended like this. After the Trinity Test, the Film needed to Ratchet-Up things Further by Dropping Fatman and Little Boy on Japan and to see 2 More Gigantic Mushroom Clouds in IMAX Ratio with Different Shots, Both Aerial and Ground Shots.Build Up to that, not a damn court room Drama, get that Tension going and Oppenheimer Massively unsure about what is about to happen And Finally End it with a Portrait Shot of Cillian Murphy (Whilst the Spectacular Score Booms) in Dismay about what he had Created. I don't want to hear about it on a Radio 📻😔.This Actual Film -1. The IMAX aspect Ratio Cinematography was Ok, some Beautiful Shots.2. The Performances Across the Board Were Strong.3. The Score is Spectacular but there's too much Score which Detracts from its effectiveness as time goes on.4. The Scenes between the Team of Scientists Going back and Forth with eachother over theory and Predictions were Great to See.5. The Tension and Build up Towards and During the Trinity Test were Really Strong.If I could Phrase the Oppenheimer film in one Phrase, it would be -""It did well enough here and it did well enough there but that's not Good Enough"""
"Review of Oppenheimer : I expected a thrilling story about building THE bomb. Almost NONE of that. What the what?This is firstmost a political witchhunt story, the likes of which we can see everyday now on CNN. And it honestly is incredibly boring having to watch these ENDLESS commisions and administrative interviews of people wanting to know if they are patriotic enough or not and if they have had ""contact"" with the Russians.BAD nr 1: NO REAL THRILL or DRAMA.I mean, I was really expecting some thrilling story about building and dropping this atomic bomb, but it was 90% nothing but nonstop commision TALK and political TALK and boring science TALK. NO thrill at all in that! Only a tiny bit of real drama at the very end.THE BAD nr 2: TOO LONG, WAY TOO LONG3 blipping hours long! If you would walk in 45 minutes late into the theatre, you would NOT have missed any thing. I am dead serious. Finally after 45 minutes they actually start building this bomb, the only actual excting part of this entire movie. Then they start TALKING in commisions about politics again! (Deep sigh).THE BAD nr 3: TOO MANY CHARACTERS, TOO MANY STORYLINESThere are WAY to many characters and these MANY actors dont even excell. Even Robert Downey, who does have a prominent leading role, is not impressing me. He OVERacts.Not any good? The ONE redeeming feature of this movie is the acting performance by Cillian Murphy. He is solid. Not Oscar worthy or anything, but solid. But only 1 out of SO many actors, being good, is not okay for me.My hopes were high at the start. Those high hopes were destroyed within the first 30 minutes. It never recovered..."
"Review of Oppenheimer : ""Oppenheimer"" is a movie whose ambition exceeds its grasp. An epic undertaking that fails to deliver. A cinematic journey which is meant to be profound and profoundly engaging on an intellectual and emotional level, that falters and feels flat for the duration. Which brings up the next point. The movie's length.There is no reason that this film should have clocked-in at over three hours. It definitely needed to be more streamlined and concise, something that Christopher Nolan isn't particularly good at, which means that on many ocassions he tends to meander and lose focus and direction. ""Oppenheimer"" could have easily told the story in a 2 hours 20 minutes to 2 hours 40 minutes timeframe. Movies like ""The Imitation Game"" and ""Bridge Of Spies"" did so quite successfully.While Nolan doesn't seem to be a fan of the television format, I would say, at least for me, that ""Oppenheimer"" would have worked better as a three or four part miniseries (""John Adams"" comes to mind) than a movie.I have never been a Christopher Nolan sycophant or fanboy, but I do appreciate him and his dedication to moviemaking, which for him is clearly an art form and he treats it as such. Which is admirable and praiseworthy especially since he is not wrong in doing so. His effort to always push the cinematic boundaries in clever, imaginative and intelligent ways are to be admired as is his dedication to cinema. No doubt.It's just that oftentimes he is too clever for his own good and all too often he gets lost in the weeds...where audiences can't or won't always follow, as is for me the case with ""Oppenheimer"". A movie still has to be entertaining and engaging. Therefore, sometimes ""simpler is better"" could work more efficiently and satisfactorily even for a director of Nolan's pedigree."
"Review of Oppenheimer : This film talks about very much themes, but none of them is developed enough: quantum physics, moral discussion, political intrigue, love, cold war, Marx, Freud, etc. Moreover, at the beginning of the film Oppenheimer reads the poem of T. S. Eliot, looks the painting of Pisasso, so you expect that the film has something interesting to tell about the connection between modern art and science, but is hasn't.Jill is an exciting, fascinating character, full of ambiguity - but you don't know enough about her to understand what she do and say, and first af all: why she kill herself? Robert Downey is magnific, but I was disoppointed enough when I realised Strauss characterized by him did everything against Oppenheimer only because the scientist once made him ridiculous. This is one of the main confilct of an 3 hours film?"
"Review of Oppenheimer : Ocean's Eleven, but with scientists. Perhaps Nolan even included the line 'I am assembling a team' as a very suave, subtle reference to the heist genre... my god the man is a genius.Starts out with protagonist suffering from PC screensaver visions which are discarded after the first 15 minutes of the movie. This was clearly meant to prove the supreme profundity of the main character.Entire movie is disjointed, moves far too quickly for the characters or their relationships to properly develop for the viewer. BAM! Another A-list actor! BAM! Another one. BAM! BAM!Are you impressed yet?Einstein figures as a sort of fairy god mother. Very tropey.I have the feeling that Nolan was going for some Usual Suspects vibe at the end with the twist of the character of Robert Downey Jr. Being 'ze bad man'. Sorry, but it was convoluted, overly long and emotionally unpersuasive. Bureaucratic procedures are very hard to make exciting - and I am a lawyer.However, Cillian nails Oppenheimer. One just has to watch interviews with the man. The cadence of speech, voice, posture. Well done. But: not utilized fully. All Murphy is asked to do is stare with wet eyes into the camera, in autistic reverie or horror.Seriously, in my opinion, only one single scene was captivating, which was the one where Oppenheimer was interviewed by Colonel Commiehunter. If the entire movie tried to capture the atmosphere of that single scene, we would have had a fantastic film.Ending was such an overly dramatic nothing whaffle.Worst Nolan movie i have seen - this was the first one where about halfway, I wanted it to end."
"Review of Oppenheimer : God what an absolute mess. To all the people saying ""you need to pay attention and have your brain fully switched on""... that doesn't make this ""intelligent film"". It makes it an overcomplicated nightmare. Nolan's movies have gone so far downhill since Dunkirk. The mess of 3 timelines is not needed for the entirety of every film. It works well for the majority of inception, the climax of the dark knight, parts of interstellar- but this? Not at all.Nolan desperately needs a writing partner that tells him ""NO"". This film would've been so much stronger with 40 less minutes of chatter before the bomb test, and 30 minutes less after the test. I absolutely LOVE long, ""boring"" movies. I'm a freak for Malick or Reichardt, but this? I would've left if I wasn't with friends.Nolan has a difficult time when directing anything slightly out of his comfort zone. The scene of Florence Pugh in the chair during the interview, the overdramtic yells of Emily Blunt, both had me biting my fist in cringe.No amount of quick cuts or dramatic music were able to convince me I was being entertained."
"Review of Oppenheimer : SO classic, as soon as there's a movie with a somewhat 'deeper' meaning, people would praise it beyond.measure and even talk about oscars...even though there are SO many other movies that are way..WAY better than this one. But i guess it's all about the genre that counts, not the actual movie. If it's a horror or comedy flick, it can't be good right? Well...it's not an entirely 'bad' movie but literally nothing's happening for 3 hrs straight. The whole movie is just one long dialogue...for 3 hrs.There is no action, nothing for 'the eyes'. You could easily just listen to the movie and you wouldn't miss a thing. So, if that's what you're hoping for, skip this one.Everybody is acting very well but let's not beat around the bush...it's hella boring.If this movie is going to win anything, it's just goes to show how damn shallow people are. All that matters is the idea of the subject..not the outcome."
"Review of Oppenheimer : It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles. Remember not all that shines is gold."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I know my opinion may not be liked by Nolan fans, but I feel this movie was made unnecessarily complicated not because it helps the viewer or make it more entertaining but I feel just to portray a level of pseudo intelligence.Most of the time is spent trying to figure out which time period we are in with the multiple flash backs and flash forwards and even in the main two time periods also things are not kept chronological.In addition you need to either have a background of all the characters involved or then spend a lot of focus trying to remember which name belongs to which character as names are thrown left and right.And lastly I found the movie boring which is very rare for me as the subject was very interesting."
"Review of Oppenheimer : First of all, I love Christoper Nolan's work. He's the only director whose films I always see in a cinema. But it's clear that he's is now so powerful that no one has the guts to tell him no. He's almost the Stephen King of film making these days, with the end results too often overly long and meandering. Perhaps my Nolan cinema-first policy will end after Oppenheimer.I remember how the filmmakers in the special features to The Godfather Part II (1974) discussed that it took a long time for them in editing to figure out how often they should switch between the different time periods. Clearly no one bothered to ponder this question in the editing of Oppenheimer. We jump backwards and forwards in time so frequently that no scene has time to breathe. This movie manages the almost impossible. It's simultaneously rushed and plodding.Nolan falls into his regular trap of telling instead of showing.We're told by other characters that Oppenheimer's a genius. The evidence we've been shown to support this claim is him dropping a beaker in class and not much else. Compare this to A Beautiful Mind (2001) where they try to illustrate how the mind of that main character works. In Oppenheimer that's substituted with blurry macro photography.Two hours into the movie we are also told by one character that Oppenheimer is a womanizer. At this point he has been shown to have had two women. Again, show us, don't tell us.Filming the entire movie in IMAX was truly casting pearls before swine. The huge format added nothing (except production costs I imagine). It reminded me of The Hateful Eight (2015). I was so excited that Tarantino was going to shoot a Western on 65mm, a perfect format for glorious vistas. And then they were outside for like the first five minutes of the movie and spent the rest inside a little log cabin. The same holds true for Oppenheimer, which is 95% dialogue scenes in tight quarters making the IMAX format completely and utterly useless.As for the explosion of the bomb, which occurs around the two-hour mark, I have to say that it was quite underwhelming. Mad respect for Nolan's ambition to not use CG, but perhaps sometimes it's justified. The explosion in the opening of Apocalypse Now (1979) and at the end of Blown Away (1994) looked more impressive than the one in Oppenheimer, which is covered mostly in closeups anyway.The supposed reveals in the end about Strauss' being the secret puppet master behind Oppenheimer's faux trial and the contents of the conversation between the latter and Einstein were, in the case of the former telegraphed so far in advance one can only wonder why Nolan treated it as a reveal, and as for the latter the only appropriate response in a shrugging of the shoulders. For anyone with the slightest bit of knowledge of the atomic bomb program, Einstein's views are well known, and we had already seen plenty of examples of Strauss' vanity in the preceding three hours. But no Nolan movie without an attempt at a plot twist, amirite??As for the results of the bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we are shown nothing. Some abstract numbers are discussed, and the only visual reference we get is of Oppenheimer's face watching a newsreel. For anyone interested in an account written only a year after the bombing I would recommend Hiroshima by John Hersey (available for free online in The New Yorker). Or better yet, visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum which is outstanding.Funnily enough, this movie is carefully toeing the line of decades long American propaganda where the bomb is presented as an alternative to invasion, which is claimed to have saved tens of thousands of American lives (by now the figure mentioned if often in the millions). I would urge anyone interested in this to read Hiroshima Nagasaki by Paul Ham which is an extensive study of the development of the nuclear bomb program. The bomb was never an alternative to invasion, it was a complement. And the Japanese leadership didn't even consider the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The reason they surrendered to the Americans was because the Soviet Union opened up a front against Japan which threatened not only their colonies in Manchuria and Korea, but also Hokkaido in Japan proper."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I was a huge fan of Christopher Nolan for years, but went off him following Tenet - a film that seemed like Nolan on autopilot and exposed his worst flaws. So, despite the massive critical acclaim surrounding this film, I feel my expectations were actually quite low.Yet, somehow, I was still disappointed.Nolan is a great director, but he works better when somebody else is taking the lead creatively. The script is a mess and often avoids following the most basic principles of writing, leaving nothing in their place.You might think, based on the trailer, that the film is focused on Oppenheimer developing the first atom bomb. And I wish it was. That's actually the middle third or so of them film. It's the best section of the film, but there are so many people thrown at the screen in such a short space of time that none of them are developed or especially (outside of a decent line here and there) memorable.Outside of that, we follow Oppenheimer on a breakneck tour of well-known scientists, most of whom serve no purpose. Take his meeting with Schrodinger. It's basically the two of them saying 'hi' to each other and then we never see him again.The bulk of the film (about two thirds) is devoted to people sitting around talking about Oppenheimer. It can be summed up as: 'He's brilliant, but can he be trusted?' repeated for almost two hours. Robert Downey Jr is in these sequences (he has nothing to do with the middle part of the film) and I'm not knocking his acting, but for a character with so much screen time he was exceedingly uninteresting. Oppenheimer made fun of him and now he doesn't like Oppenheimer, and that's his entire motivation for being the film's antagonist.Focusing more on the atom bomb project and taking time on the other scientists would have made for a much stronger and interesting film. Oh, except then the film couldn't be cut into a random order, which is apparently clever.I've seen so much praise for Nolan's work here, but I felt like even he felt the film was lacking. For around the first half of the film, there are random shots of explosions and stars with loud noises, as though he realised people might get bored. And, as is well known by now, Nolan mistakenly thinks that too loud = intense and that intense = good. There's no purpose for them, and I guess they stopped at a certain point because Nolan figured anybody who was still watching would be staying until the end.Cillian Murphy gives a fantastic performance, but once again I felt it was let down by the writing. I never felt enveloped in the story or especially cared for his troubles.A big problem this film had to overcome is we know that Oppenheimer was successful. If Nolan had got me really involved, I still would've been enthralled, but I never felt that interested.It's got an amazing cast who incredible performances and it looks amazing, but it was boring, and that's the worst thing a film can be."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I love Christopher Nolan, but this was honestly a disappointment. Movie mostly revolved around Oppenheimer being ""trialed"" for his political involvement in communism... Hardly takes you through the scientific development of the atomic bomb and the exciting birth of quantum physics. Just mostly a movie about the politics revolving around the atomic bomb. And even that wasn't well done... The movie hardly portrayed anything about the horrific invention of the atom bomb. Just a few scenes of ""Oppie"" having a panic attack and some scientist mentioning it will kill lots of people. The movie doesn't even show the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the consequences that follow... Just a mention of how many people were killed and that the evil politicians to decide on the attack didn't care about anyone. At the end all the movie was trying to do was make you feel sorry for Oppenheimer... Not something that needed 3 hours of build up with scenes of back and forth Q/A and politics..."
"Review of Oppenheimer : In general - a film with pointlessly stretched and inexpressive dialogues. It could definitely be twice as short, and thus possibly more enjoyable. The acting is really good, but those few gems just couldn't hold the attention throughout the movie and make it enjoyable in general. Watching the movie until the end, after the culmination, was excruciating, and the denouement was too pointless and too predictable. Such a long film should basically have a more complex interpretation of the story and a multi-faceted storyline with at least some unexpected twists, because the one that was played did not evoke any emotions."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I'm a huge Nolan fan since his first film. My favorite is still Memento, which is thorough and slow and very dialogue heavy as well as philosophical. I have a friend who works in Los Alamos as a chemical engineer and have visited the area as well as heard plenty about Oppenheimer and the way he changed the world. The importance of scientists and especially theoretical physicists is not lost on me. Between all that and my love for Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, I'd been looking forward to this movie for a long time.That said, my entire group was disappointed with this movie, starting with the run time. I ask you, how is it possible that a three hour movie can feel rushed?! Somehow Nolan managed it. The first hour of the film feels so fast, disjointed and erratic that it gives you anxiety. He breezes over the most important parts of Oppenheimer's life and elaborates more on scenes that never happened (such as the ones with Einstein). The movie should be about a great man with conflicting emotions and instead we get political tripe with entirely fictional material. The real Oppenheimer had such an interesting life and personality that there was no need to embellish or insert so much random nudity, politics and Matt Damon. I'm still wondering what Nolan's point was in making this film. Why not just make a documentary if you're going to make such a boring lackluster story? There's just nothing here to pull you in and we really paid close attention. Eric Weinstein should have been consulted so we could have had a better movie discussing the plight of actual scientists in this country and how they are treated by our government. Tell the story of how secrets are kept from the scientific community to protect governments rather than citizens in order to slow progress and divert attention elsewhere. Whatever Nolan's point was, it was lost somewhere in the three hours of cameos and more anti Russian propaganda."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I don't think this movie hits my expectation. The emotional aspects and drama overshadows the intricate details of physics and chemistry that should have been more prominent and masterfully depicted. Watch this movie thoroughly and you'll notice that Mr. Oppenheimer is not contributing much to the bomb creation, not even showing much of a leadership quality during adversities. He's depicted as a creature of emotions. The fact that he's womanising is not clearly depicted. The only character that I am thoroughly impressed with and the only character that have driven this lose movie is Robert Downey Jr.'s character. He's the reason you found ""something"" within this movie. And what special effects are they talking about? There ain't one! I am getting little weary of Nolan's reputation overshadowing his recent works!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : With each hr my irritation grew. Cutting back and forth, style over substance, long unnecessary asides with characters that only tenuously have a connection to the subject, and no consideration for the viewer. Dozens of characters come and go and we know nothing about 90% of them. Why? To confuse and frustrate? Nolan is a sort of genius to make a movie like this knowing that most people will pretend it's brilliant because they're embarrassed to admit otherwise. Still, the acting was excellent, although I felt I was watching actors do their craft, without me feeling the slightest emotion for them. I probably missed a couple of good bits but I got bored and started writing this review."
"Review of Oppenheimer : All These great work by nolan in the past..The casting was great but the screen play was too dry..I literally feel asleep in the 2nd half. Never ever in my life felt asleep in theatre..It should he considered as a documentary of robert j oppenheimer..It's not an movie.The poster is too good for what i saw on screen..
There is drama but everything is just vocal..It didn't connect me as an audience .. It just keeps on going and going. The scene didn't evoke any emotional reaction.I went to see it with such high hope. It just felt like cheated to me as an nolan fan .This surely is over hyped and over rated."
"Review of Oppenheimer : A biography that could have been trimmed down by half an hour on each side. If you don't like slow biographies where half the movie is cross-examining people in a tiny room, Nolan is not going to make you like it now.The entire subplot around Strauss could have been chopped way down as I stopped caring about 30 minutes before its resolution. Seriously, the movie goes for at least 45 minutes of boring courtroom drama after the climax.Cool visual effects are few and far between, and the movie tries to present shallow and obvious ideas as deep and meaningful, such as ""the next generation of scientists will not be obsessed with your contributions and will be eager to make their own contributions"". The movie goes out of its way to show how Oppenheimer's and Einstein's work was just a small part of a larger system, and how humanity would have built the bomb one way or another, and then ends on the therefore irrelevant notion that ""Einstein and Oppenheimer started a chain reaction which will end the world"". Why should this feel shocking when the whole movie is talking about the inevitability that all of that would happen?There is a great little 1.5 hour biography to show to high school history students buried in there somewhere, but virtually everything Nolan did to try to make the movie more than that was a swing and a miss. If you swapped the name of the director and didn't use 20 A-list actors, I don't think many people would have much interest in this movie."
Review of Oppenheimer : I had high expectations as it's Christopher Nolans movie and I am a big fan and admirer of Christopher but what is this. This movie made me sleepy in Cinema and I didn't enjoy it at all. These kind of movies are for Netflix. Except one explosion scene there is nothing in this movie. Are we paying the ticket to see bunch of actors sitting in a room and questioning Dr. Oppenheimer. I don't know what people like in this movie. Actually the taste of people regarding movies has spolied. A stupid spider man movie takes 8.8 rating. Rather I will watch Memento Movie instead of Oppenheimer. Very Disappointed.
"Review of Oppenheimer : OPP is a movie about the work of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer on the atomic bomb during World War 2. This movie review will not reveal further plot details.The Bad: OPP is full of incorrect events, which makes no sense, as the truth would've made OPP so much better. Christopher Nolan seems out of place directing, and the movie never ignites any feel to it.The Good: The cast performs absolutely brilliant! The 4 out of 10 rating is due to the acting. Sceneries are also believable.Conclusion: You won't miss out on something special, not watching OPP. It's a soulless piece of film, which is a shame as the potential of a classic was present."
Review of Oppenheimer : Let's make a historical film and hire as many good actors as we can. I mean good grief every other scene I was seeing a familiar face. Good for you Nolan brother. It's interesting for a while and my low IQ kept up for awhile but the runtime on this is 3 hours. I'm probably at a mid 7 if it's 2 1/2 hours. I felt it dragged on too long. Moral of the story..the government bent over Oppenheimer in the end just like they are doing us middle class now. Emily blunt was nuts. Josh Hairnet running around with his good looks and magnificent hair couldn't save it. Cillian Murphy Was good although at times he looked like a reverse aged Vampire. I'd rather watch 3 Jackie Chan movies then have to sit through this again.
"Review of Oppenheimer : Wow, to say I did not see this coming was an understatement. With a keen interest in WWII and scientific development, I thought this would easily be a fascinating film.Some say this movie was boring but that wasn't it for me. It felt completely unnecessary. There is nothing about this movie that hasn't been covered better in several existing top-notch documentaries. It added nothing that I hadn't heard or seen before. Even the personal struggles of Oppenheimer outside of what happened in Project Manhattan were covered better elsewhere.The problem is that the story of the atomic bomb's development overshadows that of any one man. Let's face it, the only reason people care about Oppenheimer today is he led the team that developed the most horrifying thing the human race has ever produced.Anyways, this movie didn't click for me. The top-notch parts didn't add up to a top-notch whole. It happens. You can't fault the actors, the art direction or any of the other contributors to the film when the focus of it was the problem and the fact there are already some excellent documentaries that told the story in more detail and in a more entertaining way."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I was greatly anticipating Oppenheimer because I really like Cillian Murphy but was gravely disappointed. The whole thing was based on one man's jealousy of Robert Oppenheimer because of a slight from Einstein. Einstein has a right to his own opinion of any one person. Plus there was no reason to include the gratuitous sex scenes with Florence Pugh. They served no purpose at all! I've watched Cillian's sexually exploits as Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders. They didn't bother me. These in Oppenheimer were stupid. I thought we were going to see more of how the bomb came about, not this ridiculous Communist witch hunt!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : 2 hours of bloated, dull storytelling with one hour of decent story. So many celebrity cameos that it was distracting and took you out of the story every time. Everyone clearly wants the chance to cameo in a Nolan film.Nolan needs a hard edit. 3 hours of time I'll never get back. There is a trend of these self important movies thst don't know quite where to find the story.For all the men claiming that barbie wasn't kind enough to men, there's plenty here for you. A parade of white men, not a single interesting woman character. And they did Florence Pugh dirty, with unnecessary nude scenes. She deserves better."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I had a lot of expectations going in to the theater. Perhaps I would learn something about quantum physics. Or I would get to watch and understand the internal struggles of the scientist who created the first weapon of mass desctruction. I didn't get either.Instead, I got a 3 hour long and tedious spy thriller without any action whatsoever. Just a bunch of people greeting each other. There are so many characters and big name actors, they all want screen time, so they end up just proclaiming their name, history and motivations to each other, by speaking and not by acting.So you just sit there and listen going ""Okay, this is person number 34 who's appeared 3 times already"" (we're even being shown flashbacks of the times the two characters who are on screen have already met so we can keep track, adding to confusion). The female characters that appear in the movie are one dimensional. They appear as one or more of the following: drunk, horny, angry or delusional. It's just terrible writing, really. Matt Damon was wonderful as always, that's really the only good thing I have to say about this film.I can see what Nolan was trying to do but he should have done one of the following: Either give us a low-paced spy thriller like Tinker Tailor or Bridge of Spies, with mystery and suspense. Or give us a movie about a scienctist, like A beautiful mind or The Imitation Game.I think he tried to do a bit of both but for some reason, maybe because the science was considered too boring for the general public, we got neither."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Was at the IMAX Leonberg, Germany in the largest cinema in the world and watched the film there.* Absolutely confusing (especially for ""Oppenheimer-Bio"" newbies), jumps back and forth in time
* information, information, information, information and no time to digest
* arc of suspense = zero
* Trinity test in the desert of Los Alamos ... boring, except for the felt 250db sound pressure in the IMAXThe acting as a biopic is OK, but I expected (especially with these ratings) MUCH more.OT (a bit maybe): I would have liked to leave the cinema with a clear message in my brain, namely that we men have known since the dawn of mankind that we can bring so much misery and ruin into the world with our ""masculinity"" and this was obviously the case in the 20th century and, as you can see, is still the case in the 21st century and will probably remain so until mankind finally manages to eradicate itself.It breaks my heart the way Leeloo´s did in the 5th Element when she arrives at the word ""war"" while learning the words, sees what it means and bursts into tears in the process.I felt the same way watching this scene! And this one scene left sooooo much more traces in my brain than 3 hours of Oppenheimer.As we all know, the hope that the A-bomb ended all wars has not come true. I believe that humanity only faces final destruction, be it the threat of an astroid impact or when the environmental catastrophes (droughts, water shortages, fires...) become so immense that only then do we understand that fighting each other must STOP.Sorry, I just had to get that off my chest."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Servus from Austria. Watched the movie in the theater. German dubbed.Overall impression:
Okay to watch but not really a masterpiece in my view. Turned into a marathon due to its length and unspectacular peaks.Story arc: 4/10
There is just as much flesh to the plot as the story requires, but not more. It just tells enough about Oppenheimer's private life, about his political involvement, about his scientific involvement and about his program involvement but not more. It felt more like a relief rather than a fascinating eureka moment when they finally built the bomb. And those black and white flashbacks led to a side plot finale which left me wondering - so what?Entertainment: 2/10
I have honestly found the chit chat amongst the theatre audience at times more entertaining than the movie itself. There were no real emotional moments one could invest themselves in. The ethical question of building a weapon so powerful was not discussed in any notable depth. And when the bomb dropped - well there was an explosion.Characters: 5/10
That Italian science guy was a great character to watch. So was Oppenheimer, although there were no scenes that would make me think that this was extraordinary acting.Originality: 3/10
There are quite a number of beautiful mind references in the reviews and to no real surprise. The stories are similarly told.Visuals: 5/10
The abstract snapshots were easy on the eye but the rest of the visuals were unspectacular.Sound design: 5/10
With the solid visuals came a solid sound design."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Where do I even begin with the Oppenheimer movie? It's a perplexing mess of a film that fails to capture the essence of its subject matter and leaves the audience scratching their heads in confusion. With high expectations due to its talented cast and promising premise, this movie ultimately disappoints on every level.First and foremost, the pacing is an absolute nightmare. The movie meanders aimlessly, dragging out scenes that add little to the plot and leaving essential elements underdeveloped. It's almost as if the filmmakers had no idea how to structure the narrative or maintain a cohesive flow. As a result, the movie feels like a jumbled collection of disconnected events that leave viewers struggling to make sense of the story.The characters in Oppenheimer are equally underwhelming. Despite the exceptional actors involved, their performances are hampered by a lack of depth and poorly written dialogues. The titular character, J. Robert Oppenheimer, comes across as one-dimensional and devoid of real personality or emotional resonance. Supporting characters receive even less attention, leaving us indifferent to their fates and unable to invest in their arcs.The film's attempts at historical accuracy are laughable at best. While some creative liberties are expected in any biographical movie, Oppenheimer takes it to an extreme. The inaccuracies and distortions of actual events not only disrespect the legacy of those involved but also undermine the film's credibility. The filmmakers were more interested in sensationalism than telling a compelling and fact-based story.Perhaps the most egregious aspect of the Oppenheimer movie is its lack of a coherent message or thematic depth. It raises significant moral and ethical questions about the development of nuclear weapons and their consequences, but it never delves into these issues with any real substance. Instead, the movie superficially glazes over these crucial aspects, leaving viewers with a sense of emptiness and missed opportunities.The cinematography and direction do little to salvage the film's shortcomings. The visual style lacks creativity, and the director seems to rely on tired and overused cinematic clichés. The lack of a distinct visual identity only adds to the overall mediocrity of the movie.In conclusion, the Oppenheimer movie is a colossal disappointment. Its weak storytelling, poorly developed characters, historical inaccuracies, and lack of a compelling message all contribute to a film that is an absolute failure. Save your time and money and skip this cinematic disaster. There are far better biographical dramas out there that do justice to their subjects and deliver a more engaging and coherent experience."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The movie was different from what I expected. I thought there was be more focus on the Manhattan project and Oppenheimer's role and less on Oppenheimer's personal and political life. It turns out the movie is almost exclusively about Oppenheimer's personal and political life.The sound is okay but nothing special. For the most part it's just really loud.The most exciting part of the movie happens about 2 hours in and is followed by about 40 minutes of boredom. The movie comes alive in the last 20 minutes.Overall, the movie felt long and less exciting than expected. It was easy to get lost and miss things if you didn't pay attention for just a moment. This is one of the few movies where you need to read the Wikipedia article about the person before watching."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The intrigue of this film begins and ends with its director Christopher Nolan who has supervised some of the best popular films of the modern Era (Inception, Memento, Interstellar). But as finance professors will teach you, ""past performance does not guarantee future results."" Of course because crude underdeveloped American sensibilities can compute no value besides dollars, Oppenheimer, making to date approx $230 domestic box office, must of course be an explosive success!If we are honest, however, the film pales in comparison to past Nolan work which have been in decline (Dunkirk and Tenet were lackluster Nolanisms compared to the earlier pioneering films and filled with too much formula/technicality e.g., the symphonic regularity as ""building tension,"" the interweaving of time/place, the gotcha! Moments, and not enough LIFE).That is the central critique I bring to Oppenheimer which is filled with jeopardy trivia, reference to notable figures, pertinent fidelity to place, dress, and time, etc. The same critique that can be applied to Tarintino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. It has the look, the facts, the figures, but where is the substance? Its hollowness should shine in Nolan's eyes as he looks at the world of film decaying before him.What is wrong with the film? Is it the overgracious actors desperately overstretching normal dialogue with secret hopes for an academy nod? Is it the blistering cuts of the director-magician to and away from linear narrative to prove he's an Einstein in his own right and has ""still got it?"" Is it the bread and circus of nudity, lazy improvs, and JFK ""wow factor!"" lines for the occasional chuckle and salvation from being undelivered to the atomic promise land? Is it the elementary coverage of quantum ideas and the throughlines of juxtaposing promises of peace/destruction wiped out with a denouement of fear? Is it Matt Damon's mustache? Is it that the communist! Investigation was the perfect time to go to the bathroom or grab a pretzel now that the line has died down?Cillian Murphy does not blow it, and that is to be commended. But he also doesn't blow it out of the water, either. Damon surprisingly looks frightened but still with a glimmer in his eye (thank goodness for that). Downey Jr. Embraces the sinister but it feels forced and dislocated from the tenor of the rest of the film (sort of like Downey Jr's own little embedded short film). Pugh should not be cast on this level. Emily Blunt transforms nicely then bastardizes the part by adding every color under the rainbow where she can. Most other cast members blur into a mass of proto scientist-types without enough personality to be more than caricatures.We wait in the audience with as much anticipation for this film as the Los Alamos crew awaited Trinity. But the great burst of light never comes because the movie lacked what the bomb had in spades: power, energy, fire. Without the literary embellishment it was plain Niels Bohring, demanding that we appreciate stamp-collecting and treating the audience like cattle to be ""amazed"" by cinematographic gimmicks (quiet explosions, etc.) and the mere mentioning of historical names paralleled to matching faces (and cut away to...). Should Nolan of all people be reminded that the written page and reading are distinct mediums from the screen / watching.Can this be the same director cooling in the universe like a dying star or floating telescope? Losing sight of humanity, concerned with everything but what's most concerning."
"Review of Oppenheimer : And the only entertaining part is two hours in when someone ""passes gas.""But seriously, this moving is non-stop science/political jargon without ever pausing to give you a chance to process what you heard. The characters are unrelatable and undeveloped. There is no exposition, no rising action, no climax, and no resolution. It's just monotonous talk-talk *new scene* talk-talk-talk *new scene* talk-talk=talk some more.Gone is the magic of The Prestige, the depth Inception, and the wonder of Interstellar. In its place is pretentions telling, not showing.PS: Why does Florence Pugh not wear clothes at any point during this movie?"
"Review of Oppenheimer : The whole movie feels like a trailer. It's full of stitched up short hurried conversation sequences. Every single dialogue is ""important"" and ""witty"" and before you can even process it, they abruptly cut it and start the next scene. To add to the cognitive overhead, they switch back and forth between various time points. It's just very hard to keep up. It's more like a documentary than a movie and could have very well been a proper documentary, if they had thrown in some breathing space between scenes. If you go and watch it like a documentary, fully alert, prepared to take notes in your head, then this movie might be for you. But if that's what you want, why not just watch a BBC or DW documentary about the Manhattan project instead?"
"Review of Oppenheimer : For me this movie doesn't do anything. The acting is good but that is the only thing that is likeable. There is simply nothing interesting (for me that is) about this movie.There aren't any beautiful shots or suspenseful parts. If there was anything happening then the long runtime would have been fine but now it feels like a chore to sit through.You already know the outcome of making the atomic bomb and you already know America was the first to use one. The only new information about the man for me was the part about his personal life but it wasn't anything to write about apart from making the A bomb, and that is not enough to make a movie about.Once again, my opinion, maybe I am not seeing something about this that others did see. Or I simply do not get it."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Nolan is gifted at writing in such a way that characters say much yet in fact say nothing. Nolan's addicted to showing the story out of sequence, and sometimes it works, but it's just overkill now. Thank God for Mr. Nolan, because without his genius we wouldn't know the limits of our eardrums.It would have been nice if this movie actually explained how a nuclear fission bomb works. Maybe explain some of the differences in plutonium and uranium bombs. Maybe something about the Demon Core?No Japanese in sight. Not a single photograph. Where's Ken Watanabe when you need him? I though he and Nolan were homies...
I guess when you're making a film about a man who was (to a very significant extent) responsible for the death of over a hundred thousand Japanese, you want to do your best to not show a single one of them. There was a scene with slides of the wreckage of Hiroshima and Nagasaki but we didn't get to see a singe picture, not one. I guess it's too horrific. Instead we get some unnecessary tits and sex.It was also strange that the most iconic speech that Oppenheimer made is only alluded to twice.3 hours of my life I can never get back.3 stars; one for the costumers, one for the lighting and one for Cillian Murphy."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Consider yourself warned
Very boring and waaaay too long. I didn't care about any of the characters or the petty hostilities between them.No need for IMAX--or the big screen for that matter--because there were no compelling visuals.Nolan's non-linear storytelling was confusing and unnecessary.Overly dramatic, very loud score during ceaseless committees about security clearance and communism.Didn't really see the point of the out of place nudity or sex scenes.Matt Damon's character was the lone bright spot.I was totally underwhelmed and can't understand the buzz.Surprisingly BORING."
"Review of Oppenheimer : My praise and appreciation to fellow honest reviewers. I just finished watching ""Oppenheimer"" on a 4K pay-per-viewing. I knew that it was given Academy Awards and hoped to be impressed.I was not.""Oppenheimer"" is tedious and too loud. Without writing down notes and names during the early hours, the film is unduly complicated due to its long list of characters and juxtaposed scenes. Of course, this is artistic license a director enjoys. Film students might appreciate movie mosaics. I do not.Much of the early dialogue was difficult to understand, given the overbearing soundtrack. The viewer should not be challenged to understand spoken words.The photography and visual elements are dazzling. The film is pleasant to see. The actors were satisfactory and convincing, as they should be.But this is a film to be avoided. The politics and history of the atomic arms race is riveting. This three-hour Oscar winner is not."
"Review of Oppenheimer : First of all- they left out the science and the interesting problem solving when inventing the a-bomb.They focus on relationships, corrupt leaders, espionage and the communist paranoia. These subjects are covered in other movies - and seen several times before. I had hoped to watch something new.However, They partly succeeded covering Oppenheimers regrets and dilemmas creating the bomb.The epilogue- lasting about one hour - really doesn't make any sense and didn't add anything interesting to the story.The acting is however good, exception of ""Einstein"". The mix of sound, music and speech is sometimes disturbing- especially with bad sound quality at the cinema. This is the loudness war all over again.This movie is a disappointment and the available documentaries are far better."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I had really great expectations on Oppenheimer, but, man, was I frustrated?This movie is very boring, it is like a bad dream, on which you can't scream, you can't run, and never ends!I guess it is too American, I don't know. I wanted to watch a movie about physics, about science, about the atom, nuclear fission and fusion, energy, sub-particles, quantum mechanics, the atomic bomb...
Instead, what I found was a VERY boring narrative about politics.And shows a lot of men but just even tell us their names! The only ones who are properly introduced to the audience are the very two that everybody would know: Oppenheimer himself and Einstein.Even the Trinity scene is VERY frustrating.Didn't like it at all."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Half of the movie is spent as a courtroom drama and the irony is when the guy at end says to Lewis Strauss that Oppenheimer and Einstein were discussing something more important and the movie itself is focused on Strauss's revenge instead of something more important. The editing made it more difficult to understand than it actually is. Nolan expects us to understand the plot while cutting back to back people talking. Nolan didn't bother with showing the analogy between Arjuna's inaction before war with that of Oppenheimer building a nuke. Nolan completely neglected the importance of Bhagavad Gita even worse is the disrespect. One of the most famous clip of Oppenheimer is where he recites a cryptic line justifying his actions and people would expect to learn more of it but nope. He also didn't the bother with the victims of the bomb. Credit where credit's due, the technical aspects of showing the atomic level visuals is impressive. Overall I would say this movie is a wasted opportunity.""In battle, in forest, at the precipice of the mountainsOn the dark great sea, in the midst of javelins and arrows,In sleep, in confusion, in the depths of shame,The good deeds a man has done before defend him.""Another inspiring quote by Oppenheimer which was not in the movie."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The story is simply not for Nolan. He did great with Inception, Interstellar, Memento, Batman, but the A-Bomb story is not the right material for his style storytelling.Endless mix of short phrases, never getting deep enough in the essence, jumping back and forth in time, shallow characters, ...
too cheap.Everyone's applauding, but why? Because of Nolan's name? Cast? The underlying story? Or just trying to appear intellectual rather than admit that ""the king is naked"" ?There is nothing intellectual in this movie, just the beaten pass of thriller-telling, the A-Bomb story is more complex deeper and deserves better."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Given a pan of spagetti, you can cook it in different ways, boil it, BBQ it, steam it, anyway you want, but it won't turn out more. You can also cut it to make more pieces, but you still cannot make more out of it.Same for the movie. I don't know why it is rated this high.1. Funny cutting that constantly switches between timelines. And once you think it through you will find it unncessary and too showy.2. Too much conversation happening in short durations in different timelines. Confuses people and hardly get to the point.3. Too many characters popping out in short duration that you cannot even name them when the film is finally finished. Audiences are just struggling with how one character related to another.4. Nolan, starting from TENET, is heading to a strange direction that he makes film not for the audience but for gimmicks.Surely and admittedly, the casting is perfect, acting is perfect, filiming is perfect, everything is perfect except how the story is told, the core of the film, is just oridinary and intentionally scattered all over the place during the 3hrs duration of the movie.You can say that my taste of movie is not good, but I bet you most people walking out of the cinema are just as confused as me because they are already forgetting what happened in the first hour when those last few scenes are coming. Then, when they are home, when they click a youtube video explaining what on earth actually happened, they will just find out: ok, this Nolan guy is just making things complicated because he wants to make things complicated.Will people get Oscar because of this film? Yes, I think so. But, this does not make it any more better than a intentionally complicated film. I just hope more people that watched the movie can be brave enough to write down their actual feelings. I originally rated 5, but after seeing those 10/10 reviews, it is 3 now. I cannot get through why people are praising its weaknesses over and over again. It's Nolan, so what? If a film cannot get to general audience, how can it be the 'best' film?"
"Review of Oppenheimer : What are all these ratings 5+ ratings seeing that I missed?It's a 3 HOUR movie about Oppie attempting to re-instate his security clearance, and Strauss' beef with Oppie for humiliating him. The only time my boredom was overshadowed was Jason Clarke's embarrassing and cringeworthy portrayal of Roger Robb. The part where Robb was badgering Oppie towards the end in a closed door, non-trial session was embarrassing, and totally unwarranted considering that during the course of the movie Oppenheimer was being nothing but forthcoming and honest.How this movie keeps increasing it's rating is beyond me. How this can be Nolan's biggest movie is beyond me. Most of all, how this movie is deemed IMAX worthy is beyond me - ONE SCENE that was worthy of IMAX. 1 hour too many. A pretentious pontification at best."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Good performances. Good characterizations. From there, nothing else. Such a boring film nobody is going to watch twice. When entering the cinema I helped a so aged lady to find her seat. After this 6h movie I checked if she was still alive. I couldn't find her. I guess she left us at some moment during this 8h movie. Horribly boring film with no action, only people talking and talking about really uninteresting things. They tried so hard to make viewers feel something increasing the noise level at some points: free explosions or bumps for no reason, strange loud violinists, turning up the music BECAUSE YOU MUST FEEL THE EMOTION, THE SITUATION, even if nothing happens. So overrated film. Crap."
"Review of Oppenheimer : This is one of the most amazing and fascinating stories ever - the development of the atomic bomb. Unfortunately, Christopher Nolan has chosen not to tell it. Instead, he has adapted the biography 'American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer' by Kai Bird. As chris2004 comments in an Amazon review of that book, 'I was looking forward to this book thinking it might go into the detail of the Manhattan project, the science around how the bomb was made, and Oppenheimer's contribution, as ""father of the bomb"". The book though only spends a brief time reviewing his work at Los Alamos and virtually nothing of his scientific work. Most of the other 500 pages just revolve around his social activities and, later on, the actions of the American Government to determine whether he was a Communist spy. A rather tedious read in the end. I can't imagine how they managed to make this into a film.' Indeed.The start, and much of the first two hours in flashback/flashforward are spent in interminable post-Trinity hearings where Oppenheimer is being persecuted for his alleged communist sympathies and connections. We get subjected to a beyond-tedious web of politics, egos, tale-telling and allegations, much of which is concerned with the pre-emptively answered question of whether an essentially retired physicist should keep his security clearance.The cinematography and acting performances are superb. Oppenheimer's back-story, relationships and moral dilemmas are well-handled. The most gripping parts of the movie are the re-creation of 1940s America and the development of Los Alamos. Sadly, opportunities to explain how the technical challenges of developing the atomic bomb were overcome are completely lost. For example, Oppenheimer leads a meeting of developers and mentions the relative required critical masses of uranium-23? Versus plutonium in about one sentence and five seconds. In later sequences, we see two containers slowly fill up with marbles as the elements are obtained. Drawings showing how the fissile materials are compacted together are briefly shown, but never explained. The movie shows presumably accurate models of the atomic bomb components, but again, there are no discussions of the actual physics. All we get are incomprehensible flashes of abstruse equations. We don't even get told whether the first atomic bombs used uranium or plutonium. That's how much prominence the science gets.The climax, the test-firing of the first atomic bomb, Trinity, occurs after two hours. The following hour is composed entirely of black-and-white committee hearings. What a wasted opportunity!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : I was excited to watch a Christopher Nolan movie on a big screen for the first time. I'm glad, there is no IMAX near my location as it would've been a complete waste of money.This movie is an ATOMIC mess. Story is being told in a non-linear fashion which has become the norm these days but that made it more confusing. There were no subtitles and most of the times due to changing accents and speaking very slowly it became very hard to understand what they were saying at all.You don't feel ANYTHING about ANYONE. Women come and go like a flu. What was their purpose in the movie and Oppenheimer also had one of the most bizarre sex scene I've ever seen. Oppenheimer's wife's character is so badly written it's laughable. You don't understand anyone's intentions.Movies dealing with science are going to be complicated that's a given fact but they made it more complicated than it needed to be.I don't understand how are critics rating this movie so highly. This movie is not for an average audience that's what that implies."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Boring movie, which is mostly political court room scenes.They don't show the Japan bombing but probably because we were ment to see it from oppenheimer's point of view, to which I found the Trinity scene very underwhelming, looks like they just blowed up a big barrel of gasoline. Some unnecessary nude Florence Pugh scenes, which is quite unusual for Nolan.The acting was excellent. But there is too much dialogue and characters being introduced every scene.The part where he is supposed to speak Dutch in Leiden, Netherlands, is not the Dutch language at all. Sounded more like German. Overall 3/10, the movie could have been shorter."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Thought will movie will be about nuclear bomb and how it has been develop meanwhile it was just about him and his problems - to much to boring. 3/10. Almost no physics and technical information just clean biography. With character so important to the modern history- action has been flattened to his family issues and investigations against him. I'm disappointed and for sure I will not watch it again. Other than that was done ok, movie will not stay in my mind for long time. I think to learn something more about this weapon and himself better is to watch a documentary. There ware too much of drama."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I was so looking forward to seeing this movie! Sadly, it failed on so many levels. I already had a fairly good knowledge of the various characters that were involved in the Manhattan project (i.e., Groves, Fermi, Teller, Bohr, Lawrence, etc.) but I pity anyone who saw this movie without understanding who the characters were in the big picture. I think that Nolan could have put a screen note with the name of the individuals on the screen at the moment, at least, at their first appearance. I was expecting a superficial yet intelligent overview of the science that was involved but the movie did nothing of the sort. The script writer was solely interested in the backroom drama concerning Opperheimer's security clearance. The producer was proudly making it known that no CGi was used in the making of this flick. Unfortunately, this is the one movie that could have benefitted from some serious CGI. I have seen amateur YouTube movies showing amazing home-made CGI nuclear explosions and these would have been much better than the lame gasoline fuelled explosion that was central to the subject matter. The depiction of the Trinity explosion was sorely lacking in size and intensity and it was devoid of the amazing colours and size of the original mushroom cloud. They could easily have used the actual historical footing of the Trinity test overlapped the various actors who were watching it.I saw this movie on iMax and frankly, the quality of the image was far below what I had seen in previous iMax productions. I am not kidding, the image resolution would have been better if it had been shot using my iPhone! The friend told me that he read that the iMax film was digitally scanned at 2k resolution; a far cry from 4K and yet, I paid the full iMax entry fee. Moreover, I am not sure what was happening on the set, but the cinematographer obviously had difficulty keeping the characters in focus. Let me finish by talking briefly about the sound. Each and every word spoken in this movie was played over an overbearing background music which, may I add, was overly dramatic and clearly just too loud!My friend and I both came out very disapointed. This movie should have been the highlight of the summer but it fell far short of the mark."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I think people are confusing ""a good story"" with a good movie. If you want the story, go to a library and read about the real life events. No matter what moment you skip to in this movie, it's a bunch of guys in suits sitting around a table. There are a few scenes that have small exposure to something other than men in suits in an office or sitting in a meeting, but it was over hype on the actual production quality, lacking a variety in set design and story inclusion beyond repetitive generic settings. The acting is decent, it just felt like a lot was missing to capture the full spectrum of emercing the audience in the time period of the movie and other aspects that could have been filmed to create a more comprehensive image. I could have enjoyed this movie as much by simply reading the script."
"Review of Oppenheimer : This is undoubtedly the most overhyped and overrated film of the entire 2000s. This movie oozes pretentious attempts at being artsy and intellectual but comes off as unorganized and confusing for no reason.The only reason this has good reviews is because of the casting. You can't possibly put all these A list actors in a film and make it total piece of trash, but Christopher Nolan did the unthinkable and made it happen.If you put this anything above a 6/10, then you're only doing it to convince yourself that you are an intellectual when that is in fact not the case.What a terrible movie."
"Review of Oppenheimer : And lets be real...Oppenheimer, despite his personal misgivings and nature, as a result of his works...was a villain of sorts. As the old saying goes ""Some of the worst things in history were done with the best of intentions"", and indeed even if his intentions were good, he clearly knew nothing of human nature or the times he lived in, and callously lent his hand to the works that would end up creating the most destructive types of weapon ever known to mankind. There was honestly no good reason to create such a film, and it seemed to be almost forming a sympathetic portrayal of Oppenheimer, which we just dont need any more than we need similar portrayals of the other screw ups throughout history. The film was also boring too. There was little to hold my attention, and from the numerous other people saying the same thing, this movie was a travesty on multiple levels and should NEVEr have won oscars. The whole industry is in decline as are other forms of entertainment these last couple years. And like hte Oscars, it all just a joke. 3/10 film. Man it was boring ffs. *smfh."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Christopher Nolan appears to be like Marmite. You either love or loathe. Those who adore all he touches, will needless to say tell you that this is the Greatest Movie of All Time, Oscar Certainty, etc. Etc.The truth? It's not his best film. He's got to that point in movie making when he BADLY needs an independent editor. This could have been a MUCH better film if it was 2 hours long instead of 3.The problem is that it's over-blown with portentous jump-cuts and crashing intrusive music attempting to fill the void of ... well not an awful lot actually going on. I'm afraid Nolan has become lost in his own hype and no longer knows how to make a dramatic movie.It's always an interesting lesson to stitch back these multiples time zone movies into one sequence and ask whether they are actually any good without the magician's sleight of hand? Try it with Pulp Fiction or Memento. If a movie is only good because it flicks back and forth, it ain't actually very good at all.And that's Oppenheimer. A giant bloated, over-rated, over-hyped, mess of a movie.Good acting though."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Actors are doing good in this movie, however Nolan makes worse and worse movies lately. Half of the movie is COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY! What is even worse, the unnecessary part is the more interesting. Because what is the main plot? Some jealous scientists beef, what they are trying to solve with shady political backstabbing. That's it. The movie is 3 hours long, and the Manhattan-project is only a side-story, because Oppenheimer met with Strauss AFTER the war. I feel the movie wanted to grab too much: a little bit of documentary, a little bit of spy movies, and drama. But because of this, it can't achieve a good result any of these fields. And let's talk about, the movie is a 3 hours long dialogue between characters, without any pause. Camera change every 3 seconds. Maybe I'm too European, but come on, where were the long shots? Music? I know, Nolan didn't work with Hans Zimmer this time, but I cannot recall any music from the movie, everything what they played was just annoyed more me, because it was just stuffing more and more into the movie without any reason. Only good part of the movie are the actors, who did very good, but good actors can't save the sinking ship. I don't understand the hype around this movie, when its clearly has huge-huge problems."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Bottom line: Oppenheimer is a misfire and a mediocre film kept alive by strong cinematography and compelling (albeit strangely alien) performances.The entire final third of the film is an exposition-dump, some of which is comical in a mustache-twirling villain way.The Manhattan Project is an important subject for a movie, but it's emotional arc is disconnected from what the film is about (e.g., we're invited to equate Oppenheimer losing his security clearance with martyrdom-- meanwhile hundreds of thousands are killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki). It mistakes taking itself seriously with a serious character study; it blurs the line between the ego of its protagonist and the seriousness of his effect on the world that I suspect Nolan's admiration for genius may have clouded his view of the character.Oppenheimer also suffers from classic Nolan-isms:(1) Every character has something pithy to say in all circumstances (and are ready to make call-backs to conversations 20-30 mins earlier in the film's runtime but years earlier in the timeline of the story), ultimately shattering any sense of relatability;(a) Excessively stoic characters who are over-intellectualized-- capped by acting with outstanding gravitas but somehow lacking heart;(b) Botched characterizations (Oppenheimer's girlfriend, for instance); they are meant to seem important because they are inscrutable;(c) Strong performances somehow eked from a soulless script-- compelling in that alien, is-everyone-a-sociopath way.(2) Poor sound mixing that obscures important dialogue;(3) A tendency to tell rather than show.To it's credit, there is amazing cinematography and Cillian Murphy probably delivers an Oscar-worthy performance (even as his script has him quipping his way through every scene with dialogue-- it's his eyes that get the work done). Score is excellent when it isn't overpowering dialogue.There's more I'd like to say about how the movie's perception of what is important is out-of-step with the facts presented in the narrative, and why Nolan's 'subjective' shift in all color scenes isn't sincere, but w/e you get the point."
"Review of Oppenheimer : You know how excited a new film student is about making his first movie and how he has all of these grand ideas of what he could do if only he had the budget to do them. Well Nolan had the budget and the freedom to do what he wanted and he damn well did it.I give him credit for his conceptualization of making a movie as chaotic as the atomic bomb but as great as that conception is I did not enjoy watching it. If you ever experience motion sickness chances are you will experience that during this movie. It was disturbing for me to watch because scenes jumped so quickly from one decade to another, from color to black and white, good grief you really have to pay attention or you'll get lost in the hurricane. As if the fast changing visuals aren't enough there's that music. The music is also chaotic. Obviously the them of this movie is chaos.Have you seen Wednesday playing Paint it Black on her cello? That performance raised emotions in me, strong emotions. There was so much going on taking me places but in Oppenheimer that violin music which sounded as if it were being played by a new violin student was excruciating. It reminded me of 2 cats fighting in an alley. It made my heart race but not in a good way.I like Cillian Murphy but my goodness at times it looked like he was being recorded by an I phone. I don't know what kind of lens Nolan used for his close ups but it had a slight fish eye effect and to me, it was disturbing. Cillian looked menacing, delusional and at times like an animated corpse. His skin was pulled so tightly I wonder if he just had a face lift before doing this movie? His appearance was scary.Nope, I didn't like this movie. There was too much going on and frankly I freaking hate movies that flash back and forth between present and past. I've always hated that scheme. I know some directors think it's clever but it's not, it's an old, old, old cliche. It's not original it's been done to death. I get more out of movie when it's done in chronological order. This was almost like watching 2 different movies from 2 different times that were spliced together by a film student making a mash up."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!! Period!!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : I really wanted to like this movie but I struggled to stay awake through it. For me it had none of the nuanced beauty of The Imitation Game, but rather a lot of political waffle, which left me sadly caring more about when it was finally going to end, than what happened to any of the characters. I know I'm in the minority here but I also thought that whilst there were some very strong performances, I didn't feel any were really Oscar worthy. I would think that if someone was in to politics and the american post-war fear around communism, then this could be an interesting watch for them. With all the great names attached, Christopher Nolan at the helm, and a lot of media attention, I expected a lot, but was ultimately left thinking; style over substance."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I wonder if all those who are dropping a 9-10 rating after another have all watched the chaos of a movie I did, or they have financial interest on rating the movie positively.Watching a 3-hour long ""trailer"" with unnecessary amount of conversation doesn't do the book (American Promethus) justice. In a typical Nola fashion, especially since the other disastrous Tenet, the pace is unnecessarily hasty for no apparent reason. Music, while being nicely composed, is once again in a Nolan fashion, distracting. Character development is extremely lacking, plot overly complicated for the sake of looking smart. Overdramatizing Oppenheimer's private life and the ridiculous over-focus on the Robert Downey Jr. Was absolutely unnecessary. The best part of the film was obviously Trinity, after that the film went haywire in a chaotic manner, citing the goddamned Communist accusations against Oppenheimer. Yes, we got it. Wish there was as much attention to this than other amazong scientists working on the Manhattan project. I didn't even realize it was Richard Feynman in a scene or two. Barely any talk of the physics, challenges when making the bomb, displaying even remotely the Japan bombings etc.Sorry folks. This is NOT Memento (my fave movie of him), Interstellar, Dunkirk, Inception or the Dark Knight. I feel robbed. Avoid."
"Review of Oppenheimer : If this is such a great film, why is this and other websites (such as Google) filled with fake reviews, plainly written in the same adulatory and acritical style following a script either provided by some body or other, or worse still generated by AI, with the objective of adding to the hype at the time of release. My companion and I weren't alone in finding this a meandering, wearisome and self indulgent account of Robert Oppenheimer's life and time at Los Alamos, and the aftermath. There will be people who enjoyed this film but many others who didn't whose views are purposefully drowned out."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I had high hopes for this film.Starting with the cast, Matt Damon, whom I really admire, however this isn't a film for his type of acting, his trademark smirk cannot be hidden unfortunately. Robert Downey Jr is unsurprisingly amazing in this film, this actor is so flexible he can star in any film. Cillian Murphy is also a great actor and did an amazing job portraying Oppenheimer's conflict within himself.Sometimes silence is more powerful than loudness.The film is drowned by the soundtrack, at times I couldn't hear the dialogue, ok I get it that is the point in some scenes, but when this drags on for about 3 hours, it gets old and boring.The bomb explosion was weak, yes weak. Nolan's didn't want to use CGI, well sorry Chris but without CGI there is no way in hell you would be able to simulate or emulate a nuclear explosion. The sound of the explosion was not powerful due to the rest of the film being so loud, the explosion did not have a single element of surprise or awe. The screen filled with fire was OK but again, since the rest of the film was so loud, there was no awe.This film should have been a 2 hours and 15 minutes, not 3 hours of continuous political dialogues.There is a great series about Oppenheimer and the bomb on a streaming service, that is much more watchable."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I left the theater with three terms bouncing around my head: overwrought, unfocused and self-indulgent. A few good moments were not enough to redeem it from being mediocre at best, totally artless at worst. The special effects were disappointing, the runtime was bloated, and the central character conflict was sidelined by a political plot so tedious, words fail me in further elaboration.The whole thing was written in a hyper, disorienting style some have captured by describing the movie as a feature-length trailer. Really it's the result of trying to squeeze every conversation from a 700 page biography into one film, no matter how boring, redundant, or unimportant to the central story. Nolan is pleased with himself for skipping back and forth through the story's timeline as if it serves some purpose, but alas, this monkeying around only further complicates an already needlessly complicated trainwreck of a screenplay. There's zero payoff.Perhaps it's too much to call him a one-trick pony, but certainly his usual schtick fell flat on its face here.The soundtrack was nothing special - the sound engineers seemed determined to liquify moviegoers' insides via the Imax sound system (possibly out of spite, but I cannot say for sure). It's also worth mentioning that gratuitous nudity was liberally peppered throughout the movie for no discernible reason - at one bewildering moment, Einstein pops out of the bushes to dispense wisdom like some Santa Claus fortune cookie hybrid - physicists stand in front of a chalkboard giving ""explain it to me like I'm five"" lectures on black holes and quantum mumbo jumbo to Berkeley students. Naturally these are never revisited, and have nothing to do with the plot.If this is considered great cinema, it is a testament to the fact that cinema is dead. Save your $20 bucks and buy a can of paint so you can watch it dry."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I came into Oppenheimer expecting greatness. Christopher Nolan is a praised director, and while I'm not some super fan, I have liked the films of his I have seen. That and we had some amazing actors: Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Josh Peck, Jack Quaid, what could go wrong? Well...The acting was great, don't get me wrong. Robert Downey Jr. Had one of the best acting performances of the year, and honestly, he stole the show. However, we were subjected to 3 hours of a bland movie that pretends to be more than it is. It feels that the crew thought they were making something cool and different with the non-linear storytelling and format, but it really just came off as sloppy.While it definitely isn't the worst movie I have seen, it is definitely one of the most disappointing. Furthermore, 3 hours is way too much. I have nothing against long movies, but if the movie can't entertain me for an hour, I don't know how it expected to entertain me for three. What's a shame is that I feel that there could've been a good movie if it was condensed, but they really just missed the mark.Overall, I am disappointed and it is definitely one of the weaker films I have seen this year. I feel that right now, it will continue to get praise, but as the months go by and as more projects come out, it will be forgotten about and fall into the pool of mediocrity. There's no telling what will happen in the future, but I really don't see this movie receiving any love in the future. There's movies I don't like, but I can see the appeal. However, with Oppenheimer, I just can't, and I really want to see it too."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The only reason why I am giving 2 stars intead of 1 is the great acting by Murphy and the impressive cast; also the subject chosen is a beutiful and complex mix in principle: the 20th-century impressive scientific revolutions, ethics and psychology, 2nd WW history, politics during subsequent cold war and macchartism; in principle a terrific and stimulating mix. This could be the only other possible explaination for positive reviews.Despite this, I am utterly disgusted by how the director took such a beutiful and compex subject, but molded it with the same hands he used for a total fiction as Batman: first of all, a well documented historical, heavy and delicate subject is treated here with total disregard for historical accuracy, filled with selfish directing inventions, where irrelevant figures are overloaded with gravitas, while many incredible and historically-essential figures are irrespectfully given 1-min stage time or even totally forgotten.The best and most inspiring scientific minds of our times up to now, are treated in the film as a quarrying buch of childs and chickens. The essential contribution from science myths as Fermi or Von Neumann, definitely as relevant or more relevant in the Los Alamos scientific endeavour as the administrative
manager of the saloon - this is what Oppenheimer actually was -, are basically removed from the film and deprived of any role. Other awe-inspiring people as Richard Feynmann or Kurt Godel are given a ~1min stage time and often pictured as idiots.Some of the most impressive achievements of modern science as Quantum
Mechanics or Relativity are just turned into a confused salad of random words - especially at the beginning. While this wouldn't be irritating in psychology-focused and fictitious film as Will Hunting for example, it's irritating and sad to see in a supposedly historical film, where individual contributions and ethical questions where deeply intertwinned with the most impressive and community-driven scientific revolution the human kind has seen.Maybe the director, within a 100 million budget, could have found space for hiring one single decent scientific consultant and an average modern historian.Apart from the better smoothed and realistic characters of Oppenheimer or Grooves, many other characters, the interactions and dialogues are often stretched and extremized to the point of disumanization and irrealism, typical of some bad American filmography.The beutiful complex scientific-historical-political-psychological subject is shredded to pieces by the dog-butcher directing, where the psychological theme is certainly garnished by the continuous use of flashbacks and flashforwards, but the price to pay for the selfish removal of a linear timeline is the complete loss of the consecutio necessary to all the other delicate themes. The director chose a jewel subject, but destroyed the most part of it; he bought a precious truffle, but decided to only cook the dust on it, while smashing the precious thing under his boots.In conclusion, a presumptuous and selfish director spotted a terrific but delicate subject, where in the middle of WW2 and cold war history, psycology and thrilling science, the transition from a beutiful scientific revolution to the killing of half a million people is pictured. But the director turned all of this into a low-quality and ridiculosly- expansive mix between a fictitious genius-picturing film - yet very far from the accuracy of beutiful tapes as Imitation Game - and a comical American fiction like Friends, with characters turned into caricature figures and historical and scientific facts arrogantly treated as fictional material."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I've watched this film twice on Peacock. The first time I stopped watching about half-way through because it dragged so badly. I couldn't understand why it had a 3-hour running time, but I watched the entire film last night. It's hard to understand why it wasn't cut to a more concise length.It's difficult to understand some of the dialogue because of the sound mix which was my field of expertise for many years as a motion picture sound mixer, sound designer, studio engineer and live performance engineer.I don't understand why Christopher Nolan is so respected. I saw Dunkirk in the theatres when it was released but have no interest in viewing future Nolan work.It's difficult to understand why Oppenheimer has been so successful at the box office. I consider it to be one of the most highly overrated films of the past 50 years!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : Three hours of my life I wish I could get back.Feels as though they are trying to cram War and Peace into 3 hours of boringness.Too many characters for any meaningful character development. This movie tries to be a love story, a war story, a science documentary, and a biography all wrapped up in one enchilada oofa mess. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters because the only one on the screen long enough to get to know was Oppenheimer himself.The part where they detonate the bomb was interesting so be sure to tell your friends to wake you up when that part starts and then again when the lights come on."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Slow and boring! The film meanders from scene to boring scene with no apparent clear direction.So overrated it's untrue! Such missed.potential with a storyline like that.Zero connection with the characters. I was expecting so much from such a talented cast but you can't expect miracles when it's such a drag....Scene after scene of people talking and taking endless uninteresting dribble. Scene after scene of boring stuff scrawled on blackboards. And don't get me wrong, I love science, but this wasn't science it was just endless bull...Judging from the reviews you're either gonna love this or hate it. My boyfriend and I both hated it!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer was craptastic. It was a mess. 2 out of 10 stars. People who give it a 10 are sheep. Maybe they just like the visuals. Those were pretty good. But they don't save the movie.Nolan took an important subject and a great cast, and as usual he chopped the story up into a loud, disjointed, overwrought mish-mash of mush.Just tell the freaking story, Nolan.About 30% of the scenes should have been cut. About half the dialogue was unintelligible, which might actually be a good thing, because the other half was often stilted and repetitive.Also, why are there so many loud special effects while dialogue is taking place? And why all the non-chronological jumping around? It doesn't serve the story one bit. The story in its linear form is plenty. Chopping it up needlessly just makes you look pretentious."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Despite struggling with a very interesting ethical issue (scientist's responsibility for their creations), this unnecessarily long film is as simplistic and plain as any early James Bond movie or something of the kind. At certain point, the main villain even reveals his evil plan just like in a bad action film. No characters change as the story progresses, so that it becomes boring to watch them talk dry lines. The story does not have double layers, nor ambiguous interpretations: it's like a Wikipedia entry.No complexity, a straight story, and over simplified resolution - something I didn't expect from Oppenheimer but it was just that."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Overlong and very boring, I nearly fell asleep, I literally had to prod my eyes open with matchsticks, the film could have been half this duration. There's a much better film, a documentary called ""To End All War: Oppenheimer & the Atomic Bomb"" which is gripping and with real footage. What a disappointment I'd been waiting all year for this.Overlong and very boring, I nearly fell asleep, I literally had to prod my eyes open with matchsticks, the film could have been half this duration.

"Review of Oppenheimer : As a science nerd and someone who used to be obsessed with the Manhattan project, nuclear bombs etc. This really couldn't have been much worse. There were maybe 15 minutes of interesting tidbits related to themes Oppenheimer actually dealt with in his life and the rest was just garbage. It's like they tried to make it into a romcom/political film that had very little to do with the actual interesting parts of Oppenheimer's life. I won't write spoilers, but I promise you there is not much to spoil. Endless drivel, dialog that literally put me to sleep for a few minutes.If you're interested in science and tech, just skip it. If you're interested in a good drama, skip it. If you like dull trials with too many actors and are really into dudes yelling every 5 minutes about ""russia"" or ""communists"" then go for it."
"Review of Oppenheimer : It seems like this movie has taken the art of confusion to a whole new level! It's as if the characters within it are participants in a grand scavenger hunt, desperately searching for the elusive plot that seems to be playing a game of hide-and-seek. In a world where the concept of a middle, an end, or even coherent dialogue seems optional, this film boldly embraces the unknown, treating viewers to a symphony of uncertainty and a parade of slo-mo scenes that could make a snail look speedy.If, by some miraculous twist of fate, this cinematic wonder manages to snatch an Oscar, I can already envision the trophy for ""Best Mystery in Motion"" proudly displayed on its mantle. But let's not forget the silver lining in all this: congratulations are in order! Thanks to this movie, you're officially released from the shackles of regular movie nights. Your popcorn budget will remain untouched, and your cinematic curiosity can now find solace in other forms of storytelling."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The pacing of this film is utterly terrible. I could not believe it. For a ponderous protagonist who needs to ""hear the music"" and smell the roses in order to think, Christopher Nolan does not offer this luxury to the audience, were are barraged with an unintelligible uncomfortable narrative, flying at the constant pace of an Ocean's Eleven hiest scene; we are pelted with infinite cameos (everyone is in this film) rock and roll scientific revelations happening every few scenes (because of the frequency, each one feeling more meaningless than the next) everbody quips and there is a cut to a new scene every 7 seconds: cameo, quips, revelations, cut, famous qoute, cameo, lecture, quips, cut, 1940's iconography, cameo, cut, physics, war, cut, cameo, revelation, quips, cut. Nonsense.I've never seen so many cuts in a film before going at one constant blistering pace, it makes you feel sick. I was an hour in thinking this a form of torture, and there are two hours left. Every new character is presented in that 'matter of fact' way, like in the style of Wes Anderson, like they are props in a vignette, however in Oppenheimer it's happening every 30 seconds.Christoper Nolan seems to think intelligent people quip really fast and all the time. Women are either psychotically aloof, kinky for intelligence or Schizophrenic, which also would be the perfect way to descibe this film.The script is again like Hollywood gave 100 million dollars to a 22 year old Yale date-rapist, who's only seen three films; Ocean's Thirteen and two Bond movies, and asked him to write and direct a blockbuster revolving around the history of quantum physics, all while being perilously addicted to cocaine.The most hilarious scene in the film involves Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy with first mention of Oppenheimer's famous paraphrase of the Bhagavad-Gita ""I am the destroyer[...]"" etc. The scene is concieved of the most frat-boy 'whoa bro, this is so cool' logic you will every see to dramatise the life of a prominent physicist. I say dramatise, there is no drama or stakes in this film, again it's the pacing, nothing in this film carries any wieght.This film is not recommended for anyone with an anxiety disorder, vertigo, pregnancy (this film may harm the brain of a developing feotus) actually...let's just leave it at THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.I generously gave 2/10 stars. As even when your crazy toddler draws you a scribbled mess of a garbage picture, it still ends up on the fridge."
Review of Oppenheimer : Incredibly boring film. I couldn't wait for it to be over. The interested parts about the technology and science formed hardly any of the 3 hour movie. - meaning most of it was filmed with longgggggggg drawn our dialogue scenes.There's no likable characters. No one you want to root for - nothing.There's a way to shoot movies about dark parts of our history but this isn't the way. I could have turned the TV off at any point and couldn't care less if I never found out what happened ever again.I have nothing else to say that would be helpful other than don't bother - complete waste of time..
"Review of Oppenheimer : Now that the Oscars dust has settled, we can talk about Oppenheimer with a cool head.I like how Christopher Nolan, his fans and the ""professional"" film critics agree that the most important thing about Oppenheimer is whether or not he was a communist. After all, that is the central point of the movie, instead of exploring Oppenheimer's psychology and moral implications of creating the most destructive weapon in the history of mankind. ""But muh poisoned apple incident"" I hear the apologists say. There were more intriguing incidents in Oppenheimer's life than the apple, which are far more telling of his state of mind and what kind of a person he will become.When a 90 minute documentary called To End All War: Oppenheimer and the Atomic Bomb tells you more about Oppenheimer than a 3 hour biopic. Here are couple of quotes from it:
""When he finally went to camp one summer, he was so nasty to the other kids that they roughed him up. He said later they put him in the icehouse all night naked and painted him green, including his genitals. Oddly enough, Oppenheimer didn't protest. He just took his punishment stoically. It was a very odd reaction for a young boy at that age."" ""Imagine this sensitive boy, this very smart boy, but one who has no idea how to deal with other people. Certainly not with children his own age. He's had no experience."" It's a fascinating and disturbing episode from Oppenheimer's life, an episode which a more intelligent director would cleverly insert in their movie.What was the point of the Los Alamos countdown? Build ""suspense"" around something we all know was a success? And then Nolan doesn't even show us Oppenheimer's reaction to the explosion. Seriously, what was the point of this scene? Brilliant writing and direction. Twin Peaks Season 3 showed what an atomic bomb truly represents: pure evil, a symbolic loss of innocence, an infinitely more creative and creepier depiction of the same event. The ""weirdo"" David Lynch gets it, but not the ""genius"" Nolan.But, hey, at least Oppie wasn't a commie."
"Review of Oppenheimer : ""Oppenheimer"" 2023. Biopic of ""Father of the atomic bomb"" J. Robert Oppenheimer. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Starring Cillian Murphy and an all-star cast and multiple cameo appearances: Kenneth Branagh, Matt Damon, Gary Oldman, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and her girls, Robert Downey Jr, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Josh Harnett, Tom Conti, Jason Clarke, Tony Goldwyn, Matthew Modine, Benny Safdie, and Rin Tin Tin.""Oppenheimer"" is a pretentious film that tries too hard and leads with technique. For this viewer, the film's thudding emphasis on film-making technique, and its rejection of conventional storytelling, was alienating. I noticed how incredibly loud the movie is. It was like being at a rock concert. Some scenes are shot in black and white. Some scenes are shot in color. Each scene is very brief. Who characters are is entirely unclear. Narrative is broken up into bits, juggled, and disjointed. Scenes take place out of time sequence. The film covers Oppenheimer's life from when he was a grad student to his old age. I had no idea why Nolan played the film out of time sequence.The all-star cast and multiple cameo performances drew a great deal of attention to themselves. That attention, in addition to the film's other technical emphases, completely made it impossible for me to experience any willing suspension of disbelief. I never for one second forgot that I was watching a movie written and directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Cillian Murphy. I never for one second saw J. Robert Oppenheimer on screen. I saw actor and star Cillian Murphy, who has come a long way from ""Red Eye,"" back in 2005. I kept thinking about Murphy's performance choices as an actor. He doesn't so much hand in three hours worth of acting; he hands in the same performance for three hours. Murphy always speaks in the same flat, monotonous voice. He displays virtually no facial expressions.When Gary Oldman showed up in a cameo as Harry Truman all I could think was, ""Which star is going to show up next? Kim Kardashian as Eleanor Roosevelt?"" I recognized Kenneth Branagh but I had little idea of which historical figure he was playing and what significance that historical figure had to the plot. When Tony Goldwyn, in what may have been an extravagant wig, appeared onscreen, I just kept starring at his face thinking, ""I know this actor but I can't place who he is.""Florence Pugh plays the part of a snotty and doomed woman who has an affair with Oppenheimer. Pugh is topless in a couple of scenes and bottomless in one more scene. Again, all I could think about while watching these scenes was ""Boy, she really wants you to see her girls."" I didn't care about any of the so-called ""drama"" onscreen. I never cared about the character she played, about the real life woman on whom this character was based, or Oppenheimer's affair with this woman. It was all flat, lifeless, something attempting to be drama, but never quite getting there. Oh, and then there was more NOISE.Read the New York Times review of Oppenheimer. Manohla Dargis praises the film. All she talks about is technique. She talks about writer-director Christopher Nolan. She talks about Nolan's decisions as to how much atomic bomb horror to show onscreen. She talks about how LOUD the movie is. She talks about ""complex structure"" and ""the plasticity of the film medium."" ""Superb cinematography."" ""65 millimeter film"" ""black and white film"" Look, if you are fascinated by filmmaking technique, ""Oppenheimer"" is the film for you.I would have walked out, but I was with another person, so I had to sit through three hours of utter boredom and, yes, contempt for this pretentious film. Nolan is struggling so hard to create a work of art that approaches the seriousness of the atomic bomb. For me, he failed. I cared less about nuclear annihilation after watching the movie than before I entered the theater.A quieter, more intimate, more coherent, more old fashioned film could have moved me. Any number of incidents from Oppenheimer's life could have filled a two-hour film and ultimately said more about atomic weapons than this three hour exercise in noisy incoherence. Oppenheimer tried to murder his professor. That could have been a two-hour movie. Oppenheimer confronting the awesome task of developing a weapon capable of destroying the world. What Oppenheimer and others confronted in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Oppenheimer's marriage. Oppenheimer was a womanizer. He was a father who gave his children away when they annoyed him. He and his women liked to drink and smoke and they all seemed pretty lost. Focus on any one of these features could have made a moving film. Instead we get bombast, pretension, and a movie that never lets you forget who made it."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Christopher Nolan seems incapable of telling a simple story - and this is in effect a very, very simple story.His best films, Inception, Memento, use all kinds of time/dimension warping shenanigans to produce what are finally superb and engrossing movies.But give him a simple story, linear, regular-time-based - and he is completely lost.So here we have 3 hours of episodic, soap-opera style vignettes, one after another after another until it thankfully finishes.There is no forward momentum, no character development, just some good acting (as you would expect) and some OK cameos, Tom Conti as Einstein being the notable laugh out loud exception. (The cinema was full to capacity when I watched this film, and I have never heard so much sniggering.)
But in the end it's just dull! So so dull.C minus."
"Review of Oppenheimer : At least touch on the destruction caused to the actual city bombed, This film seemed to ignore the horrendous after effects for Japan and the people of Hiroshima . I Think chris Nolan needs to visit the peace museum in Hiroshima and read every individual story of men, women and children who lost livelihoods and suffered health defects generations after. There was not any Japanese representation and the only short scene that touched on it depicted American people. If you're going to make a film about a major tragedy in history, depict the death and devastation and long term ongoing damage caused."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The most disappointing movie I have seen in a long time. I was looking forward to this production and all the hype that came with it when released. This movie is no match to the BBC 7 part series made in 1980 which was smooth and could be followed easily by anyone. If it wasn't for the fact that I had seen the BBC production, I would not have known what really was going on in this movie. It is nothing but a dud and a waste of time watching it. But I watched all of the 3 hours and walked away extremely disgusted. The film doesn't even recognize the fact that the charges were exonerated after his death."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Christopher Nolan's first historical film. Yeah. Hopefully his last.I'm a fan of The Dark Knight Trilogy, I love Inception, but Tenet really struggled under the weight of its own concept. Through a confusing jumbled plot, the audience really has to concentrate to get any understanding from it, and it's draining and exhausting. This is the same with Oppenheimer. This is the current pattern in Nolan's films. Overcomplicated plot structures that begin to unravel before they even have a chance to entertain you.What could be a nice simple story about the man who created the Atomic bomb became a jumbled messy montage of the events through his life that you can't really figure out until the end. So throughout those 3 hours, you're left wondering who certain characters are, what their relevance is and therefore their scenes lose any meaning. You don't need to mess up the structure of a true story just to be clever or artsy, and it frustrates me when filmmakers do this. Some people prefer an intellectual story and to work it out as you go, like putting pieces of a puzzle together, and for example in Inception, this totally works. But for a historical piece? Nah, there's just no need to be clever with it.The first hour is quite intense with overloads of information in quick scenes that are set after the events of what you're about to watch, mixed together with flashbacks and present day stuff, and you're just left confused what happened when. I went in to learn about his life, but I came out more confused than before. I still don't know what took place when, but I got the overall gist of it.The overall message was decent. The idea of 'what have I created' showing us glimpses of the future is incredible and quite powerful. A very meaningful concept that is very true, why do we need to create such a weapon in the first place, and what the consequences of that are, probably eventually leading to our own destruction. His character is potent and Cillian Murphy plays it beautifully. But with the rushed dialogue and jumbled scenes you can't get any meaning until the last act, which really delivers. From the detonation scene about halfway through to the end is the interesting stuff I was after. However, the progression from experimenting with different types of bombs materials etc to suddenly having a ready bomb to test was very sudden and you didn't really get to see any of the physical development, it's just suddenly there and you're left wondering well how did they get there and what did they use to make it in the end. For me, I would have preferred more details about what they were doing and how they were doing it, I was interested in the process, much like we see in The Imitation Game. We are much more involved in his process and seeing his creation come to life - a brilliant example of what this film should have done. If you're going to show me a film about someone making an atomic bomb, show me how they do it. That's the interesting part!You have to pay very close attention to this film if you really want to understand it and what they're saying, but I'm not a fan of those types of films. This didn't need to be a clever mind twister, it just needed to be a nice historical piece on the man who created the atomic bomb. It doesn't need to be artsy. Simplicity is often appreciated.Also I can't see Robert Downey Junior as anyone other than Iron Man. He just acts the same.Overall, a decent strong message, but way too overdone and complicated. It doesn't need to be an intellectual puzzle to work out. I'm not paying to put together his life from the pieces you provide. Just tell me the story of his life and work, that's it. That's all you need to do. I feel exhausted after watching it, and I don't want to and shouldn't feel like that after watching a film. And the 3 hours. THEY DRAG!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : There's a joke in the Barbie movie where the Barbies distract the Kens by saying they've never seen the Godfather only to have it eagerly explained to them. Oppenheimer has now joined that illustrious list of films. This movie is such a pretentious, and I'm very confused by any means of the movie. The whole movie and the plot, the story, and the music itself is garbageA major folly in the writing here is that there are too many characters. Nolan was determined not to condense real life figures into fictional ones for brevity. There are so many characters whose introductions are barely highlighted but they become instrumental later on. Rami Malek's character is actually pretty damn important in the end, and both of us will be damned if Oppenheimer outgross this movie. The characters in Oppenheimer is such a naive, and flawed all at once, and the character development for Oppenheimer is 0. I don't even think it was mentioned until he pops up again when he is actually affecting the plot.I'm calling it a boycott of this movie due to some controversies."
"Review of Oppenheimer : ""Oppenheimer"" attempts to tackle the complex narrative of one of history's most pivotal figures, but unfortunately, it falls short on many fronts.The film's biggest flaw lies in its disjointed storytelling, bouncing between timelines in a hodgepodge manner that leaves viewers struggling to piece together the narrative. This non-sequential approach adds confusion rather than depth to the story.Furthermore, the decision to employ black and white filming feels more like a pretentious artistic choice than a meaningful storytelling device, adding little substance to the overall experience. Similarly, gratuitous nude scenes serve no purpose other than to titillate, detracting from any serious exploration of Oppenheimer's character or the historical events surrounding him.Speaking of character exploration, the film fails to depict Oppenheimer himself in any significant way, leaving viewers with a frustrating lack of insight into the man behind the project. Instead, it attempts to juggle multiple storylines, none of which are executed with any real depth or coherence.As a result, the film drags on longer than the very project it seeks to portray, with unnecessary loud music further exacerbating the tediousness of the viewing experience. Additionally, important characters from the Manhattan Project are poorly integrated into the narrative, further diluting the film's focus.Perhaps most disappointingly, the movie fails to convey the true importance of Oppenheimer to the project, leaving his contributions and complexities largely unexplored.In the end, ""Oppenheimer"" proves to be as boring as it is ambitious, failing to deliver a compelling portrayal of its subject matter or the historical events it seeks to dramatize."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The subject matter involves some of the most momentous events that have shaped our world. The science, the military and political context, the awful inveitability of the development of nuclear weapons, the arms race... the list of ingredients could not be more promising.The film won how many Oscars?So I was really looking forward to what promised to be one of the greatest films I'd ever seen.It turned out to be thoroughly underwhelming. Tedious, poorly cut... for the most part the acting was mediocre. Given the amazing subject matter, why did he spend so much of the film rooting around in Oppenheimer's personal life and his womanising? Wake up, there are big things happening out there! No, let's pick our metaphorical noses with a very poorly treated examination of the political manoeuvres that followed the war, the trinunals that were set up to discredit Oppenheimer's political associations and revoke his security clearance. OH PLEASE!Brevity is the soul of wit. 3 hours of this tedium... I didn't even reach the end. The washing up was more interesting."
"Review of Oppenheimer : My review is not based on the entire movie because I only managed to get through about 1 hour and 20 minutes before I finally lost the will to live. There is no way I could have put myself through another nearly 2 hours.I can't believe this movie gets so many high ratings? Why? It really is the most boring drivel I've ever watched (well for what I managed to watch). I knew what it was about, I knew it had a very good cast but I was expecting a lot more from it. However, its just so slow and boring and I just completely lost interest.I have no doubt it will probably win loads of awards/oscars etc. But all those awards are a farce as has been proven with various winners in recent years.Luckily I managed to watch this movie from the comfort of my home and I can only feel sorry for the people who went to the cinema to watch this. I can imagine there a lot of people who must have fell asleep half way through it.I'm just being honest and trying to save people from wasting their time. Don't trust those other reviews making out that this movie is a masterpiece because its one of the most boring movies I've ever seen."
"Review of Oppenheimer : For a movie that tries so hard to be original, it is abysmally banal.The music and sound effets are atrocious. The dialogues are ridiculously contrived (I mean some of them are so unnatural, it is actually funny). The narration is all garbled, it's a mess of timelines, irrelevant and undeveloped characters.I can't believe they actually tried to create suspense for an event that happened in the past (the bomb test). I mean, the viewers probably know (or can guess) that the world did not come to an end back then.Overall, Oppenheimer is a huge disappointment, and boy do I feel bad for people who went to see it in a theater."
"Review of Oppenheimer : In the realm of cinema, there are films that entertain, films that educate, and films that aspire to be something entirely different. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023) falls into the latter category, attempting to be a profound exploration of the man behind the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer. However, in its arduous pursuit of intellectual depth, the film stumbles into a mire of tedium and self-indulgence, leaving the audience stranded in a desert of endless dialogue and a dearth of engaging storytelling.From the outset, Oppenheimer establishes itself as a film that revels in its own seriousness. The pace is glacial, the atmosphere somber, and the dialogue heavy with weighty pronouncements about science, morality, and the human condition. While there's certainly merit in exploring such weighty topics, the film's execution is painfully lacking. The dialogue is often stilted and unnatural, lacking the flow and spontaneity that make characters feel real.The film's narrative structure further compounds its problems. Rather than adopting a linear approach that would allow the audience to connect with Oppenheimer's journey, Nolan opts for a fragmented, non-linear style. This decision, while intended to convey Oppenheimer's troubled mind and the disjointed nature of his life, instead serves to alienate the audience. The constant jumping back and forth in time makes it difficult to follow the narrative thread and establish any emotional connection with the characters.The film's excruciating length is another major hurdle. Clocking in at over three hours, Oppenheimer feels like an interminable slog. The film's lack of action or visual stimulation makes the prolonged duration even more unbearable. The audience is left to endure scene after scene of endless talking heads, their attention waning with each passing minute.The film's most egregious failing, however, lies in its utter lack of self-awareness. Nolan, seemingly oblivious to the film's shortcomings, appears to believe he has crafted a masterpiece. He lingers on shots of Oppenheimer's pensive face, as if expecting the audience to be captivated by his intellectual turmoil. He indulges in lengthy monologues about the nature of science and the responsibility of scientists, as if the audience were attending a philosophy seminar.The film's inflated hype, fueled by memes and the perception of it as an action-packed blockbuster, only serves to exacerbate the disappointment. Audiences expecting explosions, thrilling sequences, and a clear-cut hero vs. Villain narrative are met instead with a meandering, self-indulgent meditation on the complexities of the human psyche.Oppenheimer (2023) is a film that fails on multiple levels. Its narrative structure is convoluted, its dialogue is stilted, and its pace is glacial. The film's self-indulgent nature and lack of self-awareness further compound its problems, leaving the audience with a feeling of profound disappointment. While the film may have its merits in its exploration of complex themes, its execution is so flawed that it ultimately fails to deliver on its promise of intellectual depth."
Review of Oppenheimer : This movie did not live up to all the hype. I tried to watch it three times. I do not like it. It's very boring. There is nothing about the movie that grabs my attention at all. It just seems to move all of the place. I couldn't keep up with it. I'm sorry. I wouldn't waste my time watching it if I were you. I don't understand how Hollywood hypes all these movies up and then you watch them and they're boring. I gave it the old college try. I can't believe it's going to be up for all of these awards when I couldn't even keep my eyes or brain on the film at all. Movie was very boring Indeed. I tried.
"Review of Oppenheimer : I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, and I was really excited to see his latest film, Oppenheimer. I drove 45 minutes to the theater to see it in IMAX, and I was prepared to be blown away.Unfortunately, I was not. I found the movie to be boring, slow-paced, and visually underwhelming. The explosions looked like they were from free stock video websites, and the acting was not particularly good.I think the main problem with the movie is that it is too long and too ambitious. Nolan tries to cram too much into the film, and as a result, it feels bloated and unfocused. The film also suffers from Nolan's trademark convoluted editing style, which makes it difficult to follow at times.If Nolan was not the director of this film, I would probably give it a 2 out of 5 stars. It is not a terrible movie, but it is definitely not one of Nolan's best."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I can't believe everybody collectively gaslit me into thinking this movie was remotely decent.Watching this movie was one of the most boring experiences of my entire life. There was absolutely no reason for making this movie 3 hours long.They think they can save the movie by adding some nonsense nude scenes, but they refuse to actually explain the depth of the characters' relationships.The sudden changes in the timeline aren't explained well, nor is what happens in some scenes.Finally, yes, Cillian Murphy's acting is good, but when the plot is so boring, not even good acting can save it.I never write reviews, but I felt the need to tell you:
Do not let the internet gaslight you.Please do not waste your time."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Went to see this in IMAX last night with my son. He's been wanting to see it since it came out he loves history, I love physics, Engineering, etc. So booked... well with high expectations came huge let downs. The first hour or eternity as it felt was jarring jumping from one time line to another, the acting was adequate but the script was well all over the place. Then came the 2nd hour, now this was the only bit I liked the making of said Bomb. But again the throwing in of just ear breaking noise just to fill in time. Then the last hour we'll this is where I actually fell asleep. It was not needed it was long and boring with very poor acting from all. I really really can't see why people are raving about this. When I saw Nolan was directing I thought great.. wow I was wrong. I left feeling drained but from being utterly bored and let down. I'm still waiting for a decent film to come out something that we haven't had for a number of years now, this was not it.Just to add we know that hard hitting historical can be done and done well, Schindler's list being one! I have read through a lot of the 1 star reviews and they seem to all be written by fans of Nolan's, like them i enjoyed interstellar (maybe not the last 20 mins where it went off on a tangent)."
"Review of Oppenheimer : After you watch Oppenheimer and leave the movie theater, you ask yourself: ""What was the point of it?"" Unfortunately the answer is not clear at all. I strongly beleive that a movie about the scientist who played a key role in the creation of the atomic bomb should unquestionably emphasize on the consequences of this invention and send strong peaceful messages to the audience! Especially in the world we live in today! However, it looks like in the new movie Oppenheimer they almost ignore the tragic facts that hundreds of thousands of innocent people died from the first 2 bombs and that the whole world changed after Oppenheim's invention, which was obviously the biggest drama in this one human being's life. They emphasize and build the story in the movie around the fact that Oppenheimer was later accused of being a spy of the Soviets (who were allies to the Americans in WW2...).I feel sad that this will be an award winning movie and that most people in the audience will say (or feel they have to say) ""A! Oh!! Great movie!"", because the director, writers, cast are famous and the topic is important - all these superlatives about a somewhat boring movie, decorated with some nudity (not clear either why this was needed and related to the topic) and overall pointless movie... Or, at least, much more pointless than it should be!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion, but good Lord this film is BOOORRRING! Not one single character is set up to be anybody that we actually CARE about. We are told that this movie is spectacular, the acting is top tier and that we're supposed to love it. I don't know anything about filmmaking, but I DO know that I found nothing compelling about this movie. It's just a bunch of men talking for 3 hours. The entire film was one level, no peaks no valleys and no character arcs. I suppose it's an important story that needed to be told. Another important story that needed to be told was watergate. This movie feels a little bit like All the President's Men but All the President's Men WAS ACTUALLY AN EXCELLENT FILM, WHERE THIS ONE IS NOT! I'm so glad I waited until it was only $4.99 to rent on Amazon."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I had one more chance for Nolan after the garbage Tenet. And i have none now. This movie shows you how money talks in Hollywood. There is nothing good about this movie, there isn't any theme or clear conflict of the plot even. Everything is mixed together in this bore- fest auto biographic film. Its scenes are ripped off from other films and this film pretends it is bigger than it is with its over the top sound design. I don't recommend anyone to waste their time and money to this.No characther development, nothing you can relate. Soulless, passionless filmmaking. I couldn't believe what i was seeing."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Fictional portrayals of historical figures. Talk about Einstein a lot, but never mention Einstein's Nobel prize research. NEVER mention big name nuclear physics trailblazers.Poor acting. Everyone whispers, all the time, nobody in real life talks like that.No suspense.It is all people just talking to each other. Most movies have a sort of narrative journey building to a climax and resolution, but this movie failed in that.Technical and scientific dialogue is not accurate. There is very little discussion about nuclear physics or how the bomb works. Instead, a bunch of words everyone has heard are thrown in: ""The bomb is big in kilotons of tnt...The ball of plutonium will be 10 lbs and this big (FALSE! Actually is ~10cm diameter/radius and ~26 lbs).They cut the reasons why a implosion bomb was tested instead of the simple gun design.Read review title."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I was actually excited to watch this movie, and I was ready to be amazed.It was horrible. 3 hours of overacting in hopes of an academy award.How many times can you play loud bomb noises and think that wow, this will really deliver the message? The jumping from black and white to colorful was also annoying to me.The acting was sooooooo bad, like those funny short videos online, showing you tipical characters and tipical oscar worthy performances. All hundred hours of this movie looked like that.The dialogues.... Not one sentence in this movie felt honest, or real. Horribly long sentences with 10 random names in them, or short clever sentences you can put in the trailer.And it really did not need to be this long. Absolutely not. But it is worth noting that even if it would be only an hour long, it would still be bad. Because it is a bad movie."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer: A 3-Hour BorefestI recently watched Oppenheimer, and I have to say, it was one of the most boring films I have ever seen. The film is over three hours long, and it feels like every single minute of that runtime is spent on talking heads and exposition.The film tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer is a complex and conflicted figure, and I can understand why some filmmakers would want to explore his character and the moral implications of his work. However, Oppenheimer does so in a way that is incredibly dull and uninvolving.The film is almost entirely composed of dialogue, and most of that dialogue is either boring exposition or pretentious philosophical debates. The characters are all one-dimensional and uninteresting, and the film's pacing is glacial.The only thing that kept me from falling asleep during Oppenheimer was the fact that I was constantly waiting for something to happen. I kept thinking to myself, ""Surely, something exciting is going to happen soon."" But it never did. The film just droned on and on, and on and on.Finally, after three long and agonizing hours, the film ended with a whimper. There was no big climax, no satisfying resolution. It was just like the rest of the film: boring and uneventful.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It is a dull, tedious, and uninspired film that is simply not worth the time."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Long. Jumpy. Incredibly annoying soundtrack. No character build up. Two dimensional script. Flat performances.Superficial, wooden, heartless, over-the-top, big-budget Hollywood atomic snooze fest. A tsunami of rapid, cheesy dialogue, random characters who contribute nothing to the story, frenetic time jumps and grating, misplaced soundtrack music.I'm a big Nolan fan but this is unquestionably a massively overhyped quantum turd.This movie should be packaged into the large hadron collider and vaporised into another universe far far away. On a positive note if you have a sleep disorder this is the movie event of the century, as you'll sleep like a baby after the first 23 minutes.Apart from that it was great."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Absolute tedious shite. Dont bother. I've NEVER before walked out of a film but after 1 hour of this 3+hr film Id had enough.If it was on TV id have turned it off after first 10 minutes. But as I was in the imax I gave it a longer chance. After an hour of watching a film try very hard to be 'profound and powerful' but boring me to death I had to check some online reviews under my jumper. Trying to make a dull film interesting by repeatedly flashing up (the same) pictures of stars, flames and faux electron clouds with crashing 'music' does not make it interesting. Just read the history online. It wont take you 3 hours.It was so awful even the lure of an imax nuclear explosion couldnt tempt me to stay!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : Don't really know where to start.Was really excited to watch this film, since I love Physics, Maths, Sc-Fi..etc.. and I'm not that hard to please.But this film is nothing about anything to do with the bomb, the research, the physics, how it was constructed, the devastating consequences of it.This is just pure politics, a deconstruction of the inner demons of Oppenheimer and his affairs.As regards Oscars, awards, give me a break.Murphy looked good because everyone else in the film was diabolical and not their fault.The female characters, who are good actresses in their own right, deserved more than this, especially Florence Pugh
who was brilliant in ""Fighting with my Family""And Matt Dameon with the moustache as the General who is usually very good was a joke. Not Matt's fault.I'm giving this 1 star. Watched about the first 1 hour and couldn't stomach any more. Fell asleep twice."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Nothing happened for the first 30 minutes so I switched it off & went back to reading my extended edition of the works of Grunthos the Flatulent. My life is too short and I have too much to do to spend it on this nonsense.There's something terribly self-indulgent about taking a fascinating story and stretching it so thin that you begin to doubt that even quantum fluctuations could fill the vacuum that is the utter void that is the first part of this film. I found myself actually unable to watch beyond the long tedious opening void. Possibly, something happens later on but waiting around to find out seemed like a futile waste of time and mental bandwidth. What an utter waste a hugely talented cast."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I guess since this is a story surrounding an important American context, it is doing well with American viewers. But boy, just take one step back and see the cinematographic mess that Nolan made.The story is hard to follow, it swings back and forth in time. As the aging of Cillian Murphy is not done that well, it's hard to follow where we are and how this fits into the broader story. Scenes are short and unrelated, so now fluid story, no time to built up to something.Characters are put into play without context. It is assumed you immediately know all about them, their background, names, what they have achieved. You need to have studied science to understand why they are there.Cillian Murphy is as charismatic as a flattened snail on the road. He just doesn't captivate the viewer. I know he is getting a lot of praise for his role in Peaky Blinders, but only the first 3 seasons where worth a watch. He looks as if he is not really motivated or interested to play Oppenheimer. Emotionless, boring, just doesn't add anything.And I must comment about the sound editing. My god. I know this is a Nolan movie and he does this all the time. The music, or actually, the noist is set at a too high volume and the speech at too low volume. As a result you need to turn up the volume to hear the characters but that is drowned out by the constant intrusive noise that should go for ""music""."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I will start by confessing that I have disliked nearly everything Nolan has done. He is a charlatan of a filmmaker. He has ""The Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome"". He likes to think he makes clever, deep, and challenging films, but they are in fact, shallow and generally average.I like the topics he takes on, but his execution is clumsy to say the least; It would seem massive plot holes don't seem to bother his fans.Oppenheimer isn't one of his Sci-Fi fancies though, so I thought maybe he might have found another genre to deliver on. Unfortunately, without the Sci-Fi angle to fall back on, its 3-hour drivel bore fest.What was the point of this film. Oppenheimer as a character, isn't particularly interesting, he doesn't have any amazing life journey. He basically Project Managed the creation of a bomb. Seriously 3 hours to tell that story. When I say that, I mean, not even tell the bloody story. Flip flop with timelines, lots of quick cuts, tons of boring chats. Throw in some B&W footage, that seems trendy, why not.The Shadow Makers (aka Fat Man and Little Boy) did a pretty decent job of showing the real story. This was just a jumbled mess of a filmmaker desperately trying to look clever and failing miserably.Cillian Murphy was very good I have to say, but I can't give this toilet water anything more than a 1/10.EDIT: Spelling."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Why did it feel like a huge tv series recap of thrown together highlights to give you the back story of the next season lol! Felt like a super long trailer! After 20 mins I was thinking hope it's starts soon, after 1 hour ""when is this film going to start?"" After a few hours in I was bored and looking at the time.I love Christopher Nolan. Love! And have from the beginning, memento to inception, the Batman's to interstellar. The guy is a genius. And has blown the world away.But...Look let's all just be super realistic right now and honest with ourselves. This film was not it! Okay if you truly loved it and it was the movie you needed in your life and it satisfied all your expectations and gave you hope in cinema again, I'm super happy for you and glad you enjoyed it. But you have got to be in the minority of people, because I think people will just say it's awesome out of respect to the big names. It was just so messy and was trying to hard. Just give us the story! Build your characters! And let the actors act! Let us actually feel something! If you want to do it artsy then give us a 'there will be blood' vibe! I personally would like to know the history and the people of what happened and to actually feel something about this crazy time of the world but it was done in such I just didn't feel much.And it was in fact ...Boring.Okay I'm not movie expert but I love cinema, im actually a video editor so it's a huge part of my life, I'm not an immature film lover who needs all the super fake unrealistic garbage that gets thrown out these days. So I was super hyped for this one. But this film was boring! Interesting at times and a few things I liked. But if we are doing a film about nuclear bombs let us be full of fear like they must have been, give us the true horrific truth about setting off a nuclear bomb.Anyway
Glad people enjoyed it. Hope CN brings more films out soon. I just hope someone comes and saves movies and we walk into a time of unbelievable films. Because I'm just tired and actually want to be entertained."
"Review of Oppenheimer : If this movie got 7 Oscars I am sure that I will get at least one for my extremely boring home-movie with my mother-in-law in the back yard swimmingpool. It's only 30 min but in the same class.I was looking forward to this movie as I have read a lot about the Manhattan project, about Oppenheimer himself and, most interesting of all, about Gen Leslie Groves and his more than 100 projects.Bought it on DVD, loaded it, sat down in the best chair with a beer and then I fought for three hrs to stay awake.I am either stupid or ignorant so please, someone, explain to me the greatness of this movie. Is there anything I miss?"
"Review of Oppenheimer : Good performances. Good characterizations.And... that's all3 hours speaking, 3 hours of interrogatories, trial alike and so onSuch a boring film nobody is going to watch twice.Horribly boring film with no action, only people talking and talking about really uninteresting things.They tried so hard to make viewers feel something increasing the noise level at some points: free explosions or bumps for no reason, strange loud violinists, turning up the music BECAUSE YOU MUST FEEL THE EMOTION, THE SITUATION, even if nothing happens. So overrated film. Crap.You will never learn how hard they worked to make an A-bomb, it's all about politics and tribunal, THAT'S ALL."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I did not enjoy this movie. The trailer led us all to believe it would be about the development of the atomic bomb. Instead it was a very convoluted and hard to follow story about the witch-hunt that followed involving Oppenheimer. Tedious in the extreme and way too long. What I disliked most of all was the nerve jangly, incessantly loud and constant soundtrack noise. I know Nolan likes to do this but it was out of control in this movie. It was like leaving your teenage boy to play death metal at full bore whilst you are try to meditate! I must have looked at my watch 50 times as to when it would be over. I very much appreciated Nolan's storytelling talents, and the excellent acting, but seriously, edit this movie please. I suggest a test audience cut instead of the directors cut."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Had so high expectations. Wanted something spectacular, something meaningful, cathartic. Existential drama of intellect and destruction. Insight into the mind of Oppenheimer and the Trinity project.Instead got 3 hours of 5 seconds long TikTok clips. Oppenheimer being accused. Being a communist. Interrupted by loud sounds, flashes and firework footage. On a level, I am not sure if it was less annoying than a young children shouting the same random nonsense mixed goat sounds and farting in a vertical video.Plus point for the fine ladies in incomplete cloting.I hope at least the Barbie movie is better."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I discovered this film to be excessively intricate, unnecessarily lengthy, and somewhat challenging to sit through. The acting, notably from Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy, is commendable, however, the relentless and simplistic portrayal of the American perspective becomes rather wearisome. Moreover, it missed a chance to delve deeper into illustrating the profound impact of the bomb on Japan.Not sure why this movie is/was shown at IMAX but I'm glad I watched it at home over two days because I almost fell asleep twice.This movie is an hour too long and probably one of Christopher Nolan's worst films."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Again the usa is shown as the good boys fighting evil, they didnt show scenes tha compromise the great americans, no scenes of the bomb or the japanese people, if you want to see a good movie that shows some scenes about the war, try the movie of Marie Curie that is a British movie that has balls ro show japaneses playing, children and honest adults when the bomb falls in Nagazaki. The director of oppenheimer is not so good, so I was expecting nothing more than a fictional grade 5 movie. The movie is boring, confusing but at least show that americans cant trust even in their own scientists, they made a witch hunt for the ones that they considered a menace for the nation, some questions werent answered, important questions as what hapenned to oppenheimer? Did he stay working for the government, was he tempted to change sides after seeing that the government didnt trust him? What happened to the city near the tests place?"
"Review of Oppenheimer : It's been many months since I first saw it but I'm at a real loss at how people and critics loved this movie. Like most people, I knew the basics of ""The father of the atomic bomb"" and that's about it. The first two hours of this movie were a darn mess of sloppy writing. The plot and script would've worked only if I was a former Oppenheimer biographer! We know he invented the atomic bomb and that's literally it. The majority of Americas don't know he went through a series of hears decades later and became an opponent of the weapon. But the movie starts that way, and keeps flipping back to it, without reference to any year or wtf is actually happening. I'd say the first two hours were pure trash. I had zero clue what was happening. He seem together the time flip sequences was just ridiculous and burdening. I felt that seeing it in the theater was actually a detriment, because some of the sequences were so damn loud They were deafening! Yes, deafening! The music, the explosions, etc. Would frequently out pace any verbal language. It was ridiculous. There's better ways to tell the story of a genius man who saved the lives of millions of Americans, with great internal strife. This was just not a good way of doing so."
"Review of Oppenheimer : I held off seeing this movie until it was available to buy on Prime, and I don't think I've ever been more underwhelmed by a film relative to the hype. The scenes were cut in a very confusing way, there was a loud annoying stomping soundtrack that appeared in scenes that didn't need it, and the plot focused on some of the less interesting aspects of the Manhattan project. Why spend so much on a hollywood blockbuster and focus the plot around the security clearance and idiosyncrasies of one person and retrodding on themes about nuclear weapons that we've heard for decades in countless other films? I've studied WWII for years and feel fairly educated in the manhatten project, and I found the plot found the most boring way possible to portray the period, the project and the people involved.And then there's the...explosion. So much hype about the explosion scene and how CGI wasn't used, and it showed. Anyone can go on youtube and see the trinity blast and dozens of other nuclear blasts, and the one shown in this film did NOT look like a nuclear blast. It looked like a slow motion close-up of a gas can exploding."
"Review of Oppenheimer : An honest view from a good fan of Nolan's work ; The protagonist is definitely worth a movie, the story is very interesting, the cast is first class but I sincerely think that the movie is overdone ...Some aspects of the movie are just useless ; the sex scenes are fade, inhuman... I felt that I did not get out of the movie knowing Oppenheimer more.It's true that the explosion scene was a master class but again Nolan has all the means to unleash some quality scene like these. Action and technical scenes are nothing fancy for him !Gary Oldman ; LEGENDARY in very few shots.Clearly, the means were there, the story, the cast but the mixture was overdone ...I cannot help but say that there were better biopics ; a beautiful mind, the theory of everything, ... this one not that crazy.The SCORE was forgettable ... very much so !"
"Review of Oppenheimer : The build up to the main event that everyone waits for is great. The SFX is fantastic. The music is fantastic. However the second Leg of the film is quite boring and pretty uninteresting. I would probably class the film in the lower end of nolan's films. The acting is however great, performances were probably some of the best. I've seen this year. Certain scenes that have been mentioned a lot in the media, I do agree are not necessary and had no impact on my experience of the film and it did feel out of place. Personally, I would not recommend this film to anyone and do not recommend this film to anyone unless you are a serious film buff who needs to watch all the movies that get released."
"Review of Oppenheimer : The film proves engaging on a global level, even though some parts are tedious. However, it's truly senseless that the remarkable Enrico Fermi has received inadequate visibility. He embodies the crucial figure who provided fundamental guidance to all other characters, playing an essential role in the project's realization. For those who might not know, it's important to underline that Fermi is the inventor of the reactor, a contribution without which the achievement of atomic energy would have remained an unattainable goal, significantly altering the course of history. The film's message resonates-Fermi's legacy demands recognition."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Found it borning and confussing at times, but comes together in a full circle by the end. Found it to be to long and could have been shorter. Acting was amazing. Did not recognize some of the name actors until they showed some sort of mannerism. Based of a true story, I did find it interesting on historical events. We are always agaist other nations to be ahead and this was no different. I being 51, I took my dad and he was very pleased with everything and really enjoyed watching the movie. His comment was and that was history in a nut shell, and all the behind the sense I bet that still happens today."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a sweeping, epic, and visually stunning film that tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. The film is long (nearly three hours) and complex, but it is also incredibly engrossing and thought-provoking.Nolan's direction is masterful, and he uses his trademark visual style to create a film that is both visually arresting and emotionally powerful. The film is shot in IMAX, and the images are stunning. The film's score by Ludwig Göransson is also excellent, and it perfectly complements the film's visuals.The performances in Oppenheimer are all top-notch. Cillian Murphy gives a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer, and he is supported by an excellent cast that includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Kenneth Branagh.Oppenheimer is not an easy film to watch. It deals with some heavy subject matter, and it is not afraid to show the dark side of science and technology. However, it is also a film that is ultimately hopeful, and it suggests that even the most destructive forces can be used for good.Overall, Oppenheimer is a masterpiece. It is a film that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally powerful. It is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it.Here are some of the things I liked about the film:The performances were all excellent, especially Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer.The visuals were stunning, especially the IMAX scenes.The score by Ludwig Göransson was excellent.The film dealt with some heavy subject matter in a thoughtful and intelligent way.Here are some of the things I didn't like about the film:The film was long (nearly three hours).The film could be slow-paced at times.The film's ending was a bit ambiguous.Overall, I highly recommend Oppenheimer. It is a film that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally powerful. It is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Atomic breakthrough is not shown but kept behind the curtain, which only keeps you assuming of what happens actually happens from periodic conversations between scientists and etc. Doesn't show the horrors of atomic consequences. I wanted to see him being tormented emotionally after seeing what happened in Japan and etc. Deep political film, focusing on military mid WW2 and post WW2 drama typical pursuits of Americans after Russians/communists with it's deep paranoia which lingers till date. Oscar worthy by a lead actor but a let down overall, knowing Nolan this is second best after Tenet!!!!!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : This very heavily marketed, promoted and hyped film was hugely disappointing. The acting is outstanding and there is some good writing, but it is riddled with unnecessary and ineffective narrative gimmicks and visuals of explosions, space, sub-atomic particles etc. They might have worked if used with better judgment and discernment, but they don't. They're just annoying and tiresome. Same goes for the heavy-handed and over the top score. I felt that most of this was in service of the director's ego rather than the film itself.I quite like Christopher Nolan films - Memento was excellent - but this was tedious drivel.I watched the 1980 BBC series (on Amazon) after watching the film and, old-fashioned though it was, thought it was much better (although closer to 7 hours rather than 3). Some of the scenes in the earlier series reminded me of scenes in this film (eg the countdown and explosion of the Trinity test."
"Review of Oppenheimer : To be fair I had a bad seat stuck in the corner. Also, there was something with the audio in the film or theater. I couldn't make out parts of the dialog over the background/scene noise.Too much time spent on Oppenheimer himself, wanted to know more about the other scientists. Political intrigue bores me. Should have spent more time on the women in his life or don't cover it at all.Could have watch a 3-hr movie of scientists in a room talking the theory and math of quantum physics even if it was just the surface level stuff I already know.I took Matt Damon's advice and left after the trinity event."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Saw Oppenheimer in IMAX format. It's a decent enough biopic but itvsuffers from an unjustified grandiose directorial style. Nokan's insistence on film vs digital and penchant for unnecessary melodrama make it seem like more of a major work than it actually is. It's worth seeing, to be sure, but I think it's one of those overhyped productions that will be lost in the dusty film archive where pomposity goes to die.The sound level, which the theater insists was set according to strict instructions from the studio, was abusively loud. My hearing threshold was messed up for hours after the viewing. Bring ear protection if you see it in theater, just in case. Actually this film just barely justifies theater viewing - - it's probably more enjoyable to simply watch on your big screen at home."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Overall a good movie. It was very limited in terms of seeing any sort of action. In fact, there was basically no action throughout the entire movie. The best part of the movie is the dialogue - and it is very dialogue heavy. Definitely not the best if you have ADHD or aren't in the mood to sit down and devote your entire attention span to the film. Also the movie was too long they could have done the entire movie in two hours instead of three. I felt ready for it to be over by the time it actually ended. It's the type of movie that you may want to watch once, but would likely never watch again."
"Review of Oppenheimer : We are not Americans, so we had the advantage of not being familiar with the political intrigue surrounding the A-bomb story. We went in with high expectations, stimulated by the the M&M-frenzy (Media and Marketing).We came out a little confused. Was this what we hoped to get?We had seen some excellent acting, fine photography and a sometimes gripping story. I learned a bit about American politics.Unfortunately, a mediocre script, chopped up by dreadful editing kept us on our toes the whole time, trying to figure out who was who, what was this persons' relevance and what happened when.There was no subtlety. Once every two minute we were jolted out of our seats by sudden heavy sounds, presumably aimed at waking us up. Yes, they got our attention. Also, some characters were given parts to play that left nothing to be imagined. Strauss, for instance, came across as untrustworthy from the first glance he gave the camera. The president, in his brief encounter with Oppenheimer, was clearly pictured as a man without any doubts or pity,I would call this movie an excellent superficial story. With shortcomings.A bit of a disappointment."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Yes, it is a very average movie but hyped by the audience. Nolan fans have rated movie very well because they experienced the placebo effect. The movie is nothing special. I must acknowledge that the acting of every actor in the movie is top-notch. What I felt was bad, is the way storyline was presented; nothing creative was tried. Also, the movie is very dialogue intensive. At the end of the movie, I just felt that a lot of facts were poured into my head. Direction is slightly above average. From the perspective of students persuing science in graduation, the movie doesn't have much part of science; they could have showed how great Oppenheimer was in terms of his academic achievements and what all he did, instead, they choose to just say in a one-liner through dialogues!!!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : I simply can't like this movie. It wants to say way too much and says way too little about way too many things. It can't decide what it wants to be, so it's not really anything - not just for the viewer, but for the creator. And that's a problem. It's not good as a biopic: there are serious historical flaws in the story, which irritated me. I'm a huge fan of John von Neumann... anyone, who knows who he was understands why I mention him. As a drama? The movie can't decide the centre of the drama. It's too weak as a spy-story, too weak as a political drama, too weak as a personal drama. Not one aspect is worked out to carry the film. The strongest aspect was how many times in american history the ""what you did 20 years ago is more important than who you become and what your expertese is"" ruined people's lives. Or at least was used as a political rethoric against opponents. And I appreciated that, hence the 5 points. As a moral/personal evolution the moral conflict isn't built up, the ""evolution of a scientist"" dies away halfway and doesn't really connect with the ""organizer scientist"". The ""science should or should not have moral boundaries"" isn't worked out and built up, just comes and goes without a purpose. The only detactable personal evolution is the ""man of future becomes the man of past"", but somehow that remains too weak in the end, too. So the movie falls apart and not even the brilliant actors and the massively impressive explosion scene can hold it together.I couldn't help feeling how Nolan this time couldn't feel the fine line of balance... that ""sometimes less is more""."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer starts switching between past, present and somewhere in between from the get go. As a result the first hour is a chaotic, weird paced struggle to get trough.Then Matt Damon's character gets introduced and the movie starts to become more streamlined and interesting. Too bad it returns to the boring, weird paced style in the last hour.Most of the characters were well acted but i didn't feel any investment because of the boring dialogue and story. I wasn't rooting for a single character.Boring dialogue got mixed with tense music which just felt off. Overal quite boring and a let down."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Acting, Production design is good but they gave too much hype for the movie since I expected good VFX such as in Interstellar, Inception, Tenet etc.In the movie, reading the Gita quote during an intimate scene is VERY BIG INSULT to the sentiment of Hindus, not only in India but throughout the world. If it would have been Bible or Quran, would they include it in the scene? Never, because their religious sentiments get hurt (Irony!!)Didn't expect this from Chris Nolan. He is my inspiration and hero for his ultimate dramatic and visually baffling movies but his character is degraded to such an extent that he wrote the screenplay for THAT scene in such a manner.Let's fight to remove that intimate scene from the movie all over the world!!!"
"Review of Oppenheimer : Oppenheimer is a long, slow-burning film that is not for everyone. The film is over three hours long, and it can be quite dull at times. However, the soundtrack is excellent, and the film's middle section is particularly well-done.The film tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. The film is well-acted, with Cillian Murphy giving a standout performance as Oppenheimer. However, the film's length and slow pace can be a major drawback.If you are a fan of Christopher Nolan's films, you may enjoy Oppenheimer. However, if you are looking for a more exciting or fast-paced film, you may be disappointed.Here is a more detailed review of the film:Pros:
Excellent acting, especially by Cillian Murphy
Beautiful cinematography
Excellent soundtrack
Thought-provoking themes
Cons:
Too long
Slow pace
Mind-numbingly dull at timesOverall, Oppenheimer is a well-made film with some excellent performances. However, the film's length and slow pace may be a major drawback for some viewers. I would recommend the film to fans of Christopher Nolan's films, but others may want to wait for it to be released on streaming."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Bla bla bla three hours of talking and talking and still more talking..............
A very long and very boring movie that did not touch on the Japanese or Soviet side......
Where is the bomb? How did they drop it? What happened before and after?This movie is more biography than a cinematic masterpiece sadly...........
Soundtrack was nice but still not enough to sit three hours watching men talking and talking.This movie could be a scene from a real movie about the blast in Hiroshima or the atomic bomb..........
Anyway some ppl enjoyed it, I didn't.........
All guys were going to watch Barbie, I understand why."
"Review of Oppenheimer : Long movies are not the problem, look how successful harry potter and avatar are. The issue is, this was basically a really long board meeting that lasted longer then Avatar the way of water. Somehow I feel like attending a legit real board meeting would have been more intresting then watching this. However it was very informative and the actors played their roles very well. If your not intrested in learning about the history of how the atomic bomb was created then you wouldn't enjoy watching this. 9/10 acting 7/10 runtime 6/10 plot and overall I feel like they executed an average of 7.5 to 8 of 10."
Review of Oppenheimer : Me & husband & my son 18 feel asleep first of all though it hard to understand so boring a lot of talk and depressing and why talk and promote bombs and killing people am 53 and husband is 55 we all did not like it at all !! My mom & dad saw it and they are in late 70s they did not like it at all they said it was slow a lot of talking and a depressing drama I Can NOT believe why it's winning just because it has famous A list people in it ! I don't know why others are saying it is good when me and my family don't think it's good at all ! Sooo boring Depressing it's a good movie to fall asleep to I guess!
"Review of Oppenheimer : Christopher Nolan looks more like an indie director making movies in Hollywood. He breaks the traditional recipe of the blockbuster popcorn movie with a plot rather interested in breaking up the story of a WWII character, than in making a story of high intensity and drama, as is the type of Hollywood cinema. I'd say the movie is OKAY, but people and pop culture aren't ready for 3 hours of Oppenheimer getting in trouble for his ""uncertain"" communist party relation, and his bad vibes with his boss.I think it would be better if he had cut it and had kept just the final hour and a half. It would had been perfectly understood.If you havent watched the movie, this might be a great slogan: a Feature Film of a man Struggling with his Colleagues."
