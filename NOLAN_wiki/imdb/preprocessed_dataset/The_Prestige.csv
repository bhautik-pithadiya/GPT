Review
"Review of The Prestige : Great movie with Great actors writers and twists.Something that i didn't see anybody said about it that rivalry between two magicians is reference to Tesla and Edison's rivalry.
In the beginning they worked together, then became opponents. I think Borden is Tesla cause he always was more talented than Angier (Edison) who stole Borden's idea.Surely on of the best movies in this century, be sure to watch it more than one time."
"Review of The Prestige : I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other ""popular"" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with ""Memento"" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of ""Memento"" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full ""interchange"" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more ""wrong"" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most ""complex"" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of ""Prisoners"" (2013) and ""Logan"" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special ""10/10"" and an ""A+""."
"Review of The Prestige : The Prestige, adapted from an award winning novel of the same name by Christopher Priest, is an intricate tale of passion, intrigue, deceit and obsession about two illusionists, whose morbid covetousness for absolute supremacy in their profession engenders a fierce rivalry that turns internecine and ultimately consumes them. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) at the start of their careers are highly ambitious young men assisting an elderly illusionist named Milton. Borden's incessant longing for innovation leads to the accidental death of Angier's wife. Borden marries Sarah and his apparent happiness further aggravates the sense of revulsion in Angier's heart. Angier's vindictive intervention during a bullet catch trick causes Borden to lose his two fingers. Though these events sowed the seeds of implacable hatred, but it is the unremitting yearning of their perpetually insatiable egos to outperform each other that eventually drives them to perdition.Angier starts performing with the sobriquet ""The Great Danton"" with Cutter (Michael Caine) as his illusion engineer, while Borden with the stage name ""The Professor"" with Fellon as his engineer. Angier is an adept showman, but lacks the technical prowess. On the contrary, Borden is highly skillful, but lacks the taste for grandeur and showmanship. Each regards the other as his only obstacle (owing to their bitterly intertwined past) and this starts a series of events in which each tries to stymie the other by any means possible (sabotage, abduction, incrimination and even killings). Awed by the apparent genuineness of Borden's version of ""The Transported Man"" and inveigled by Borden's deliberate misdirection, Angier travels miles and spends a fortune to approach an ingenious scientist named Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) in order to cajole him into building a machine for him (a machine that could help him outperform Borden). Nikola Tesla is an apostle of Alternating Current (and rightly thinks it to be superior to Direct Current), and is under immense pressure imparted by Thomas Edison (ruthless advocator of Direct Current) and his men, who are after Tesla. As Edison's men close in on him, Tesla runs out of time and hence funds for his research and is forced to oblige Angier, who is his very last client. Tesla flees the scene shortly after fulfilling his promise to Angier (not without leaving him a strong note of caution against the use of his invention), whose ever increasing skepticism in Tesla is placated by the efficacy of his masterful invention. Using Tesla's machine, Angier introduces his own version of ""The Transported Man"", which becomes an instant success, but in lieu of a terrible self-sacrifice (that Angier has to make every night while performing). As the story culminates, the viewer is startled with many revelations including the mental and physical torments that Borden's complex character undergoes owing to his total devotion towards his art.The success of an act of illusion solely depends upon the deftness with which its three parts viz. the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige are performed. Similarly, for a movie to be a success, its three main aspects i.e. screenplay, direction, and acting are ought to be top-notch. Christopher Nolan incredibly manages to strike all the right cords with The Prestige. His riveting maneuvers coupled with his ingenious auteur skills aggrandize the brilliance of the movie ten-fold. Nolan succeeds in having a dream assemblage of actors with almost everyone giving a memorable performance. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are superb in their lead roles. Michael Caine shines in his low-key portrayal of Cutter, an ordinary part made to appear extraordinary through sheer brilliance; vintage Caine. David Bowie as Nikola Tesla and Andy Serkis (Gollum of LOTR) as Alley (Tesla's assistant) are stupendous in their cameos. Scarlet Johansson also manages to give a scintillating portrayal as Borden's paramour, Olivia.The movie is a roller-coaster of a ride with intriguingly intertwined subplots and masterful time switching, which makes it one of a kind and an ultimate masterpiece. The uncanny feat of Nolan to manifest a motion picture, which forays the realms of Mystery, Thrill, Sci-fi and Fantasy, is truly exemplary and makes the movie a contemporary classic. The movie is a tapestry of twists and turns, which evinces its overwhelming potential to bewitch the masses and satiate even the most esoteric viewers. The questions that it incessantly asks of the viewers can only be answered after repetitive viewings, with each viewing seeking utmost attention of the viewer. The only question that I would ask of the viewer is: ""Are you watching closely?"" A must watch for anyone, who has nothing against giving his mind a rigorous exercise and his body an adrenaline rush. 10/10"
"Review of The Prestige : I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!"
"Review of The Prestige : I couldn't help myself. I just kept saying ""wow, what a beautifully crafted film,"" all the way home, and around my house when I arrived home. I have not been so captured and entertained in a long time. I was especially enamored with the screen writing and how tightly and beautifully the visual metaphors tied in with the writing, and with the impact of the human message about obsession, competition and retribution carried to the extreme. One can relate to this personal human struggle for victory over another at all costs on a much grander scale, as the two magicians could easily be symbolic of how leaders of countries come to blows with each other, at the expense of their women and children -- something we struggle with right now in our world. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time.Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Sir Michael Caine all contributed stunning, emotional performances. Rebecca Hall, who played Sarah to Bale's Alfred Borden, turned in a highly charged performance as well, making Scarlett Johansson's Olivia flat in comparison. And although some people thought the plot line a bit tedious, I found it to be refreshingly complex and engaging, while not being so complex as to lose you. If you can't follow this one, you've been watching television too long. And who cares if the illusions are mundane or scientifically unbelievable? Isn't that what both movies and illusions ask us to do? To suspend disbelief? Meantime, there's a message in its madness. Hello.The film is visually moody and evocative, easily transporting you into the time period. What more could you ask for? A film is a visual medium and this one is a visual ten. The acting is superb as well as the plot. It keeps you interested; it keeps you guessing right to the shocking but most appropriate end.It asks you, what is one willing to sacrifice for the ""prestige?""I think this one's an Oscar definite."
"Review of The Prestige : I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no  wrong.  Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and  Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's  Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy)  cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live  up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the  other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist.  The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and  second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to  its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge  magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting  the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough  engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It  tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned  unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession,  revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each  other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life  and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are  perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can  sometimes be used as tools for deceit.  What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the  notion of how ""magic"" actually worked. Besides the better understanding  of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty  assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience,  somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to  spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More  importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal  engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely  for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be  detrimental to any leaks of secrets.  And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible  for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction  that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I  thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading  the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark  character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of  sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert  Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of  penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds  with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly  muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that  there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of  grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for  survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot  running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett  Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower  vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn  between the rivals added a little gravitas.  The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The  soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood  appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian  scientist!   I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the  non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to  use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so  fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in,  without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You  just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with  time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours,  you don't feel its length at all.  At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection -  what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to  describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in  general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie  to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you  absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural  choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none  other.  P.S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's  movies?"
"Review of The Prestige : I have to say this is one of the best movies i have seen this year, i was not expecting it to be that good. There's twist after twist, and when you think there is no more, there will be. Great performances and ever better plot. I highly recommend this movie to all ages.New idea for a movie, and they succeeded it at it greatly. It will have you thinking every time you see a magician on TV!i had to give this movie a 10/10, and i only have 4 movies that i would rate that way in my life time. If there is anything you do this year, make it a trip to watch this movie!I hope you enjoy it as much as i did."
"Review of The Prestige : Leaving the theater, I thought the film was just okay. An hour later, I thought it was pretty clever. And now, the next day, I think it was amazing. Why the change? It took that long for most or all of the subtle hints to sink in and the real twists to be discovered. The film doesn't end when you leave, it begins.The story is the tale of two magicians in a bitter rivalry, always trying to do a better trick than the other and trying to sabotage the other's success. At least, that's what you think the story is until you finally see ""the prestige"".I can't discuss much of this film because giving almost anything at all away would ruin some of the fun. But a few notes: Christian Bale, as always is awesome. An incredible actor with a wide range and screen appeal. Christopher Nolan works well with him (see ""Batman Begins"") and I hope they continue this Burton-Depp relationship they have. I foresee only greatness.Hugh Jackman is also spectacular, probably giving the most diverse performance in the film, easily the most demanding. And he does this convincingly.Scarlett Johannson is Scarlett Johannson... if you've liked her before, you should like her here (though her role never really gets the full story it needs). And David Bowie... wow, he is so much better than ""Labrynth"" would have you believe.The visuals are stunning, but the real credit goes to the makeup department, who deserve an Oscar for this picture. Outside of horror films where extensive makeup is often required, this film probably does more to change the actors' appearances than any other film I've ever seen. And I was going along with the ride the whole time.If you see one film from 2006, see ""The Departed"". But if you see two, ""The Prestige"" better be on your list."
"Review of The Prestige : I thought this was an amazing film. It takes a period before the advent of the illusionist pyrotechnics of modern times and shows us the magic. Not only does it have the magic working for it, it has a great story of revenge, hatred, one-upsmanship, genius, you name it. The story teaches us about illusion which is a much more accurate term for what we see. I will never look at David Copperfield the same way again. There is incredible scenic effluence. The acting is impeccable and the direction and cinematography is unrivaled. For once a film that lives up to its hype. Using David Bowie as Tesla is marvelous. I've always thought that he should have had a much greater career as an actor than he has realized. Michael Caine is the voice of reason, but his voice is seldom listened to. Revenge is one of the oldest motives and it poisons one of the characters. Stay with this one; then see it again. It is a masterpiece."
Review of The Prestige : This was the best movie I have seen in at least the past two years. Most movies have me leave the theater feeling like I wasted 8 dollars or so. So many movies lately have left me feeling like I wasted away precious hors of my life that could have been spent doing better things. Yet this movie was truly a masterpiece and kept me guessing the whole time. The acting was superb and so was the plot. I usually can predict the outcomes of movies pretty early on. And usually I can see the twist the writer planned. With this movie I was still left wondering into the last 5 minutes of the movie. I can't wait to own this on DVD.
"Review of The Prestige : Omg. possibly the greatest film ever made. the most genius story ever put to film. I keep saying it's hard for me to believe that it's even possible to come up with such a smart story. Amazing acting throughout. Intense throughout. Seems to get better with each viewing (5 viewings)
SPOILERS
after watching this for a 5th time, i still picked up on things that i don't think i noticed before, which is so impressive of this movie. the biggest one was that i could tell which brother was being portrayed by bale. the one that got married was nicer and calmer and more comforting. the one that sexes scarlett josexy is meaner, short-tempered and cockier. the fact that i could tell who was who, based on very subtle differences in his acting style, he's the GOAT for a reason. bale is a master of his craft."
"Review of The Prestige : The Prestige is about rivaling magicians trying to ""out-illusion"" each other with the ultimate magic trick. But really you are the one who feels like you are being tricked, this film has plot twists from start to finish and each one is even more shocking than the last. By the end you will want to rewatch it 100 times to follow along with all the tricks. It is the kind of film that you will not want to miss a single second of so you don't miss anything. The real magician of this film is Christopher Nolan, who created a deceptive story, a visually amazing film, and got an amazing cast to bring the illusion to life."
"Review of The Prestige : Brilliantly paced, wonderful actors and stunning storytelling."
Review of The Prestige : You don't need to know anything but Christopher Nolan made the movie and that's the bottom line!
"Review of The Prestige : This movie was truly a game-changer for me. I initially saw it simply because I enjoyed some members of the cast so much (Bale, Caine, Bowie), but I left the theatre in awe. It is such a well-written, layered, intense, character driven story on par with Faustus or Jekyll and Hyde in terms of characters that are overly driven by their obsessions. It invites you to watch in the first lines of dialogue and from that point forward, you hardly have a choice. One of Nolan's strengths is that he doesn't shy away from difficult stories to tell. None of the characters are entirely likable. It's hard to pick someone to root for, but that is one of the things that makes them so human. Jackman and Bale are both fine actors that attack their roles with tremendous capability and Rebecca Hall is one of the best discoveries I've had in movies. Even Johansson, who is easily the weakest link, was used sparingly and didn't detract from the movie. The plot is fascinating and leads to an immensely satisfying ending. I can't watch this enough times."
"Review of The Prestige : Every so often I see a film that I get addicted to. As soon as I watch it in the cinema I know I'm going to buy it the day it comes out on DVD.Well The Prestige is the latest of these. This film gets better and better with each viewing. Hugh Jackman should have won many awards for his role. People say ""Oscar"" but there are better awards out there than that, the Oscars are about as representative of what's the ""very best"" as the IMDb's Top 250 list is.People have told me that they predicted the end, well that's their funeral, I never clicked until it was revealed for me, so I got much more value for my money.Christopher Nolan is a master. Even though he seems quite humourless in his DVD extra interviews. He makes extremely entertaining films that are well cast and superbly executed, just as the Prestige is. All those who never liked the film should be rounded up in a field and used for crazed scientific experiments, we could use Tesla!"
"Review of The Prestige : ... but I guess that is really beside the point.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play two young British magicians - Alfred Borden and Robert Angier - trying to learn the tricks of the trade, somewhat even allied at first. Borden is a common Londoner, but Angier is to the manor born, using an alias in his magic work so as to not to embarrass his rich Victorian family. In the pursuit of a more fantastic trick a terrible accident occurs and Angier loses somebody close to him, vowing revenge against Borden, whom he holds responsible.These two are both the Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote to one another. Each one tries to sabotage and learn the other's tricks, make each other look
ridiculous, etc. Angier is the more dangerous of the two because he is truly intent on killing Borden when he infiltrates his ""catch the bullet"" act early on in the film and, instead, maims him. The rivalry ratchets up
to increasingly dangerous proportions. It is ultimately a fine piece of drama as to how far these two are willing to go in their obsession and for their art, with them both ultimately living tragic and miserable lives in the process. So much sacrifice for what most people would consider a trivial pastime. It is madness beyond obsession.This is a very entertaining and thought provoking film, and there is plenty of foreshadowing. Watch closely and watch it twice. I honestly don't think Christopher Nolan would be capable of linear storytelling if his life depended on it, but he is a master of this adapted material. At the end I could only go - ""Brilliant"".Scarlett Johannson plays Angier's lover who has a pivotal role in how the final act plays out. Rebecca Hall is Sarah, Borden's wife, who can't figure out why her husband seems to only love her on some days. David Bowie lends a real air of mystery to his portrayal of Nikola Tesla. But who else but Bowie could believably introduce his character by walking through lightning? Yes, the Tesla-Edison feud gets incorporated into the film and even a sci-fi angle is thrown into the plot. Michael Caine, as Jackman's magician mentor, seems to be playing his Alfred character from The Dark Knight. He has a supporting role, but watch him carefully, he has some of the most important lines of the film. And his final decision - do you think it was correct? Did two wrongs make a right in this unique situation?I wish I could tell you more, but I would give away the plot if I did. This is truly one of the better films made in the 21st century, and I largely don't like films made after 1960. Highly recommended and a real head scratcher, especially given the last line of the film."
"Review of The Prestige : I continue to be blown away at how fantastic this film is. It is executed with extreme precision. Every aspect of the film, all the way from visuals to the character development, is masterful.I'm not sure how it fared awards wise upon its release, but it should have racked up quite a few. The story is wonderfully layered, the acting is superb, the directed is spectacular, etc. I can't find anything about this film that I would change.Congratulations to the entire team that put this project together. I consider it one of the best films of all time.If you have the opportunity I strongly urge that you check this film out. I think you'll be glad you did."
"Review of The Prestige : In a modern age where most films are either: remakes, sequels, or prequels it is nice to be able to view a modern day original film. Yes, it is an adaptation, from a book, but many viewers will probably not know that until they actually begin to watch the movie, like this reviewer. Rolling Stone magazine (as printed on the DVD cover) said it best, ""You want to see it again the second it is over."" Christopher Nolan, who last directed one of the best comic book movie adaptations, in ""Batman Begins,"" does it again with ""The Prestige."" ""The Prestige"" is based on a book, of the same title, that was written by Christopher Priest. The story is about two magicians who have been rivals to each other ever since the day they met and throughout the course of time, each of them tries to gain an advantage over the other. Eventually the friendly rivalry becomes an obsession. Their obsessions over trying to discover how the other does the trick, or how to upstage that trick, could turn into something that would kill one another.First things first, this reviewer will not make any comparisons to the other magic movie, ""The Illusionist."" What this reviewer will talk about is the plot. The story is fantastic. You cannot help but stay alert, and throughout the film you want to know what will happen next. There are many twists and turns to the plot, which will make you say, ""How did I not catch that?"" There is a quote in the movie that is used frequently, ""Are you watching closely?"" You need to be paying close attention in order to catch all of the various twists throughout the film.Besides all of the various twists, the acting was also fantastic. Hugh Jackman was a big surprise success as Rupert Angier. Christian Bale is always good and the trend continued as Alfred Borden. Michael Cane as always was great as Cutter. Scarlett Johansson was also very good as Olivia Wenscombe. Even David Bowie and Andy Serkis popped up as Nikola Tesla and Alley.Overall, there is not much to complain about. If you are looking for a movie about magic with a hint of science fiction, you should enjoy this. If you enjoy Christopher Nolan films, you should see this movie. If you enjoy movies in general, you should see this film. It is a shame this movie did not win any academy awards. ""The Prestige"" is recommended!"
"Review of The Prestige : Magicians Alfred Borden and Robert Angier were once friends, but following an accidental death, the pair are determined to outshine, when ultimately destroy one another.It's a dizzying, dazzling, complex mystery, it may need a rewatch, as there's so much happening, it may be a little hard to keep up with all that's happening in front of you, but there's no denying, this is a captivating film.One of the best lineups imaginable, headliners Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both tremendous, two genuine legends, both at the top of their game. The supporting cast of Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie are all spot on.So many great and memorable moments, I think the scenes of Alfred and Robert upstaging one another were possibly the best bits of the film.The special effects are quite something, I'm watching this seventeen years in, and it still looks amazing. The make up department did a tremendous job here.Terrific visuals in general, great costumes and sets compliment the amazing location work.It remains a terrific movie.10/10."
"Review of The Prestige : This movie is beyond brilliant. I never payed that much attention to it the first two or three times I watched it on TV, but god, oh god, is it worth watching again! Every time! And now, when I finally sat down to watch it, I realized how much I had missed. I think it's one of the greatest movies ever created. Packed with subtle references, The Prestige itself is a magic trick and indeed, you have to watch closely. And when you do, you find yourself compelled by the seemingly harmless passion of the artist that is soon revealed to be a dangerous obsession which shows to what lengths a person is willing to go to and what sacrifices he's willing to make to be greater than his rivals and to be the very best he can."
"Review of The Prestige : If you think this film is mediocre or just a ""period piece"" then you have to think again because the true depth of this plot cannot be realized without watching repeatedly.I have watched it through several times and still can't tell if the Michael Caine character was the true mastermind.This screenplay could play in any time or place, even with unknown actors, and still generate eternal wonder.Too many directors rely on gratuitous violence, expensive action sequences, big name actors and grandiose sets/CGI to wow the viewers Christopher Nolan is an unmitigated genius and doesn't need any of those tricks."
"Review of The Prestige : I really don't know where to start. The great production design, the fabulous acting, the great cinematography, the superb writing, the awesome directing ... I really don't know. But I do know, that this is another Nolan movie. Which kinda is a trademark or became one for me. That is why the number one movie I was looking forward in 2010, was ""Inception"".But I will get into that other movie on its own page. If you haven't watched any Christopher Nolan movie yet ... well it's almost not possible. Even if you got away from all the buzz Memento created, it's almost impossible, that you haven't seen at least one of the Batman movies he made. Then again you might not be into that sort of movies. And that's the great thing about Nolan. Making entertaining movies, that have substance.Maybe Insomnia is his ""weakest"" movie (if you count the reception it got) and ""Following"" was just a student film, but even those two are a showcase of his talent. But then again, I might be just a fan-boy drooling about achievements that you think are not worthy mentioning. You have to make up your own mind ... start with this mind-boggling or with any other of his movies ... Repeated viewing is almost necessary! And you will most likely want to anyway!"
"Review of The Prestige : i'll keep this shorti loved it, i knew i it would be great simply from the cast and the director. i wasn't expecting it to be quite this dark but i loved every minute of it and was happy it was done this way. Nolen does a great job of setting up the ending of this movie to keep you guessing how it would be done. I guessed some of it but was surprised by other parts. I thought Andy Serkis and David Bowe were great. After seeing it at the late showing i had trouble sleeping b/c i was still trying to replay the movie in my mind to understand all the twists and turns.Great Movie, a must see"
"Review of The Prestige : An all star cast in this one keeping you guessing. Great story and great acting, never a dull moment."
"Review of The Prestige : I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to  my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year  so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they  would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh  Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in  a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a  little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film  and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the  way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for  some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as  soon as you can, you will not be disappointed."
"Review of The Prestige : Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.The final pay-off of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence, and preluding it is the pledge, followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in 'The Prestige's arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters: magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in turn-of-the-century London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fully-fledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death, and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the one-upmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. 'The turn' comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of love-interests, and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped, I scratched my head, I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.The prestige as the end note to the show  in which, for example, the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects, intertwines, intercuts, fast-forwards, rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of 'The Prestige' of all of its acts, in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie (and I agree), know that this is not a ""gotcha""-kind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film, rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap pay-off, but a tightly-written ever-shifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.Our two magicians are perfectly-cast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy, slick, ambition-driven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale's technique-driven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft, but lacks the 'Abracadabra' entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two, but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that, Borden has more layers to his complex, contradictory (keyword) persona than the flashy, greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role, shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However, the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions, and indeed they are given almost the exact same screen-time and voice-over narration throughout, a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan's.To further evaluate the cast of The Prestige, David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody, unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen (Match Point)  performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe, a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest, but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress, and resorts to boob-shots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director, for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps, as Michael Caine's character puts forward.With Scarlett as a pleasurable paint-job, twists by the bucket-load and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film, there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done, and superbly so, by Christopher Nolan. 'Antihero' gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friends-turned-rivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate 'prestige' of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder, bankruptcy, deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level, while Angier wants the public's recognition and wide-spread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same: create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.'The Prestige' is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch, as would underpinning some humour at one or two points (it is VERY gloomy), but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoe-in for my top 10 of 1006, and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years. I am eagerly anticipated director Christopher Nolan's next sleight-of-hand direction, and it looks like the closest is The Dark Knight (2008).9 out of 10"
"Review of The Prestige : Great movie and best movie I've seen directed by Christopher Nolan. The story of the movie was great and I did not expect the end. Most of the film's characters were excellent, and Tesla's appearance in the film was excellent. The acting was excellent, especially from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale who were dazzling in the film, the film embodies the period of the end of the nineteenth century, a great film."
"Review of The Prestige : Around the turn of the century, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo), and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are assistants to the magician Cutter (Michael Caine). Due to hubris, Julia is killed in one of the tricks. It sets off a combative obsessive competition between Angier and Borden that ends in their eventual destruction. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson play other love interests.This is a dense complicated plot. If you figured it out before the ending, then you're much smarter than me. Christopher Nolan and his brother have woven an intrigue story of obsession and revenge. The twists will leave you stunned. The reveals of the tricks are jaw dropping. It doesn't get more mind bending than this one.In a way, the flashforwards are not that necessary. It throws a complicated story into more confusion. It's too much. The movie may be better to be more straight forward. Personally, I like the challenge."
"Review of The Prestige : Long ago I watched The Prestige and The Illusionist in the same weekend. Comparisons are odious but it is inevitable for me to think of the second when talking about the first. You want to know why, keep reading.Magic is present in everybody's childhood, but it is something we lose, as we get older, in part because there are not many movies about magic to watch when you grow up. But if you want to turn the clock back and feel excited about how magicians perform tricks and get some answers about ""how it is possible"" or ""what's the trick"", lucky you because there are two movies which will definitely satisfy your curiosity.Both movies take place in England at the end of the XIX century. They not only have in common their genre, drama-mystery but also a fantastic cast. Edward Norton' remarkable portrayal of Eisenheim in The Illusionist is as memorable as Hugh Jackman and Christian Bales's in the Prestige. The appealing special effects, the convincing costumes and the compelling dialogue; you will enjoy these movies from the beginning to the end.Although there are several similarities between the two movies their plots are quite different. The Illusionist is, without a doubt, a much more romantic interpretation of the life of a magician. The Prestige, on the other hand portrays the rivalry between two magicians where revenge is the main feeling. The second movie is, indeed, more action-packed but no less moving than The Illusionist.These two must sees will trap you and will carry you to an enjoyable world full of magic. But if you really love cinema and good stories the one I highly recommended to you is the Illusionist."
"Review of The Prestige : The only thing I knew before watching this was; There are two magicians, and one of the best plot twists ever. While watching I was constantly invested in it, and enjoyed the whole ride. When I realised that Angeir was still alive, I thought ""Okay that was unexpected, but one of the greatest plot twists ever? Naah""Never the less at the time I thought that this movie was really incredible and I was happy that I watched it. But then, as I thought the biggest things were over, the plot twist is revealed and I was left in awe. My jaw quite literally dropped, and I sat there trying to comprehend what had happened. It was so amazing that I started chuckling in amazement. Cristopher Nolas never fails, he could post a video of paint drying and he would still manage to make it a masterpiece"
"Review of The Prestige : In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his beloved wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.""The Prestige"" is a great tale of rivalry, obsession, revenge and sacrifice. The unpredictable screenplay has many twists, disclosing unusual situations and hooking the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. Christopher Nolan, after the masterpiece ""Memento"", offers another excellent movie for the cinema lovers, better and better than the Oscar winner ""The Departed"". The amazing dispute between the outstanding Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman is supported by the extraordinary Michael Caine and a wonderful cinematography. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Grande Truque"" (""The Great Trick"")"
"Review of The Prestige : One of my most favourite films ever; 'The Prestige' is Christopher Nolan's most fascinating and engrossing film to date, pipping 'Memento' and 'Dark Knight', for me. The story of two rival magicians with a tragic history linking them, trying to outshine one another and the mysteries surrounding makes the premise of a magical two hour narrative.There ARE holes in this movie and the story is not as compact as some other Nolan films; having a few weak moments. But this is where the genius of Nolan comes in - he makes it work completely, despite those problems - which is why I rate this movie as one of his best directed films.This film doesn't have the heavy-handedness of 'Inception' (which is overrated IMO), isn't too clever for its own good (again, like 'Inception' and 'Memento' to an extend though I think the latter is Nolan's strongest in terms of sheer narrative brilliance)or the slightly impersonal feel of 'Insomnia' (a great film nonetheless; an underrated Nolan film I think). It is, in my opinion, the right mix of entertainment and quality. You will just not get bored with this film - in fact, I was left wanting more!The acting in the film is flawless and is what makes the film such a compelling watch. The entire cast is brilliant, without exception, from Rebecca Hall to Scarlett Johansson to Michael Caine. As the two rival protagonist magicians, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman seem to go one better that the other with each passing scene. Ultimately, it is Jackman who shines more as Robert Angier though. As the mentally distraught, obsessive but consummate showman, he pretty much steals the show from perhaps an actor who may, in retrospect, be superior in sheer acting quality.In a nutshell, 'The Prestige' is unlike any other Nolan movie. The sheer ""watchability"" value of 'The Prestige' beats the other Nolan movies blue and black. I have watched it four times completely; I enjoy it more and more each time. Without doubt, my favourite Nolan movie.Watch it; it is truly magical."
"Review of The Prestige : After watching the newest Nolan's film: The Dark Knight Rises, a real let down, I had to remind myself how good of a director Mr. Christopher Nolan is. I watched for the 4th time the Prestige.Contrary to Following and Memento, you do not know until the end that there is something more than what you see Until the end!. And then you watch it again and notice all the clues. It's one of these plots which seems so simple but as in magic tricks, nothing is what it seems.It's a great screen play of Christopher Priest's novel. The cast is incredible and Christian Bale needs to be congratulated for his versatility. Mr. Nolan did it again and the illusion is great. I was wondering how he could out do Following and Memento and he pulled one over my eyesagain. No, I won't tell you the plot because other people already did that and if I was to tell you more I would be spoiling the movie for you. Let's just say that I would have hated to have missed watching such a great movie. Please, enjoy it and know that you won't be disappointed. In fact, you will remember the Prestige for quite a while."
"Review of The Prestige : I've found this to be one of Nolans most entertaining and rewatchable movies. Two magicians start out as friends but develop a dangerous rivalry. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both phenomenal, amazing performances and a believable rivalry. The pacing is flawless, every scene and beat hits brilliantly and makes this a great and entertaining experience. The supporting cast all deliver, Nolan still can't write women, Bowie, Caine and Serkis pick up the slack easily. Whilst Nolan has become much more of a High concept director, often with stunning set pieces, with this he tells a basic story, with plenty of genuinely unexpected twists and stylish direction and cinematography. This shows the brilliant storytelling, which Nolan has mastered."
"Review of The Prestige : What sets Nolan and this film apart is the content of this film, not the acting (the only weakness being the Scarlett Johannsons accent, which is easily overlooked) and not even so much the story (which is also quite good). The story is okay, but what really took my breath away was the atmosphere (much like in Memento). He creates the perfect atmosphere for his movies, his style is brilliant. The shots are just gorgeous. In my opinion he is leading the charge in giving movie-goers a different experience; watching a Christopher Nolan film is a hugely different and a much more absorbing experience than nearly any other director. Well, for me anyway, obviously the experience is a hugely subjective thing.This film is special. There are no real good guys, no real bad guys, just human struggles with that hedging of the supernatural that really gets you thinking. His films are not perfect in that they don't fit molds or answer all the questions. That is what makes this film special, it draws you in and really makes you question things; important things.However, the important thing is that it is a truly absorbing experience, what more can you ask of a film?"
"Review of The Prestige : It doesn't rely on special effects at all so it does not age in the slightest. Just a unique story with excellent writing, professional directing, and wonderful acting from an all-star cast, which never gets old. This was a great movie when it came out 15 years ago, is a great movie now, and will be a great movie 30 years from now too. My only knock is that it requires some intentional ""suspension of disbelief"" in a few spots in order to make it work, but otherwise it's perfect. It is so good that it merits multiple viewings and I still look forward to watching it again. I put it in league with ""The Sixth Sense"" where the first time you watch it is superb but you have to watch it at least twice in order to really appreciate how good it is."
"Review of The Prestige : Now this was a movie that made you stop and think and then think again, and then go buy a ticket to watch again and think. Most of the people in the audience looked stupefied at the end of this flick. No greater tribute can be given for a movie based on magicians, magic, and science fiction. This is every magicians dream and to do it through the cinema is quite a trick in itself. The performances are excellent and Christian Bale as always is the character in life and breathe. Hugh Jackman is so turning out to be more than an eye catcher and can act in the most excellent and gentlemanly fashion. Michael Caine.......when don't you turn in an awesome performance. Scarlett Johanson does an excellent job and surrounded by such thundering performances, how can she not excel in the pouted way of hers and it is put most excellently to use in this movie. Take the rabbit out of the hat and take a bow, this was definitely a magic trick of a movie."
"Review of The Prestige : This film seems to have polarised IMDb posters like no other for a while.I don't know if it is a trick (sic) of time but the posts at the top of this list seem to love it and the posts at the bottom hate it. Is this due to having had time to think about it before commenting? In my case no. I came out of the theatre thinking what a good film, but by the morning, what a great film.The mere fact that it plays on the mind, and requires a lot of thought to see some of the holes (yes there are some but not as clearly dismissed as in some other films)gives an indication of the impact it had on me.I had to laugh at the comments over the accents and ""mumbling"". It's called English. It is not ""American English"". I don't criticise American actors for talking in American accents, so please don't do the same to my native tongue.My only advice here is go and see it for yourself if you have not already. Oh and look up a certain Nikola Tesla on Wikipedia if this name is not familiar to you.And finally, don't forget, it's a film. And fiction. It's not real, or historic. Enjoy it. I did."
"Review of The Prestige : FILM: 9/10.Christopher Nolan's 2006 film, The Prestige, is just as mind-bending and captivating as I remember it. From the very first scene, I found myself completely drawn into the intricate battle of wits between Christian Bale's Alfred Borden and Hugh Jackman's Robert Angier. The film's narrative structure, with its Nolan-trademarked non-linear storytelling, adds an extra layer of suspense and keeps you guessing until the very end.One of the highlights of this rewatch was David Bowie's portrayal of Nikola Tesla. Bowie's performance is nothing short of excellent, capturing the enigmatic nature of the legendary inventor. His presence on screen is magnetic, and every scene he's in becomes instantly more intriguing. It's a testament to Bowie's talent as an actor that he seamlessly fits into the already stellar cast.Another standout aspect of The Prestige is David Julyan's score. It's sparse, yet incredibly effective in building tension and enhancing the film's mysterious atmosphere. The haunting melodies perfectly complement the story, and the score's minimalistic approach allows the performances and plot to take center stage. It's a masterful work that lingers in your mind even after the credits roll.As I followed Borden and Angier's rivalry, I became engrossed in their obsession with magic and the lengths they are willing to go to outdo each other. The film delves deep into themes of sacrifice, loyalty, and the consequences of one's actions. Each twist and turn in the plot challenges you, and the final revelation still leaves me in awe. The Prestige is a testament to Christopher Nolan's storytelling prowess. His direction is flawless, and he effortlessly weaves together themes of obsession, sacrifice, and the nature of illusion.The Prestige is a cinematic gem that combines a compelling story, brilliant performances, and a touch of magic. Christopher Nolan's direction is impeccable, creating a visually stunning and thematically rich experience. This rewatch reminded me of why I fell in love with this film in the first place, and it has only deepened my appreciation for its intricacies. If you're a fan of mystery, suspense, and thought-provoking narratives, The Prestige is an absolute must-watch.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.5/10.Native 4K presentation, Detail level: Good, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: GoodAUDIO: 8.5/10.DTS HD-MA 5.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Good, LFE content: GoodMOOFIEMETER: 9/10."
"Review of The Prestige : Antici..................................pation! ( With apologies to the Rocky Horror etc,etc.)The Prestige is the third act in a magic show where the magic is presented. (The first two are called the pledge and the turn)The basic premise is of two magicians at the end of the 19th Century who become mortal enemies over a woman. And, as important, their rivalry in search of the greatest magic trick. And naturally the dilemma of what you can lose when you want to win, damn the consequences. The protagonists are superbly played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, ably supported by Michael Caine and assisted by Scarlet (why her, again?) Johannssen.Bale who was the boy in the exquisite EMPIRE OF THE SUN (9/10) and, of course, the not so personable anti-hero in American PSYCHO (8/10) as well as the latest Batman incarnation, is growing into his roles. He is on the cusp of A list status and thoroughly deserves it. This film is like an exotic buffet; exquisitely crafted, beautifully presented with oddities and interests available throughout. Moody and electric, it captures the time and era beautifully. It is another feather in the amazing Christopher (MEMENTO (9/10) Nolan's cap. He's become a name director that you can trust with your hard-earned moolah.Especially interesting in reality was the whole story of the Edison/Tesla feud which was only touched on here. Tesla was basically the person who invented AC current and then was shafted by Edison. Watch for an interesting cameo appearance here. And Andy (gollum) Serkis in a non-digitized role.THE PRESTIGE was really magic."
"Review of The Prestige : Maybe I'm still bitter, because I was hoping to see a dark tale about evil magicians and, possibly, some wizardry. Instead, what I got was an overdrawn, dragged out costume flick that gave away all of its suspense way too early. Anybody, who can't figure this film out within a half hour needs to get off the Xanax and stop daydreaming. I knew from the start that there was no way that Batman killed Wolverine, at least not the way he was being accused. Like the movie repeatedly asks ""are you watching?"", all the answers are given quite early. When Borden's wife makes the assertion that some days he loves her and others he doesn't, that alone tells you there is another. I know I'll probably be ripped to shreds for my opinion on this film, but it's mine and I'll stick to it. And for god's sake what was Scarlett Johansson even doing here. Don't get me wrong, I love Scarlett, she's a great talent, but every scene she was in dragged, she looked like she would rather be somewhere else the whole time. I assume she and Jessica Biel have both sworn off magicians for life. The one thing I really enjoyed in this film? David Bowie. The man still has a presence that musicians and actors of today would kill for. One last thing? Was Edison really such an evil bastard that he would destroy any competition that came? I'll have to look into it."
"Review of The Prestige : ""The Prestige"" is the kind of movie you wish will come after sitting through 25 other bad movies. Simply put, this is the best drama I've seen all year. Set in the late 1800's in (mostly) London, the film is about two rival magicians who continually ""one up"" another on magic acts. The film stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine. Caine plays the mentor of both magicians. The movie is shot out of order and sort of begins with the end. But just when you think you know how the movie really ends, it throws you for a huge twist. I won't divulge into the plot because if I do I'll spoil a lot of it. Let me just say this: I've seen so many movies that very, very few of them are able to surprise me at the end. This is one of those few movies. I was caught completely off guard with the final twist.In the first hour of the film I quickly realized that this movie is NOT the movie you've seen advertised in theaters and on TV. The trailer makes Bale out to have real magical powers and Jackman out to be the copycat magician. As it turns out, neither is true. (That is NOT a spoiler). This is quickly realized within the first 30 minutes of the movie. The trailer's deception left a sour taste in my mouth, but by the end of the movie you soon figure out why the film's trailer was so deceptive; it's all part of the magic. I can only surmise the trailer was so deceptive because they simply didn't want to give away juicy plot details and spoilers. And I'm glad for it! Normally I despise a film when it's misrepresented in a trailer, but by the end of the movie I had forgotten all about the stupid trailer.The performances were all very, very strong. However, it's Christian Bale that shines in this film. This is probably his strongest performance yet. (The 2nd strongest being his manic role in ""The Machinist."") That's right folks, he was nothing in Batman Begins compared to this movie. Anyways, don't be surprised if he gets some sort of nod from the Academy or the Globes for his role in this.This is the movie that ""The Illusionist"" tried to be. If you were left disappointed with ""The Illusionist"" (as I was), you owe it to yourself to see this magic movie. You'll be happy you did."
"Review of The Prestige : When The Illusionist ended, it felt like there just wasn't enough of the theme. Just how perfect was this movie? Period piece, great cinematography, great editing, colors, contrasts, actors, script, plot, revelation and it was all about a turn of the century magician. Here's an era that hasn't been explored much in Cinema. It got a 5 outta 5 from this reviewer.The Prestige gathers Batman Begins' two stars, Christian Bale and Michael Caine and thankfully forgot to include the dreadful Katie Holmes. So with the perfect trifecta of players known to work well together, Nolan adds another player, Hugh Jackman, aka The Wolverine. But the superb actor roster does not end here. Andy Serkis of Gollum fame plays the eccentric assistant to the even more eccentric real-world historical figure, Tesla, played by the best actor to play such freaks, and a true Rock God, David Bowie, who is barely recognizable in the his first scenes. And of course the feminine presence is filled by current Thinking Man's Goddess, Scarlett Johansson as the lovely assistant to our dueling magicians. You see the story isn't plain, it's quite complicated.Two aspiring magicians, are hired as crowd plants for the star magician's tricks that involve the use of spectators. Here's the setup. We have an aging magician touring around Europe and his trustee engineer Cutter, or ingénieur, as he tells the court, played by Michael Caine, brilliantly of course. There's of course the lovely assistant who happens to be the wife of crowd plant, Robert Angier (Jackman). During the preparation for the water tank escape, it is Angier's job to tie her legs and Alfred Borden's (Bale) responsibility to tie her hands. On one fateful evening, even after being told not to use certain not, Borden does so. The assistant unable to escape drowns in the tank. This drives a rift between Angier and Borden and in sue turns them into rivals; a vindictive rivalry that goes beyond the ends of science, physics and ethics.At first we see the sides of both magicians trying to pick up the remains after the tragedy. But always watchful of each other they will endlessly pursue the crippling of the other's life and career as magicians. Whether it's ruining the act or even using real ammunition during a bullet catching trick. There's nothing one won't do to one-up his adversary. When Borden comes up with The Transported Man, a trick where he seemingly enters a placard and comes out another one on the stage, within the time it takes for a ball to bounce; Angier is haunted with this astonishing trick which he can't seem to reproduce without using an actor as a double. This very trick begins the downward spiral into madness both men will experience. Angier's interpretation of the act is exposed by a disguised Borden. The event leaves a humiliated Angier with a very broken leg and with an empty theater.This leads him to sequester Borden's assistant for ransom. The demanded ransom is the key word to decrypt Borden's stolen magic trick book. This key, which is of course trickery, leads Angier to Colorado Springs to meet the eccentric Tesla facing hostilities from his own personal rival, Thomas Edison. This is where we learn about obsession and how it drives men like Tesla and Angier. Tesla believes he has created a teleportation device. But it has a few bugs that need working out. But Angier' is too eager to spend his fortune acquiring this device to bring his career back to greatness and finally defeat his nemesis, Borden.For those who don't know about Tesla, he is considered to have invented the 20th century. He created wireless communication in 1893 and Alternative Current (AC) and was the object of utmost frustration and competition to the better known Edison. Tesla was considered mad by some for theories about science-fiction worthy concepts, like a global wireless telecommunications network. Yeah he sure was wacky huh? Now I won't say much more about The Prestige's story line simply because it would ruin the fun. But be assured that this movie is great and parallels the brilliance that was The Illusionist but with the slight difference, that The Transported Man isn't a trick. And there are many, many twists in the storyline that may or may not be expected but only add to the complexity and richness of the story.Every little detail in the environment is taken care of as much as possible to transport the viewer into this magical world. Nothing is spared to make the storytelling as real and believable as possible, even in its most fantastical moments. Every major actor in this movie gives Oscar worthy performances. Not just one of them, but all of them. Nolan cannot go unnoticed this year for the best movie statuette, best writing, and best direction.If someone can reinvent intelligent cinema, it's a man like Nolan. He's proved it time after time. Memento, Batman Begins and now The Prestige.I will end this review here, for fear of revealing too much of its secrets. It would be like taking off the icing and leaving you with the cake. This movie must be seen by anyone who loves cinema that isn't packed with Hollywoodisms, clichés, gratuitous fireballs and puerile sexiness. If you haven't figured it out yet, The Prestige gets 5 abracadabras outta 5."
"Review of The Prestige : When Christopher Nolan decided not to make the follow up to Batman Begins in order to concentrate on this, my reaction could be gauged as somewhere between disappointment and pathetic, howling cries of grief and anguish as I wept fanboy tears of despair. However, upon seeing it, I am definitely glad he did because The Prestige is one of the most enjoyable films from 2006 I've seen: a twisty turny epic about two rival magicians in Victorian era London trying to out do each other with more twists than a contortionists convention.The story revolves around two men: Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), former friends turned bitter enemies after a tragic accident during one of their shows. Angier is the showman of the two, a good magician blessed with the fact he's got natural charisma practically gushing out of his ears. Borden on the other hand is a man brimming over with skill and invention, but has a rather dull personality compared to his rival. Constantly trying to outdo one another, Angier discovers that Borden has invented a new illusion called The Transported Man and becomes obsessed with discovering his secrets. Unable to do so, he creates his own version and sets in motion a spiralling chain of events that can only lead to the destruction of them both...From out of this premise, Nolan creates an engrossing and highly enjoyable film. Jackman and Bale quite rightly burn up the screen, with Bale in particular going a long way towards justifying his reputation as one of the finest actors of his generation. There's a very strong emphasis on the spectacle of the magic industry as well, so to watch the two men performing their tricks is a riveting experience, not least of all when Angier perfects his version of the Transported Man and winds up travelling to the other side of a vast theatre in the space of two seconds. As with all magic, half the fun is trying to figure out how they do it, the other half is not knowing.Unlike real life magic shows however, it's not all fun and games because for all it's showboating, The Prestige is still a very dark movie. Angry young men have always been strongly characterised in Nolan's movies and Angier and Borden are no exceptions. They are both sympathetic, realistic and detestable in equal measure, each man getting multi faceted characterisations to the extent that it's difficult to know which one to root for. The only downside of this is that the rest of the cast, with the exception of Michael Caine's venerable old master, don't get such loving time devoted to them. Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife Sarah in particular is a very sad character, worthy of a lot more screen time given Hall's fantastic performance.Thankfully though, this is the only real complaint about the entire movie and isn't quite so noticeable on the first viewing when you get swept up in the duo's battle of wits amidst the fantastically recreated Victorian London. This confirms Nolan's reputation as one of the most talented storytellers in Hollywood today and is another glowing addition to his already impressive resume. And if the attraction of two men locked in a complex and vicious cycle of revenge isn't enough to justify a viewing...well, it also has Scarlet Johansson waltzing around in a skimpy corset. Try and resist it now."
"Review of The Prestige : Certainly one of the darker, yet more interesting films of the year, The Prestige sets out to tell a story full or originality and intrigue. Magic is a hard subject to resist. There is a part within all of us that has an avid curiosity and need to know how to explain the unexplainable. Of course, once it's revealed, almost all interest is lost, and it seems it's time to move onto the next thing. The Prestige tells a lot. I won't venture too far for fear of giving too much away, but while much is revealed in this film, there is still a lot to scratch your head over as the final credits roll (to a magnificent Thom Yorke song I might add). Yes, The Prestige has all the elements that keep your head spinning. Is it good? Yes. Will it stay with you? Yes. I'm just not sure I want that much darkness to follow me home.The Prestige, (like The Illusionist also released this year) is another thriller about 19th-century stage magicians with secrets which advances so far beyond its recent predecessor that only the subject matter entices me to mention them in the same sentence. Credit lies with director Christopher Nolan, who approaches his projects with a dark vision that I find wholly appealing. He wanders through the shadows of human desire and ambition, coloring his observations with sarcastic wit that staves off the despair to which they might otherwise succumb. Showbiz illusion makes a natural fit for Nolan. He understands as few others how much film has in common with it -- and Christopher Priest's source novel sets a story uniquely suited to his sensibilities. It centers on the bitter antagonism between two rival performers, once friends apprenticed under the same man, but now poisoned by jealousy and reproach. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a master of technique, grasping sleight-of-hand mechanics with unparalleled insight. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is less physically adept, but makes up for it with supremely charismatic stage presence. This is something that his counterpart never quite got the hang of. Both have good reason to despise one another. Borden's arrogance once triggered an accident that cost Angier dearly, leading to an act of vengeance that threatened to cripple Borden's performing abilities for good. The two survived and went on to successful careers, but the seeds of hate were planted deep, and now the good things in their lives mean nothing when compared to the prospect of destroying each other.The interesting and visually brilliant technique that Nolan uses in keeping your interest in by enticing you with his abstract, and sharp color, as well as reminding you that if you look away, you might miss something--and certainly you might. As the film trails on, you are left to develop theories and ideas, knowing full well that your guess is as good as the person sitting next to you. There are jump cuts, quick edits, and long meditative shots on such beautiful starlets as Scarlett Johansson. This may be Nolan's technique for distraction as the background may very well be giving you the big reveal. The plot grows intensely complicated (the posters aren't kidding when they admonish you to watch closely) and sometimes strains credibility (fake beards come into play a little too often), but faithful viewers will be richly rewarded by the clever ingenuity on display.Nolan keeps it all together with the same tricks that have made his previous films so enjoyable: clever story development and focus upon character. Like Memento, The Prestige utilizes a complex editing style, cutting back and forth between eras to create a cinematic texture of misdirection and revelation (high regards should also go to editor Lee Smith for an extraordinary job). The results draw us close to the central figures, then let us watch in rapt fascination as their wounds and desires drag them down. A few problems and inconsistencies do arise -- places where plausibility strains or the twists become repetitive -- but like the characters on-screen, Nolan is so good at guiding our attention elsewhere that we soon forget such problems. His leading men give him plenty of help. Bale's knack for evoking the dark side is well established, but it's sublime watching Jackman turn his immense charm towards sinister ends (this is easily his best film performance to date). Both make excellent use not only of their characters' strengths, but also their fears and insecurities, which retain an ounce of humanity even as they seek new parts of their souls to sell.There is a lot to here to be creeped out by, especially when the end comes around. The darkness became so overwhelming to me that I had a hard time shaking it soon after. It made me fearful again of what humans are capable of and reminded me that there is still much to be learned about the dark side of the human psyche. The Prestige does earn high praise not just as a terrific historical thriller, but also because it grasps the medium's links to this subject so remarkably well -- just like Welles, Hitchcock, Wilder and all those other great filmic magicians whose ranks Nolan is well on his way to joining."
"Review of The Prestige : When Christopher Nolan made his debut into American cinemas with Memento, film-lovers witnessed the first rumblings of a creative genius who brought innovation and artistic flair to theaters with his unique visual and narrative style. Since that time, I've eagerly awaited each of his subsequent films with the hope that his unique cinematic style would continue to develop. I haven't been disappointed. In 2005, Mr. Nolan directed what many fans believe to be, arguably, the best of the Batman films, finding both critical and box-office success. As a surprise to those expecting a sequel to Batman Begins, Mr. Nolan has instead produced a subtly staggering film about personal and professional rivalry between two magicians. The Prestige finds Mr. Nolan again in top form and re-teaming with his Batman Begins star, Christian Bale.The Prestige is an extremely complex film surrounding the conflict, jealousy and vengefulness that haunts two rival magicians. The story is told in a skewed timeline not unlike Memento. If anything, The Prestige's timeline is more intricate as the story shifts between several viewpoints and jumps around in time throughout the film. While this might sound confusing, this complex narrative never loses the viewer's attention or makes the movie less enjoyable. The multi-faceted approach instead pulled me in completely. It is one of my favorite films. As far as plot is concerned, I think it is best to omit most of The Prestige's details from this review as it relies heavily on numerous plot twists and surprises. I'd hate to ruin that for anyone. Suffice it to say, I found the subplot involving famed inventor Nikola Tesla to be a story-telling masterstroke. For those of you familiar with the inventions of Tesla, his involvement in the plot will be a definite highlight. It's also worthwhile to note that The Prestige has incredible replay value. This is a film that demands repeat viewings and delivers more surprises and depth with each look."
"Review of The Prestige : I'd never even heard of this movie when it was shown on TV and only decided to give it a watch after I read that Michael Caine and David Bowie were in the cast.I was immediately caught up in the story line, which is almost totally believable, considering the function of the Tesla machine this is no mean feat of writing and acting. It was totally engaging from start to finish.The scene where a young boy starts crying because he believes a canary has been killed is a massive clue to the whole mystery, which is revealed right at the end. This is one movie that I am looking forward to seeing again, it's not often one says that."
"Review of The Prestige : I'm going to be specific. For God's shake, this movie captivated my attention since the very first image, the very first line. Every scene, every second of this wonderful movie is a stoned masterpiece that no one ever will top. The prove that this is the most stunning mind- blowing epic movie ever made is that after watching it for first, or second or third time (whatever), you try to understand the puzzle for a week. I seriously want to cry, because of this film, I will never watch something better. Thank you, Nolan. Long live the king."
"Review of The Prestige : This is one of my favourite films.
It is full of twists and turns and ends in an unexpected way.
No matter how many times i watch the prestige i pick up on something new hidden within the story.This is an amazing film that will get you thinking and wondering about how it is done."
"Review of The Prestige : What ""The Prestige"" does very well is recreate a period of show business history near the turn of the century in which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain. Much of the film rings very true, such as the all-consuming obsessions of the lead characters to be the best and outdo all others. It's an easy step to accept that such unwavering determination spills over into deadly territory, as rival magicians suave Rupert Angier (a riveting performance by Hugh Jackman) and audacious Alfred Borden (Christian Bale effortlessly playing a brooding lower-class Brit) each seek to wreak continuing revenge upon the other.The story, though adapted from a novel, feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities, as the machinations of the two men become increasingly convoluted during a back-and-forth tug of wits that keeps you guessing in the style of Nolan's ""Memento."" As the game grows increasingly deadly, and threatens to consume all they love, the film becomes a fascinating study in single-mindedness.The work is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted. The only odd note in casting is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla (he looks nothing like the actual Tesla, if you care about these sort of things, and his appearance calls attention to itself as superstar casting often does), but Mr. Bowie holds his own. Solid performances are all around, with Michael Caine adding dignity and depth as the old master, Scarlett Johanssen as the as the lovely stage assistant who becomes the third point in a twisted love triangle, and even Andy Serkis (Gollum!) in a memorable supporting role.The introduction of Tesla adds yet another twist, as the film shifts from real-but-possible stage illusion to steam-punkish sci-fi. This transition is a hard note to pull off, since the beginning of the film doesn't quite suggest such a direction, but if you're willing to let Nolan lead you on the journey into increasingly fantastic realms, the narrative rewards you with thought-provoking moral and dramatic exploration of the issues raised.A truly entertaining movie, and an original, unusual, dark ride -- well worth seeing in a theater for its grand scope and vision."
"Review of The Prestige : The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography, from script to presentation, Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world's brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.Told in a narrative that jumps between various points along its time line, playing out like a magic act itself, the story is that of two magicians on the rise in their careers. The first -- played by Christian Bale -- is an expert in understanding the fundamentals of any trick, but lacks showmanship. The second -- played by Hugh Jackman -- is a master showman who is more entertaining than technical. A tragic series of events pits the two performers against each other in a battle of wits that spirals further and further out of control, consuming both of them and everything and everyone they care about.With a story that requires actors with a great deal of emotive range, Nolan has assembled what could be described as a dream cast. Both Bale and Jackman suit their respective roles perfectly, and pitting these two performers against each other was a stroke of casting genius. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role by any lesser actor and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist Nikola Tesla absolutely shines. Add Andy Serkis to the mix, and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.The Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery, drama, suspense and fantasy. In that, the story becomes a never-ending stream of wonder for the mind: one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next, becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters, each adding their own viewpoint to the events, and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract, the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.The only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla's introduction (winter suddenly becomes spring/summer and back again) and a strange choice of music for the closing credits (a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky). However, neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.In the end, the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across."
Review of The Prestige : The final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances. I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist - very unique.
"Review of The Prestige : In the filmmakers' minds. Instead, it became one of the finest films of the year 2006. ""The Prestige"" is a perfect example of what a movie should be like if it does not rely on you liking and cheering for the central characters. Neither Angier (Jackman), nor Borden (Bale) are likable characters at all. And yet you are completely under their spell as this film goes on. This may be a bit of a subjective take as I quite like Hugh Jackman and find Bale a joy to watch most of the time as well. And Johansson and Hall are among my favorite actresses as well. But it's not only the cast that makes it so much worth watching. It's also the visual side. Art direction, set decoration, cinematography and costumes are top-notch and even the rare special effects are pretty nice. The film managed two Academy Award nominations for its visual side, both of them very deserved and I actually would not have minded if it had won one of these over ""Pan's Labyrinth"".The film's director is Christopher Nolan and he also wrote the movie together with his brother after the first Batman film. He also cast some of the actors from his superhero trilogy, including Bale and Caine, the only one who didn't do that much for me. Now back to Nolan's script: I think this is probably the heart and soul of the film. Such love to detail, so much suspense, so many surprises and all these great scenes like the doppelgänger parts or the suicide of Hall's character in the room with all the birds, which were actually the way how he met her when he talked to her nephew. Very very smart screenplay. All in all, the best thing about it, however, is how he wrote the two protagonists and their egos constantly clashing with each other, maybe because they weren't so different after all. Of course, Jackman and Bale give great performances too and that is why it worked so well, but still you cannot appreciate Nolan's effort enough. And his brother's. Lets not forget about him. People say, Nolan has problems when it comes to directing and writing realistic female characters, but I disagree. He managed in this film without a doubt and he also managed in others. When the two magicians fight each other or I should probably say get their hands dirty, literally everybody else in this film is constantly affected: their women, their assistants, their set creators...The accidental death of one character's wife sets off a deadly spiral which results in murder in the end. Or does it really? Nothing in this film is what it seems and we do not only get one major plot twist in the end, but two. Apart from that, the progress in terms of inventions and electricity also brings a completely new dimension of progress for the profession of a magician, actually for life in general, for everybody. So, we also get some interesting references on Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. I also liked how Nolan revealed some tricks, but not all of them, so the movie itself stays a bit of a mystery still. This was the second time I watched this film and it was as good as the first. I highly recommend watching the almost 10-year-old, 120 minute-long ""The Prestige"". It's possibly my favorite Christopher Nolan movie."
"Review of The Prestige : In between the Batman movies, Christopher Nolan cast Christian Bale and Michael Caine in ""The Prestige"". It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Initially partners, they had a falling out and became rivals. From there the movie becomes a battle of wits, showing how the men have no aim except to destroy the other. Caine plays John Cutter, the state engineer who works for Angier.I notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan's others. There's the non-linear plot, like ""Memento""; one-upmanship, like ""Insomnia""; the question of morality, like in ""The Dark Knight"". But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks, how the characters use the tricks against each other, and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier's and Borden's rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla's (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.All in all, I recommend this movie. It's both a look into the world of magic tricks, and also the dangers of obsession with revenge. Also starring Andy Serkis (Gollum in the LOTR movies) and Ricky Jay (a real-life magician).PS: other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are ""The Illusionist"" and ""Scoop"" (also starring Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson)."
"Review of The Prestige : This enjoyable and fresh story about intense rivalry among magicians is set in turn-of-the last century, London.Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) his wife Julie McCullough(Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden(admirable Christian Bale) are friends and magician's assistants. Then Julie accidentally deceases during a sideshow , Robert accuses Alfred for her killing . A new assistant named Olivia(Scarlett Johansson) helps Robert and he falls in love with her, though later she fell in love with another man. The magicians use their powers to combat among them. Both become prestigious magicians and get mutual envy. Magician Robert sees the Borden's transportation show and he becomes obsessed with his magic trick. They battle each other for their magic tricks and Robert attempts disclose the secret about disappearance from his contender with fateful results.This splendid movie is stunning in many aspects and blends appropriately various genres: the lush romantic period piece during nineteenth century Victorian Era, mystery thriller and fantasy.The picture gets it all : suspense, mystery drama, star crossed lovers,plot twists, murders,tragedy and supernatural illusions . Featuring an excellent casting, as main actors, Jackman, Bale, Johansson as eclectic secondaries, Caine,David Bowie,Andie Serkis and Rebecca Hall.Luxurious attention to period detail in brilliant costumes and spectacular production design . Beautifully and mesmerizing cinematography by Wally Pfister. Intriguing and evocative musical score by David Julyan. The motion picture is perfectly directed by innovator director Christopher Nolan, author of various masterpieces: ¨ Insomnia,Memento,Batman begins, Dark night¨. At the same time was made another film(2006)with similar theme titled 'The illusionist'by Neal Burger with Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti and Jessica Biel which also achieved much success. Rating : Above average, it was throughly amusing and exciting, and no as predictable as you would think. The film results to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work,it's highly recommended and keep you guessing until final."
"Review of The Prestige : The Prestige is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as two magicians that worked side by side until a tragic accident lead them to separate and now, they develop a deadly feud between them. This is a fantastic movie. One of Nolan's best yet again. Nolan is such an inspiration, he hasn't made a bad film, and I hope he doesn't. This guy knows how to make a film. The story was written by his brother, and Chris turned it into a film, just like ""Memento"". Christian Bale gives a great performance as Alfred Borden, a magician known as the Professor. Same goes for Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier. Very well depicted characters, each with a sole purpose. The writing in this film is excellent. Nolan brought the script to life with these nailbiting scenes. The death of Angier's wife was the point in which Alfred and Robert separated their friendship and became rivals. They then go on their separate performances and make new tricks. Some of the tricks would be sabotaged by the either Robert or Alfred, for instance, one scene where Alfred is displaying a trick with a gun, he has a volunteer. That volunteer is Angier, who takes the gun and slips in a real bullet then shoots off Alfred's fingers. That was where the violence started in their rivalry. The friction between Angier and Borden is very great. Hugh and Bale have great chemistry on screen together and I love how they got back at each other. The death of Borden's wife, Sarah, was unexpected for me. That was a mighty surprise where I was like WHAT?! Then, at the end, the plot twist was revealed, where Alfred actually had a twin who was his double. His double was the one that was going to prison and he was actually the other man, I forgot his name, who then revealed himself to Angier at the end. It was a very good twist and I loved it. However, there is one thing I didn't like. During the time Angier went to see Tesla, played by David Bowie, there was always a shift in seasons, where it snowed and then it was green again, and it was confusing to get my head around it, but that is all. Overall: 9/10"
"Review of The Prestige : Oh man, this one had me right up to the part with the transporter/duplicator machine. Until then it was a compelling and complex tale dealing in murder, mystery and intrigue with a clever backdrop of magicians attempting to outdo each other with the grandest illusion of all time. What I'm not going to do is go back and watch this three times in a row like I did with ""Memento"" because when all is said and done, I won't be any better off. In a way I felt cheated that an 1880's era film would bring in a fictional sci-fi element the way it did. It seems to me the story could have gotten around that contrivance to come up with a more realistic resolution that confined itself to existing science and techniques of illusion. Then, when Borden (Christian Bale) had his final showdown with Angier (Hugh Jackman), he could have caught the bullet to end the picture on a more promising note. I don't really mean to sound so harsh on the film because like I said, up to the Tesla part this story was going great guns. Maybe because the guy portraying Tesla looked so much like David Bowie, it kept me off stride for a while as well. Then it turned out to be Bowie when the credits rolled, and I was back to thinking about that business with the cats and the hats. Maybe the whole thing was an illusion."
"Review of The Prestige : Well, I have managed to get around to watching this film, which I believe is the last of the Christopher Nolan films that I have to watch, and sure enough, it is as impressive as pretty much all of his other films. While on one hand it just seems to be a film about a couple of stage magicians who are bitter rivals, there is actually much more going on, and of course the time line doesn't move in a linear way either, which is something that Nolan definitely seems to like doing in this films.It opens with a court case, where one of the magicians is on trail for murder. The idea is that one of the cases, namely a case that is full of water, and there is a catch on the case that allows it to be opened from the inside. However, it locked, which meant that the magician that was in the case of water ended up drowning. It seems to be pretty clear cut, but it turns out that there is much, much, more going on. In fact, the film jumps between what is happening during the court case and afterwards, and the events that lead up to the court case.The concept of the prestige is that there are three stages to a magician performing his act, and the prestige is the one that is left for the end which completely astounds the audience. Of course, such acts involve a lot of slight of hand, and of course there is this idea that a magician never reveals his secrets. However, rival magicians are always trying to find out what is going on in the background, so that they can mimic the trick. The situation here is one of the magicians is much more of a showman than the other, however the other magician has a much more impressive trick which he is trying to replicate.The interesting thing is that we have Nicola Tesla in the film, who is commissioned to build a machine that will allow the trick to be performed (and I don't want to give too much away considering that it is all a part of the suspense). As such, there is some science-fantasy elements in this film as well, so it is more than just a lot of slights of hand. Well, there is that as well, because as the film progresses, and of course reaches the end, which you could consider to be Nolan's prestige, everything is revealed, and it is definitely quite shocking.Another thing are the actors that appear in this film. We have Michael Caine, who happens to be a staple in pretty much all of Nolan's films, but there is Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and surprisingly David Bowie as Nicole Tesla. Apparently it was some effort getting Bowie into the film, namely because Bowie tends to pick and chose the roles that he plays, but when he does appear in a film, it is absolutely outstanding, and this film is definitely no exception.This is definitely a film to watch, especially if you appreciate Nolan's work. Mind you, it did take me a bit to get around to watching it, but when I started watching it, it was really hard to tear myself away from the movie, but then again Nolan's films are definitely a lot like that as well."
"Review of The Prestige : This is a story without a winner. Because whether it is the absolute worship of success or the inability to give up on hatred, it is destined that this game will never die, the soul will never dissipate, until one party pays a fatal price.Fatal is never magic, fatal is always the darkness of the human heart who does everything to succeed.The setting of the film is in the Victorian era, which not only brings in exquisite and complex costumes, gorgeous and flashy stage backgrounds, and bizarre and psychedelic stories, but also creates an illusion of a distant distance - that is, the restlessness and loss of the human heart that only existed in that era, and now in civilized society, we are rational, restrained, sober, and disdainful.As the old magician said, ""People all hope to be deceived, even for a moment.On our path to success, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, we will not break our souls into pieces or make choices that are both beautiful and gloomy, right?People all hope to be deceived, even for a moment."
"Review of The Prestige : Before Christopher Nolan started making movies that were so ""clever"" that that replaced intrigue with unbelievability, he made movies that were actually entertaining, thrilling, and fun.The Prestige has an all-star cast and a story that really does keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Unlike his recent movies, that are more on style than substance, this ""smaller"" movie is an example of how to maintain a storyline without trying to outsmart the audience with cheap tricks like backward/forward armies and other such nonsense.Nolan needs to rewatch his own earlier movies and make note of the old adage, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Sometimes less plot complexity produces a far superior story."
"Review of The Prestige : Christopher Nolan finds Christian Bale and Michael Caine in another universe, Victorian England. Using his story once again in a non-linear way, the director intertwines the journeys of two illusionists, who are first friends, then fierce rivals, who seem ready to do anything to be the best, only to harm each other (or vice versa). Against the backdrop of revenge and ego-battle, this convoluted story fails to capture the audience immediately because the going back and forth in time and the use of each protagonist's notebooks unnecessarily complicate the exposition. Therefore, it is important to concentrate and arm yourself with a little patience to understand the characters, magnificently embodied by the Bale-Jackman duo and flawlessly supported by a first-class cast including Caine, Johansson, Hall, Serkis and Bowie. IT ?After the rhythm stabilizes and dramatic issues emerge more clearly, we feel like those we occasionally see (people or animals) stuck in cages or other water tanks: we look for explanations, solutions, exit doors. ""The Prestige"" then becomes as fascinating as a maze, with the mix of frustration and exhilaration felt in such a place where play and anxiety intertwine. We can say that the reactions and decisions of the two heroes are sometimes disproportionate, and the dramaturgy works and catches us, catching us in every attempt to escape. Nolan also plays the magician: manipulating us, trying to resist while the public basks in the fact of being manipulated, looking for where they will be fooled, looking for where the strings seem too big...However, it must be acknowledged that the story probably goes too far in some aspects, especially as it strays from the direction of ""real magic"" (and hence fantasy cinema) to follow a more or less realistic story that emphasizes danger, which is admirable. The necessary consensual suspension of disbelief: thus there is a risk that this agreement will be broken for some of the public during the film. Similarly, it's possible that one of the final revelations seems unlikely because it suggests that one of the two characters is unaware of an important fact about their old friend - of course, let's say no more!But despite these negatives, ""The Prestige"" works like a magic show: We know it's fake, we're aware of some of the trickery, but we get carried away anyway. Isn't this what we call cinema magic?"
"Review of The Prestige : If all you read are some of the other comments here, you might think  ""The Prestige"" is a cheat and a disappointment. And maybe if you are  watching it with a superficial mindset, it is. But if you really pay  attention, and delve into the many layers of story, you will see the  movie as so much better than that.  Two magicians rival to be the best, and this movie takes you through  many years of that rivalry, along with the resulting jealousy, anger,  betrayal, and ethic and moral dilemma. Oh, and did I mention death,  disfigurement, and deception? The performances are gripping, and the  production is stunning, creating a believable setting that draws you  into the story. I did experience some moments of confusion when the  time lines jumped into the past or present a bit abruptly. But in the  end, most questions will be answered. It's important to remember,  though, that the most compelling question is not what was real and what  was deception, but rather, how far do you allow yourself to go to prove  you're the best?"
"Review of The Prestige : Honestly, this film is one of the most complex characters out of all of Christopher Nolan's films. Really thought provoking. Full of twists. Great performances by Bale and Jackman."
"Review of The Prestige : The whole movie is a massive magic trick and it deserves a second viewing just to comprehend the whole thing, which seems to be a constant thing regarding Nolan's movies.The movie is about two magicians (Bale and Jackman) who compete with each other as to who has the best trick, escalating to insanely extreme situations. Bale's biggest trick for example was that he had a twin brother and they swapped places the whole time! The twins went as far as cutting one's finger to match his twin brother. This was pretty awesome, especially if you know that real life magicians have gone to similar lengths. James Randy for example used to carry a piece of paper in his pocket for years. That piece of paper had ""today's"" date on it, saying that ""today I will die"". If he had a fatal accident, would you believe that he predicted his own death or that he wrote a piece of paper each day for years?! Talking about devotion! The movie explores that devotion and the sacrifices someone must do to deceive others. But the greatest deception of the movie was fooling the audience itself! The movie is very realistic but the explanation about the cloning machine was not something I could accept, so I looked around to see what other people thought about the ending. In my research pretty much everyone was agreeing with the explanation given, that Tesla gave Jackman a cloning machine, and Jackman in his every act kills one of his clones (or dies himself). That's pretty awesome and the audience bought it. But it's a lie nobody really saw! Michael Cain gives the secret 10 minutes before the end. Earlier he told a story about a sailor but he reveals now that the story was a lie. This is a hint that Jackman's story was also a lie, and Bale and the audience bought it.Cain tells the audience in the end that you don't want to know what happened, you want to be fooled. So what happened? Over the course of the movie, many bad things happen. Bale kills Jackman's wife and Jackman shoots Bale's fingers. Bale takes Johansson to his side, manipulates Root (Jackman's double) and humiliates Jackman on stage while braking his leg. Jackman kidnaps and buries Bale's friend to blackmail him for his secret. The secret was planned and Bale sends Jackman to a wild goose chase to America. There, Tesla fools Jackman with some hats and some cats to get away with the money.Jackman returns the favor by giving a fake diary to the imprisoned Bale. Everything regarding Tesla's machine, is only known from Jackman's diary. And knowing that Bale lied in his diary, then surely Jackman lied in his as well.So to wrap this up. Jackman was obsessed to find Bale's secret and it was only revealed to him in his last breath. The Tesla story was a lie and the machine never worked (that would be completely unrealistic, even for Tesla), but Jackman used it in his favor. Jackman used and killed Root to frame Bale. Bale dies, but his twin brother takes revenge by shooting Jackman.Almost perfect score because it fooled almost everyone!"
"Review of The Prestige : Screenplay , story telling and characterisation . nolan at his best . twist after twist . must watch movie for movie lovers"
"Review of The Prestige : A historical story line which demands a lot of attention to detail and art. Selection of the best in the class cast. Fantasy with realistic touch with scientists as characters. Salute you .. director. you did it well. I have a different view point for a certain point. I believe to keep the essence of the story 'importance of keeping secrets', you could have taken another mystical point to conclude the story. Like the live characters do not able to find out the secrecy even at the climax. May be for a commercial success of the movie, after that point, you could have indicated some points to the audience. Anyway the villain character's reactions to his false beliefs could not be captured then. But I believe, a person who sacrificed friendship & love (and many others..I cannot be a spoiler here!) will not do this at certain point to prove something to person who is no longer important to him. once again.. I salute you sir... a brilliant topic and a good canvas."
"Review of The Prestige : I was stoked to see The Prestige from the moment it first began gaining buzz. Hugh Jackman. Christian Bale. Scarlett Johansson. Michael Caine. Christopher Nolan. It just had the marks for something great, and the trailers only continued to perpetuate this ideally amazing film. While the film does deliver in many instances, I cannot help but feel that it was anywhere near as good as I could have imagined. Whether I hyped it up far too much or not, is up to interpretation.It is the late 1800s, and magicians are the key theatrical acts in London. Rupert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are two up-and-comers who work together, and then instantly turn into rivals after a particularly devastating incident early in their careers. What follows is a tale of both men finding a means of one-upping each other at every turn, whether it be physically sabotaging the other person's act, using the sexy assistant Olivia (Johansson) to help get secret information, or gaining help from the even more secretive ""wizard"" Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, in a rare film appearance).The thing about the film is that you have to pay attention at all times. It has moments where the film feels speedy, and others where it feels downright slow. But no matter what, something integral is always happening. Despite it being told in a particularly bizarre narrative structure (the present flashbacking to the past flashbacking even further into the past, and then back again), the film follows the key three-part magic act sequence (which any trailer fan should probably already know about). The film suffers here because it does not really stay consistent with the direction it wants to go in, and becomes a bit confusing and inane as a result. It may be a bit of a struggle to grasp the structure at first, but slowly becomes more easily accessible. At times it works strongly, but in others, it just feels like it wants to toy with the audience and do nothing else. We know every little detail matters, but should the material not be a little more solidified than it is? A bit of extra padding and focus here could have helped greatly.Being a period piece, you can see the great care and devotion taken to ensure that the film looks like it is occurring at the turn of the twentieth century. It may be dark, but there is just enough light to shine through and make everything all the more colourful. The costumes are all lavishly gorgeous, as are the backdrops and set pieces. It feels distinctive and authentic, but not to the point of being overkill. The score is just about perfect, and the editing really helps to act as the drive of the film. The great British accents are all highly in tune with the rest of the feeling of the film as well, even from the American actors.Jackman and Bale are excellent in their respective roles. Right from the start, you can tell these two are steering towards destruction, and as their characters slowly move into becoming downright evil, it becomes even more of a pleasure for the audience to watch. They play off each other well in their scenes together, and their presences are downright smoldering. These young actors really show off their chops, and show off the deeper range that only a few select modern actors can even pray to be able to show. While I really enjoy Jackman as an actor, I cannot help but realize this is one of his deepest roles yet. He's very striking in the role, but at times you can see that this is one of his first real attempts at doing so. Bale on the other hand, can add this right next to his already brooding library of ranged works (his most astonishing being his turn in American Psycho), and looks like he is right at home with the material. I know they probably will not get recognition during the awards season, but I can only hope this is a taste of things to come from both of them.Caine is great as the wise manager character that he has perfected over the years, and Bowie's small performance is practically intoxicating. He does not play the character up too much, but he plays it with just the right amount of intensity demanded. He is complemented by Andy Serkis, who thankfully plays a real-life character and not one made totally out of CGI. It was something different to actually see him literally acting, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it be just as good, if not better, than his CGI-work. Although they only have so much they can do, the three main female characters, Johansson, Piper Perabo, and newcomer Rebecca Hall all perform excellently, and work well off their co-stars. I would have liked to have seen a bit more material being used by these three, but they really stand up well against their much more heavily used male co-stars.Inevitably, the comparison to this year's ""other magician"" film, Neil Burger's The Illusionist, must come up, and thankfully, it works at about the same level. They both have strong acting (although the female acting is far superior here), a good storyline, and beautiful sets. If anything, The Prestige feels like it wants to accomplish more than it can handle. Thankfully, it does not become too overbearing, but some of the confusion the film generates really does detract from it.Although not as good as Memento or Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan has added another strong film to his short resume, and continues to prove his worth in Hollywood. I can only hope that the audience does not get too overly distracted by the film's structure problems, and can truly appreciate this all-around great film.8/10."
"Review of The Prestige : I went to this movie not completely sure what to expect. I knew it was directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) and starred Christian Bale (Batman Begins, American Psycho), Hugh Jackman (X-Men 1, 2, and 3), and Michael Caine (Batman Begins). I knew it was about magicians. I knew it looked cool as hell. This movie blew away all expectations. The acting was first rate and the direction, par for Christopher Nolan, was superb. This movie will definitely exercise your mind with more twists and turns than all of M. Night's combined. The quest for fame and one-upping a rival becomes an obsession that makes for a riveting piece of entertainment. Only Christopher Nolan could undertake such a complicated storyline and deliver it so perfectly. Definitely worth the seven bucks and two hours spent."
"Review of The Prestige : There seems to be a strongly defined split in posters' opinions about this movie. On the one hand, there are those who didn't see the two big story twists coming and thought the film was the best of 2006. Then there are those who did see the twists coming and felt cheated, just like audience who booed Bale's Chinese ring magic early in the film. One poster went so far as to say that because THE SIXTH SENSE kept him guessing then all came together but he didn't like the way the ending of THE PRESTIGE had to be explained by the narration, then the latter film somehow failed.I fall into the ""Didn't see the twists coming"" category (whereas I knew Bruce Willis was a ghost pretty much straight away in SIXTH SENSE).I'm afraid I didn't figure out Christian Bale's secret until it was pointed out at the climax of the film, though I did have an inkling of how Hugh Jackman's Tesla machine worked (the clue was in the hats and cats)But none of this matters. The real value of a movie is not the same as the value of a magic trick. Even if the film is ABOUT magic tricks. A film doesn't fail only because you figure out the twist ending. The journey is every bit as important as the destination. (And then there's films that DON'T have twist endings at all - are they automatically bad?) I know how the special effects are done in STAR WARS - doesn't spoil my enjoyment of the film one jot!No - in my opinion THE PRESTIGE is an ingenious examination of the obsession magic generates in its adherents where the entire film is a metaphor for the nature of performance magic.And it has TWO great twist endings. Surely, that should satisfy anyone?"
"Review of The Prestige : After watching 3 of Christopher Nolan's shows, I really have a high expectation of this movie. In addition to the great director, the cast selection is superb as well. Well, thankfully I'm not disappointed by this movie.""The Prestige"" is filled with twists and turns. I think how you see the twists and turns will affect what you think of the movie eventually. Some people will be fascinated by them (like me), while others won't. Well, the story can be basically summarized to two themes, Deceit and Obsession. I thought Nolan chooses a great way to present the story. Though the back and forth narration may confused some people, I thought it really works well for the movie, teasing audience to figure out how the story really goes. I feel that the type of flashbacks here is different from those used in Nolan's ""Insomnia"" and ""Memento"", though they are effective for their respective movies.I watched the show with some book spoilers in mind. To those who had read the book, well, the story is rather different from the book. The ending especially. The movie does not mention about the descendants of the Magicians at all.Hugh Jackman's and Christian Bale's acting are amazing. One supporting actor which I think stands out is David Bowie's Nikola Tesla. His charisma really makes his character interesting.Like other Nolan's movies, this movie is visually stunning. You won't be disappointed by its cinematography.Despite being a great movie, I don't think that this movie will be one of the major contenders for Oscar. The genre doesn't really suit well with Oscar type of movies.Nevertheless, in my opinion, this movie is one of the best movies this year, and is definitely a must watch."
Review of The Prestige : I love nolan movies it just give you the different type of story for movies
"Review of The Prestige : As said in my review for his masterpiece 'Memento', Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'The Prestige' is not quite perfect, but is still very good and one of Nolan's better films. To me actually it was close to outstanding, which makes my issues with the denouement even more frustrating. And it is the denouement that's 'The Prestige's' biggest problem, being over-baked and with one twist too many, the second of which being a convoluted cop-out and like the other twists before the denouement didn't happen.Was also, to a lesser extent, expecting more from David Julyan's music score, having done such a great job with the score for 'Memento'. His score for 'The Prestige' works within the film and has a mystical and dread quality, but it is not one of those scores that is listenable or even re-listenable as music on its own, lacking the cleverness and mood and thematic complexities of his work for 'Memento' and being somewhat too simplistic to be entirely memorable.However, 'The Prestige' looks wonderful. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious, complete with gorgeously evocative Victorian period production and costume design. Once again, Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and while the film is long there is enough to keep one riveted.The story for 'The Prestige' is quite the fascinating tale, with an incredible period and darkly magical atmosphere and twists and turns peppered throughout but done in a way that the storytelling is coherent and taken with sincere seriousness while not coming across as emotionally cold.Fine acting all round, with a charmingly flamboyant Hugh Jackman and intensely charismatic Christian Bale perfectly cast and playing off against other wonderfully. Michael Caine brings class and dignity to his role, and seeing how he altered his voice and posture for it it was clear he was right in the zone. Rebecca Hall, Piper Perabo and Scarlett Johansson also do well, as does surprisingly David Bowie in an unlikely role. Andy Serkis is similarly memorable.Overall, imperfect film but also a fascinating one, flaws and all it is for me one of Nolan's better films. 8/10 Bethany Cox."
"Review of The Prestige : The Prestige is quality modern film-making at its very best. Christopher Nolan has proved himself to be a director to watch after his successful reinvention of the Batman series, and now this film; different in theme and tone to Batman, and for my money, much better! The brilliance of this film comes from many different areas - the acting performances and the professionalism of the film shown throughout go a long way towards ensuring that The Prestige is an excellent film, but really it is the story that makes this one stand out. The film is based on a novel by Christopher Priest and focuses on magicians in nineteenth century London. Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are magicians and friends working as assistants to another successful magician. Their friendship turns sour, however, when Alfred makes a mistake that leads to the death of Robert's girlfriend on stage. This leads to a fierce rivalry between the two magicians, and after each one sabotages the others' magic show; the rivalry takes a new turn as they battle to see who can carry out the greatest magic trick...The plot doesn't develop linearly, rather Christopher Nolan chops and changes the exact point in the story where the film is running from, and this works really well as everything always feels fresh and inventive and Christopher Nolan is clearly a director capable of handling this sort of feat. The Prestige features an all star cast, and all perform excellently. The male leads are obviously the main standout. Christian Bale has really proved what a great actor he can be over the past couple of years, and his performance here still works despite the fact that he sounds a lot like Grant Mitchell from Eastenders. Hugh Jackman is good also and he gets to show more of himself than he did in the X-Men films, while the likes of Michael Caine and David Bowie fill out the supporting cast. The cinematography on display is absolutely fantastic, and the film does an extremely good job of recreating nineteenth century London. The special effects are good also, and the scenes involving Tesla's machine are all standouts. It all boils down to a terrific and suitably mystifying conclusion and overall, I really recommend that everyone takes the time to see this film. The Prestige really is one of the best modern films I've seen in years."
"Review of The Prestige : There's not much that can be said about The Prestige that has not already been said in its positive reviews. Christopher Nolan makes yet another remarkable achievement after the groundbreaking Memento and the extraordinary Batman Begins. Once again, Nolan does not for a moment prioritize the ""Ooohs!"" and ""Ahhhs!"" before strong character development and plot. By the end, Nolan can use these powerful cinematic tools to create those audience reactions instead of fantastical elements. Nolan is not the only one, however, that makes this movie work as a whole. With his brother, Jonathan Nolan, at the hands of the screenplay, and Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as the leads, people reading this review are only getting the tip of the iceberg with understanding the quality of this movie. You will have to see this movie for yourself.For those who were disappointed by this year's earlier entry in the ""Magician Genre"", The Illusionist, then The Prestige is the movie for you. On terms of quality, the two movies are just about polar opposites. While Edward Norton portrays the most wooden performance I've ever seen from him, Christian Bale shines once more. While Norton and Biel couldn't develop chemistry to save their life, the chemistry is magic between Jackman and Johansson and Bale and Rebecca Hall. While Giamatti and some of the cinematography play as the saving grace of the otherwise disastrous Illusionist, there is really only the overlong ending as a weak spot for The Prestige.I would be really ashamed if Bale does not get some Oscar consideration for this year's upcoming awards season. There is not a scene he doesn't shine in, and time and time again, he proves to be one of the best young actors in Hollywood. It is still a toss up for me on which film is the best of the year. It's either this or The Departed, but you cannot go wrong with either. In the scheme of things, despite the minor flaw at the end, this movie gets a perfect 10, and I now await The Dark Knight even more eagerly. Summer 2008 cannot come soon enough. It takes three great movies for me to label a director a genius. Mr. Nolan, you have a fan."
"Review of The Prestige : This movie is very engaging and intriguing. You are presented with a complete mess of scenes which go back and forth through time and are needlessly confusing, yet the core story and the characters were compelling enough to keep me interested and paying attention. The cinematography, the sound, the acting, and the visual elements are all perfectly in place, and overall its very entertaining.My only concern is that the film prevents itself from achieving greatness by relying heavily on a very cheap, shallow plot element. It becomes science fiction, which is fine but a bit strange after spending so long convincing me the characters are real. This is something I find with all of Nolan's movies, that they present themselves as being mysterious and secretive but fall a little flat if you apply any brain power to them.Still, I think this movie is worth watching if you're looking for something a little suspenseful, a little creepy, and very entertaining. Maybe the movie's ultimate goal is the same as a magician's, as said in the movie: that one moment where the audience is in awe and disbelief."
"Review of The Prestige : There are many kinds of magic: wizardry à la 'Harry Potter', illusions or hallucinations, or entertaining shows: mediums, rabbits in top-hats, women sawed in half, bag-content guessing, magic cards etc. Speaking of cards, Christopher Nolan's ""Prestige"", made between two 'Batman' movies, lays its cards at the first voice-over monologue where we immediately recognize Michael Caine's smooth voice. It's about the third kind of magic and provides the three structural rules of an act: it starts with the Pledge: you show something normal then the Turn, you make it do something extraordinary... but there's an element of expectation and the higher your reputation goes, the more sophisticated the public. In fact, there's got to be something unpredictable, so it all comes down to the Prestige, the trick no one sees coming and will earn magicians applauses and guess what? prestige.Then, the least you can expect from the film is to follow these three rules even in the loosest possible way if it means wowing you with a spectacular surprise. And given that it's a Nolan film about the deadly art of illusion, much more opening with the killing of a magician, the imprisonment of his rival whom everything accuses, your twist-radar is set from the start, so not any twist will do. Whatever the prestige will be, if it's not venturing in the realm of feasibility, something will have been missed. We're dealing with magic after all, not fantasy, not sci-fi. I insist on the sci-fi element because the film opens with some electrical contraption that shakes its credibility from the start until a reassuring trap door shows and we can let a sight of relief go.French called electricity a Fairy so it all makes sense that magicians would use it as a device for generating illusion, just like rivals Edison and Tesla were perceived as wizards. After all, it's also established that magic is about what you see and what you don't and the use of lights and darkness is integral to the act. Still, I didn't like that machine. It felt incongruous and weird in a period drama and I was afraid Nolan would end up inserting some Batman-like device. And when he said in the ""making of"" video that he wanted to portray magic according to his personal vision of film-making, I thought ""no kidding?"", I'm pretty sure everyone got the parallel, especially when magical acts use special effects worthy of a Spielberg film. So Nolan gets a little carried away at the end while the first two acts of the movie had really gotten me involved, I mean the escalating rivalry between the two magicians Alfred Bowden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and their attempts to destroy one's act or find one's secret. What Nolan got right is that the rivalry mostly works as a foil to plunge us in the world of magic and know all the tricks. After all, that's the greatest thrill about magic, seeing how it works. For instance, the way a magician puts a dove in a cage and then flattens it to magically making the dove reappear under a handkerchief always made me scratch my head... but in this Dickensian universe where there's no pity for little children, why should there for innocent animals?The trigger of the rivalry also helps to understand how one of the most famous magic tricks, the ""escape from the tank water"" that made Houdini's reputation, is indirectly explained. Working as false audience members, Bowden and Angier are assigned to tie the magician's pretty assistant (Piper Perabo), one of them makes the kind of knot that doesn't leave any chance for the poor girl, who happens to be the other's wife. We gather that from then, it's personal. Another pivotal moment occurs when one conceives his masterpiece, an act that consists on getting in a door and coming out of another. He calls it ""The Transported Man"", for us, it looks like teleportation and it justifies why the rival is devoured by jealousy, although Caine's character can only see one explanation: there must be a double.At that point of the review, it's impossible to go further without spoiling the film. It's engaging enough to make you forget there's a twist but it's not spoiling the film to say that there's a twist, since it's the essence of magic. You've got to wow the audience with a surprise at the end. With the seemingly death of a character right at the start of the film, the battle to know everyone's tricks and the existence of a double, anyone could reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. But you know Nolan has more than a trick in his sleeve and that's both a blessing and a curse. Granted anticipations are to be toyed a little to be emotionally rewarded, all he had to do was working on the narrative structure to make what we know first a more effective reveal or a shock.Instead of that, Nolan relied on a far fetched revelation combined with an implementation that destroyed the whole atmosphere built throughout the film. From the start, we follow magicians who are dedicated to their passion, which is good, but the escalation toward sadism and some ends-justifying-the-means means made their whole approach to their art debatable, leaving no room for sympathy. In this cruel battle of wits, women are reduced to disposable pawns (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannsen would get more dimensional roles in a certain Woody Allen's movie). The first two acts, we can call them 'pledges' and 'turns' are great but then the film goes downhill. One thing for sure, I hated that Tesla Machine, and no offense to David Bowie, but Tesla was quite a handsome fellow whom I doubt spoke with such a heavy British accent. Nolan wanted his film-making to echo magic, but he let the reverse thing operate."
"Review of The Prestige : Christopher Nolan is an undeniably great filmmaker and every movie of his I've seen I'd give at least a 7......that doesn't mean everything he does should be on the IMDb top 250, let alone this high up! I feel like everybody rates Christopher Nolan's films a 10 simply because he directed them. It irritates me to see movies such as this and Interstellar so high up on this list when (although they're both fine movies) there are so many other (in my opinion) objectively better films that deserve those slots. I pretty much only wrote this to complain about the inflated scores on most of Nolan's films, but I'll talk briefly about the film. The acting was very good and the presentation was nice but nothing spectacular. There aren't many specifics for me to complain about besides the ending, which is why this review has a spoiler warning. The ending makes the film contradict itself. Basically it turns out Christian Bale was playing a pair of identical twin brothers the whole time. Hugh Jackman gets Christian Bale hanged, only to get shot by Bale's twin. His twin was the reason he was able to perform the teleporting man stunt so seamlessly. This goes against the whole philosophy Bale's character was preaching! Its stated multiple times that the reason Bale could perform the trick so seamlessly was because unlike Jackman, he supposedly wasn't using a doppelganger. But then at the end it turns out he WAS using a doppelganger the whole time! JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN IDENTICAL TWIN DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE THE SAME PERSON! YOU'RE TWO DISCRETE ENTITIES! YOUR CLAIM IS A LIE!In essence, the rest of the film is great but the stupid ending tarnishes the experience as a whole."
"Review of The Prestige : The first time I watched ""The Prestige"", I didn't think anything of it whatsoever. However, on reflection, I think it's a film to be taken with a pinch of salt, and not just when regarding the magic.This movie suffers from two main characters having the thickest plot armour imaginable - making all of their encounters feel inconsequential. This is a fairly severe oversight in an otherwise robust film that does provide intrigue, but still lacks on a fundamental level.Nolan is one to weave as complex a tale as he can, and here is no different. Starting with a dramatic but unexplained death, the story plots the rivalry between two pioneering magicians: one who prizes showmanship and theatrics, and the other who reveres the art above all else. I prefer Hugh Jackman's performance to Christian Bale's (not something I would normally say), but Bale's feels a bit too abrasive and cynical even for the character design.What lost me a bit was the whole Nikola Tesla arc, where Nolan tries bridging the gap between illusion and reality. It's all a bit clunky, and whilst I don't particularly see why David Bowie was brought in for the role, I don't see anyone else doing much more with the material either.The music is fairly minor in the story (not orchestrated by the usual Hans Zimmer), so doesn't elevate the film like in most of Nolan's other projects. Stylistically, there is a faithfulness to 19th century London; period attire is par for the course, but there is a decent finesse to the whole endeavour. The scenes in the USA are the best looking parts, as the scenery across the pond gives a little more scope for artistic license.Mercifully, Nolan does leave most of the chronology alone, allowing a more rigid story to be told. Towards the end, I did begin to feel a greater sense of attachment - the conflict between the protagonists is palpable - but the romance aspects felt contrived and just like plot padding. I was invested in the finale, and there certainly are dramatic twists and turns, but in my opinion, they require you to accept some flawed storytelling tactics.""The Prestige"" is definitely not one of Nolan's best: whilst it does exhibit shades of what makes his masterpieces so powerful, it also struggles with hurdles that even basic stories should be practically immune to.Invulnerability breaks immersion, and is one of the issues I had with ""Tenet"" 15 years later. That alone inhibits this movie from ascending into hallowed ground, condemning it to just being a worthwhile watch."
"Review of The Prestige : The answer to that question is ""no."" Although I found the story quite fascinating and overall, the film well done--another great performance by Michael Caine--in order for it to really work, the audience has to be rooting for someone. As the movie progresses, we find each of the 2 magicians and the women less and less likeable. A look at illusions and magic ""backstage"" was educational, and I certainly was not bored. However, the conclusion that one magician used cloning was a disappointment as it is impossible, at least in the way it was done in the film. But the worst pill to swallow: although I haven't read ALL the reviews here, I haven't found anyone who addressed the callousness of a twin sacrificing his brother's life as one of them did in the story. And do we REALLY know which one survived?"
Review of The Prestige : Basically a movie about some these guys who destroy the lives of everyone they meet because they can't come to terms with how in love they are. Hopefully neither got custody of the kid. Pretty messed up all around. Still a fun watch though so 7/10
"Review of The Prestige : What can I say, wow! I almost missed this movie in theaters. I looked at number of reviews and got a sense that this movie is about obsessed magician revivals, and how important professional life to those who care. Yesterday, while rearranging my Netflix queue I noticed to my surprise that movie is one of 250 best rated movies. So after short research I found one theater where movie was still playing. Movie certainly was worth the effort. It is somewhat similar to ""Usual Suspects"", but better since, I can much easily associate myself with magician then with criminal. I tracked at least three nested stories, it has absolutely unexpected ending, and movie is very logical if you analyze it afterward. Scarlett Johansson acting was average but other actors just took me there. I believed every word. If you can still catch it in a theater, go, and if not happy DVD viewing."
"Review of The Prestige : I liked this movie in that it's a nice story with interesting characters, beautiful imagery and decent actors. But like many other movies in the last years, this movie has a surprising plot twist at the end. In this movie I didn't particularly like it, and probably for two reasons. The first and main one is, the whole ""plot twist"" thing is getting rather old if you ask me. We've seen so many of these movies lately (The Sixth Sense, The Others, The Village, The Usual Suspects, Memento, The Illusionist, The Score, Unbreakable, etc. etc.) that it doesn't really impress anymore. Oh sure, it's nice to catch the viewers by surprise and say ""Ha! You didn't see that coming, did you?"" But then again, is it really that hard? In a world where the viewer is *expected* to ""suspend his disbelief"" and the writer has all the power to either show or not show information, you can make your viewers believe anything. In the beginning, or at least what was the beginning of this ""genre"" for me (The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects), it was still funny and unexpected. You felt tricked and kinda stupid when you learned the truth. But the more of these films you see, the more you realize how easy it is to surprise someone if you have absolute control over what information is or isn't shown. And, the more far-fetched the plot twists seem to get, which is the 2nd reason I wasn't really impressed by the ending of this film. It seems to have become a silly game among film makers much like the game in this film: a match to see who is best able to trick their audience, and who can come up with an even more insane plot twist. In this case it is insane indeed, or rather an insult the viewers intelligence if you want my opinion. Sure, just pull a proverbial bunny out of a hat by the end of the film like ""Hey, what about THIS then eh?"". Yeah, unexpected indeed, but cheap, really cheap. As someone else commented on this film: the makers seem to have worried more about delivering the best plot twist to date, than about making a good film, and executing the twist properly and credibly. Half way through the film, I was no longer really bothered by the issue that, at the end of the film, the plot twist appeared to offer a solution for. Part of this is because my ""suspension of disbelief"" had pushed the whole issue to the background. And part of it is because the film just doesn't keep you focused. There's so much other stuff going on that you aren't really sure what to look for. At a certain point I was waiting for unexpected answers when I didn't know what the question was.Nevertheless, I still gave this film a 7 out of 10, because in itself I thought it was a good story and I enjoyed watching most of it. However I do hope that film makers will invent a new genre and stop doing the plot twist thing because frankly, I think we've all seen how that trick works by now so it isn't really going to work anymore."
"Review of The Prestige : After seeing that this film is in the IMDb top 100, I thought it was a film I must see. Now that I've seen it, I feel a bit disappointed. Now I must admit that the film was terribly original and had some odd twists, though the film overall is awfully grim and lifeless--mostly because it was hard connecting with the characters.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play magicians who are partners. Things go very well for a while until Jackman's wife is accidentally killed doing a dangerous trick. Jackman blames Bale for this and you really can't tell if Bale did anything wrong or if it was just a sad tragedy. Regardless, Jackman spends the rest of the film persecuting Bale and trying to destroy him. After a while, Bale begins fighting back and it's an all-out war with horrible consequences. I won't say more--because I don't want to spoil the film. However, I will say that it gets really, really, really weird when Nicola Tesla (played very well by David Bowie) enters the fray--creating the ultimate magical box for Jackman.Aside from the magic box being ridiculously anachronistic, the film is so slow and hard to love--despite it's wonderful twists. It's hard to like either of the magicians (particularly Jackman) and after a while I lost interest--mostly because of the pacing and disagreeable characters. Overall, I greatly respect the film but also didn't particularly enjoy watching it."
"Review of The Prestige : I don't like horror films, but these days, most thrillers tend to be packaged as horror films, so I was pleasantly surprised to see the commercials for the Prestige when it first came out. I didn't get to see it then. Too much going on, and more important movies to see when I did go to the theatre.I have to say, after waiting so long, I'm glad I didn't. I'm very underwhelmed by it.Hugh Jackman was a bit stiff in this, and that makes me worry, because I know he can pull off good acting. The rest of the performances were generally lovely, though.The flow was a bit confusing at first, but not overly so, and as time went on, everything was set in its proper time frame. But I do think people who like linear films would have difficulty with the first hour or so of the film.The sequences with Tesla felt like they should have been in a different story. Something more action-oriented. They didn't fit with the flow of the rest, really, and were only there for the big shocker, and to give Bowie his cameo. I would much rather have seen a growing thread of mishaps and attacks from each of them as Angier worked out the secret.The ending left me cold, and to be honest, rather ill. I think the writer sold himself short. Or thought they were writing an episode of Twilight Zone.Borden's secret was obvious less than halfway through the movie or so, and while it did seem as though at times they might have been working towards another explanation, in the end, it turned out to be just what it seemed.All in all, a vaguely interesting story if you're into stage magicians, or are fond of the actors involved, but not at all what it could have been, given the right attention."
Review of The Prestige : I don't know why this movie has such a high score. The movie is ok but there are much better films that have lower scores.
"Review of The Prestige : If I were to judge this movie just on the quality of the acting and the beauty of the photography, costumes, set design, and even 90% of the dialog, this would get 9 stars. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to people who go to the movies to see a spectacular looking period piece. Jackman and Bale do superb jobs as the centerpieces of the film's story, the supporting case is dead on (including Michael Caine - which didn't surprise me - and David Bowie - which did).But the ambitious screenplay is so riddled with sloppy plotting and unfair plot devices that it almost sinks the film.I can appreciate the difficulty of what Nolan and Nolan are trying to pull off here, and I am familiar with the work of Christopher Priest (who wrote the novel the screenplay is based on). But, simply put, the screenplay cheats like a bastard. It promises us an amazingly clever game of cat-and-mouse between two gifted and obsessive geniuses. It promises us a dazzling resolution which will astound us with its deviousness and cause us to slap our foreheads in delight, because we ""should have seen it coming"". (Kind of like some of the old ""Columbo"" episodes). ***GENERAL SPOILERS FOLLOW*** Instead it presents an out-of-left-field plot development that is completely unjustified by what went before, lies to us about the premises of another plot device that it then uses to drive the entire latter portion of the movie, and presents us with a couple of protagonists who are morally repellent and seemingly dumber than rocks.***DETAILED SPOILERS FOLLOW****I don't want to waste your time (and mine) detailing all the ways the screenplay fouls up, but I will mention a couple.1) If Angier is so devastated by his wife's death in the stage accident early in the movie (as a result of Bordon's ""carelessness"" in tying the knots), and has such a need for vengeance, it seems to be that he ought to save at least SOME of his wrath for his friend Cutter, who designed the water tank in the first place. How hard would it have been to make one of the glass sides in the water tank thin enough (say, the one in the back that the audience couldn't see directly) so that it could be broken with one swing of a sledge in an emergency? How hard would it have been to TEST the tank when it was full to see how long it actually took to break it? For that matter, how hard would it have been to train Angier's wife to hold her breath for 3 minutes - a feat any stage magician and illusionist learns very early in his career? Any of these precautions would have saved the women's life when things went wrong, yet Angier blames Borden alone.2) Early on, trying to solve the puzzle of Borden's great trick ""The Transported Man"", Angier and Cutter discard the possibility that Borden is using a look-a-like because Angier's new assistant claims that the ""double"" also has mutilated fingers, and no double could duplicate Borden's mutilated fingers. That's not valid reasoning. Times back then were tough enough that people routinely mutilated themselves so they could pass as cripples to beg for money, and women prostituted themselves for small change. Plenty of people back then (and even now) would jump at the chance to trade two fingers for a steady income and financial security. OK, I'll buy it if the film insists...these are supposed to be the smartest guys in their field, after all...BUT: What do you know! It turns out that Borden not only uses a look-a-like after all, he has a TWIN who submitted to having his fingers mutilated! I got so angry when I saw this that I nearly walked out of the theater.That's cheating - it's not clever and magician-like at all....it's just the act of an obsessive creep who doesn't have the skill or the wit to live up to the art of deception and misdirection that is supposed to be the stage magician's reason for being. Most of all, it doesn't live up to the premise that drove the latter half of the screenplay - that he's not using a double because a double wouldn't have mutilated fingers.Similarly, Angier spends years and a fortune (where'd the money come from? The movie mostly shows us performances that end in disaster!) trying to solve Borden's ""Transported Man"" trick...instead of actually simply trying to come up with a BETTER trick. The guy is supposed to be this ""brilliant"" stage magician, and yet all he can do is copy another guy's act?? Does ANYone buy this? I've just scratched the surface here: Problems and psychological inconsistencies and morally repulsive actions riddle the movie from beginning to end...not the least of which ***BIG SPOILER FOLLOWS!**** is when the Nolan brothers choose to pull a freak science fiction plot device out of nowhere in what was an interesting period mystery piece and character study. Wait a minute - the whole premise of the film is the secrecy and mystery of illusion and stagecraft. To pull a trick off with HARD SCIENCE (no matter how impressive) is to basically say, ""Nope, these characters suck, and we aren't smart enough to make our premise work. Sorry, hope you like the new direction!!"" If the acting weren't so good, if most of the dialog wasn't so spot on, if the movie didn't look so brilliant, I'd slam ""The Prestige"" non stop to everyone I know. And yet I STILL like it enough to rank it as a ""7"" when the plot barely merits a ""4"". As it is, I have to advise the first time viewer to suspend his critical thinking facilities and just drink in the mood."
"Review of The Prestige : As a guest at the world premier of this film, held at the El Capitan in Hollywood on October 17, 2006, I can say that not only did I enjoy it very much, but that the enthusiasm with which the audience received it seemed genuine and unaffected by the presence of those principals who attended.Among the many virtues of this film are the exquisite cinematography, the solid writing and story line, the respect with which magic is treated, and the fabulous acting. Michael Caine, to those paying attention, really steals the show with his characteristic understated mien.The presentation of magic is very well done; and the art of magic is obviously revered. As this reviewer understands it, the film was largely shot on a closed set, and only those who needed to be privy to how the actual magic effects were accomplished had access when those scenes were shot.The characters, for the most part, were three dimensional and their motives adequately justified their actions. If one could wish for more in this regard, it would be to have some more back-story on the leading characters.Which, as it happens, runs counter to my main criticism of this film: It is too long. It is too long by 15 or 20 minutes. Still, whence to cut those 15 or 20 minutes is very difficult to say. There is no one scene that, in retrospect, seems expendable. The paring might best be done one frame at a time; but however it is done, the film needs to be shorter.My only other criticisms of the film (and herein resides my spoiler) are that there is no explanation of how the Tesla device reproduces the object in its field, and neither is there an explanation of how the point at which the reproduction appears can be set. A minor criticism, because it could have been handled in one or two lines of dialog, is that Angier's (Hugh Jackman) dual consciousness is not explained. In fact, Cutter (Michael Caine) recounts a drowning story in such a way as to indicate that the transported Angier wouldn't know the agony of drowning. Yet the film briefly shows two Angiers simultaneously conscious, implying that both of them could have continued Angier's life with full access to his life's continuum.The film, although it tests the audience's ability to suspend disbelief, is rich enough overall to warrant a hearty recommendation. It will be an Oscar contender."
"Review of The Prestige : The Prestige is a good movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a bizarre journey as we follow the lives of two competing magicians who go through extreme lengths to exceed the other. Things begin to heat up quite fast, with some very bizarre twists and turns throughout, showcasing the complications these magicians go through to make everything appear magic. However. I felt the plot dives deeper than it really should have, there are some very absurd moments and the exaggeration took me out of the movie a bit. I also found the tone far too dark, it should have been a more light hearted look at the dedication of magicians, instead of going as far as to bring teleportation, cloning and suicide in to the story. While it can feel a bit pretentious, The Prestige is a really unique movie, worth the watch if you are looking for a good mystery. Two magicians begin to feud after one performs the ultimate trick, teleportation. Best Performance: Christian Bale"
Review of The Prestige : The structure of this story is amazing pulled off by Christopher Nolan .The story of an extreme rivalry between two magicians is great and carried by some great and really underrated performances by Christian bale and hugh Jackman. A must see and a personal favorite
"Review of The Prestige : Honestly, I think I would need to watch it again to tell you whether I think it's a good movie or not. Of course, it's filled with such amazing actors and I really liked the mystery all along, but the thing is I think it is way too long. Although, I recommend it."
"Review of The Prestige : Enjoyable film IF viewer ignores obvious plot flaws. Hugh Jackman is born in ""top class"" in England, meaning he would speak, & have an affluent aura during this time period. He would be forced to act, speak, eat & posses the mannerism of a low class working peasant, which would be exhausting and a magic act in itself.The other big flaw is Bale's double & all prosthetics he wears as disguises. Caine's character is a master & experienced ""magician engineer"" who creates doubles. How can Caine & Hugh NOT see all the fake disguises on Bale's secret double, especially after capturing & interrogating him? Hollywood mission impossible style facial make up wasn't invented yet. Even if modern disguises were used, in real life, one can spot such disguises, especially bc they're BOTH magicians. Viewer gets to see plethora of facial fake parts in Bale's home, & they look truly fake. Last, Caine switching allegiance because he sees the truth at the end- Jackman has so much $$ & freedom due to his birthright, he could have kept his secret from Caine & the ending would've been very different.Acting is excellent from entire cast. If one can not dwell on obvious plot flaws, this film is enjoyable & rewatchable."
"Review of The Prestige : THE PRESTIGE is a fascinating, satisfying if flawed look at magicians and passion through the lens of a thinking man's director using details of turn of the century history as his palate. Most satisfying if you're up to following the unexpected details, but it must have been frustrating for the releasing studio to try and figure our how to SELL the film when it first came out.Is it a simple classic costume mystery? (It isn't) Do you give away that there may be science fiction elements? (They didn't - to even hint that there may have been some inspiration in the STAR TREK series and its fictional technology might have been a major spoiler, but without buying into that concept, the film has a serious logistic flaw - and the mere incorporation of references to the period science - heavily extrapolated - of Nicholas Tesla wasn't enough to get the point across for many) Are the great Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale big enough stars to simply sell it as a vehicle? (At that point they weren't) The film didn't find its initial audience and went to DVD all too soon, but it's rightly developing a fair cult now, because it IS a fascinating experience for audiences knowledgeable enough to bring at least some awareness of Nicholas Tesla (the Sci-Si Channel's great series EUREKA has helped a lot on this front), willing to actually pay attention to Nolan's complex story telling which uses the flash-back and flash-forward more effectively than most recent films, willing to take a leap of faith or two and anxious to enjoy the excellent work from a uniformly superb cast and director.It is all too tempting to see the first shadings of director Nolan's lighter but more complex ""thinking man's extravaganza,"" INCEPTION, in THE PRESTIGE. Both are films which require an audience willing to pay full attention and actually LISTEN, not just lie back and wait for the car crashes and exploding buildings to entertain them. Both are stories which use the pain of lost love to unexpected advantage motivating their core characters. Both are immensely rewarding to those willing to THINK and not just absorb.In the film and real life ""the prestige"" is a magician's term for the final reveal which makes a trick pay off. On DVD, THE PRESTIGE is a prestige item serious film buffs will want to savor more than once."
"Review of The Prestige : I have a particular perspective on this movie, being myself a stage hypnotist. Whilst my art is quite distinct from that of illusionists such as are depicted in this movie (although I have performed as such also) the two fields do overlap and in the broadest common usage I am often referred to as a magician. Many aspects of the story I found to resonate with me on a personal level.I emphasise the story because that is what sustains this production. I have'nt read the original (though I have earlier work by the same author) but the screenplay sustains attention through what might otherwise be judged an overlong piece. To be frank, the movie starts slowly and dwells excessively on many scenes, some of which are irrelevant to the plot and could have been omitted with no loss. For example the one with the prank on the prison warder.The sets, photography, costumes, performances are all excellent but one would not sit through it just for those aspects. Until the story cranked up some momentum I regarded the movie as yet another to make jokes about rather than being engaged by. Indeed I chuckled when a magicians ""secret"" is revealed in mysterious seclusion as what appears to be a gigantic metronome with its cover on(it isn't, but looks like one). The slow start is not entirely the directors fault and in this respect the writing falls short of its overall quality. Deliberate humour is actually one thing entirely absent from the movie, which may be appropriate given the dark subject matter. However, the early parts, with a story told using intercut viewpoints and time-frames, flash-backs and flash-forwards is really rather confusing.There are sub-texts in the story which extend beyond the immediate tale itself and these are subtly flagged up in the script. The ambiguity of identity is only the most obvious theme. The best feature of the realisation only become apparent when one has already watched it and the metaphors hidden in plain sight throughout become retrospectively apparent. In a way, this is something of a magic trick in itself. Perhaps the attention spent on what I have suggested to be ""irrelevent"" scenes are after all a kind of mis-direction. A kind of magic!"
"Review of The Prestige : The main purpose of magic is not to impress others nor to deceive them, but to simply give the illusion of something fake appear real for artistic purposes. That is lesson incorporated in this dark fantasy period piece starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as rival magicians in an intensifying battle to discover the truth of each other. Set with an intelligent, but convoluted plot and a visually alluring design of nineteenth century England, this movie sees director Christopher Nolan delivering his signature filmmaking tropes and bringing them together to form a dazzling mix of fantasy, suspense, and mystery elements in a story that like most of Nolan's works, drives with a fair amount of complexity and emotional twist; though suffers some occasional blemishes in the narrative department. Based on the novel by British author Christopher Priest, the film tells the story of Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Bordon (played by Christian Bale), two magicians who sustain a friendship as assistants for their town's magic shows run by master magician John Cutter (played by Michael Caine). But one night during a show, their performance goes terribly wrong that results in tragedy. The fateful event turns their duo's friendship into a bitter rivalry and soon leads to the two in an obsessive battle to discover each other's secrets. It's not long before their heated rivalry escalates into a downward spiral of deceit that threatens to not only tear apart their careers on stage, but their own personal beings. As this film deals with magic and sorcery, it should come to no surprise that Christopher Nolan brings a wide plethora of twists to the mix; and with a smoothly compelling script and striking visual resonance, Nolan appears to be at the top of his game. Wielding with spectacular directorial talent, Nolan drives this film with plenty of nuance and astounding visual potency. As the story revolves around a heated competition of revenge and deception that makes for some very dark and occasionally morbid moments, it pulls into a dark, eerie journey of Christopher Priest's novel with plenty of surprises supplemented by Nolan's stylish direction. Though the plot holds a fair amount of intelligence, the unnecessarily slow pacing does tend to kill the interest of the story. Instead of introducing the lead magicians at the beginning, the film proceeds through a non-linear narrative opening with Christian Bale's character Alfred on murder trail (for reasons you don't learn until later) which becomes intertwined throughout the story until the very end, before giving us the proper introduction on the characters. Along with this another subplot centering on famous inventor Nikola Tesla who's oddly played by singer David Bowie, trying to invent a teleporter. Nolan's use of non-linear storytelling not only overcomplicates the plot, but he doesn't execute in a way that is effective as what he achieved in 'Memento'. On the bright side, this director manages to keep things moving at least most of the time, and builds up the story up to a shocking, unpredictable conclusion. The performances by Christian Bale , fresh off of Nolan's 'Batman Begins', and Hugh Jackman both stand out; and the supporting cast including Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson as Robert Angier's assistant also make great appeal in their roles. While nothing particularly Oscar-worthy, these actors manage to fit the bill.The Prestige, though slightly inferior to Christoper Nolan's other works, is a smart, dazzling fantasy period piece with alluring energy of Nolan's directorial efforts and a fine array of charismatic performances by a likable cast. Though the level of complexity in the plot make the story a challenge for the most naive film goers to sit through, it also serves as a reminder of the fine cinematic talent Nolan never stops bringing to the screen."
Review of The Prestige : Both a natural and supernatural mystery. One might expect one but not the other. Excellent cast. Great premise. But the reveal was both anticipated and obscured as the lines of the genres were blurred. I'll leave you to figure out this riddle. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Mystery Drama}
"Review of The Prestige : The movie it self was a tough one to understand. Maybe the first 30 minutes are hard but once you figured out the characters, the plot, the background and so forth. You see nolan is responsible for a really good feature. Both Christian bale are hugh Jackman are fantastic in their portrayals and Michael Caine is even better. I really liked that even if it's not based on a true story then it involved real characters such as nicola Tesla and adison. Great portrayal of David Bowie. The plot is complicated but I enjoyed how the characters outsmarted each other in every occasion. Great job nolan."
"Review of The Prestige : What might audiences find when peeking behind the curtain on this vaudeville act? A tense period piece, maybe a transcontinental thriller or perhaps a meditation on movie magic? This dense turn-of-the-century tale is all of those and more, proving Christopher Nolan to be a Hollywood heavy-hitter way back in 2006, and captivating audiences with its spell-binding and complex method for nearly two decades. Assembling his A-team of now-celebrated collaborators for this study on stage sleight-of-hand, such as cinematographer Wally Pfister and production designer Nathan Crowley, the British director is in true command of his craft for the film's somewhat-bloated 130 minutes, at times confounding and confusing viewers due in no small part to its marquee misdirection and sluggish pace. Leading lads Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale steal the show in dual roles as duelling magicians across three acts, daring audiences to sympathise with each protagonist as they pursue Faustian-like pacts with deadly consequences. Michael Caine and David Bowie are deserving of much praise, but sadly Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson find their talents wasted in under-written roles, did someone say dead wife trope? One-upmanship, pride and obsession are the name of the game during the pledge, turn and eponymous prestige, but the film flounders as it covers far too much thematic territory for its own good, and refuses to settle for any singular focus. Peeling back its layers reveals a fractal filmmaking style, trademark elliptical editing and marvellous use of mise en abyme, all of which would be improved in later Nolan features, yet this experience does demand your attention and encourage repeat viewings where keen eyes hope to spot every trick. Abracadabra.7/10 black cats and top hats."
Review of The Prestige : I liked The Prestige but this is seriously higher rated than Citizen Kane? The Prestige wasn't even the best movie the year it came out. Citizen Kane is on top of every list. These ratings need to be overhauled. The prestige is solid though but a 7.7 or something would be a lot more reasonable.
"Review of The Prestige : Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Christian Bale & Hugh Jackman star in the story of 2 friends & colleagues turned deadly enemies.A couple of illusionists who start off by working together suddenly turn against each other after the wife of one of them dies during an underwater illusion in which she is the assistant.The widower illusionist then turns on his friend blaming him for his wife's death & causes him to lose his fingers during an illusion which then sparks the 2 men to begin a dangerous vendetta against each other as they then become determined to steal each other's illusions & so on.The film is complicated in parts as it's a bit back & forth but it is interesting & definitely worth a watch so give it a go if you haven't already as you won't be disappointed."
"Review of The Prestige : How in the world is this in the top 250 movies of all-time? The performances are nothing to write home about- Bale's Cockney accent is laughable, as in it made me laugh the whole movie, the reason I first gave this movie a 3, Jackman might as well have been a statue, and apparently Nolan never told Caine that he wasn't still playing Alfred between Batman movies. The only way someone could enjoy this movie is if they were somehow ""fooled"" by the ""twists"". First of all, a twist is when you believe something and that something turns out not to be true. So there are no ""twists"" in this movie, because there is nothing to believe, the audience simply doesn't understand and the reason is eventually presented. Saying this movie has ""twists"" would be like saying someone performing card tricks has ""twisted"" your life. Second, I don't know how it's possible to be fooled by anything in this movie. It is obvious that Fallon is a double for Bale the entire movie, although I thought he was only a look-a-like, he was his twin brother. They say the entire movie you have to ""live"" your trick.They keep telling the wives and girlfriends ""a part of me"" and ""I loved you yesterday"" Then, how can anyone be fooled with anything in the ending? You know the machine clones things, why didn't you know Jackman was still alive.Which brings me to the point of what is this movie about exactly? It's about two loser magician twins, one of whom makes his wife commit suicide and the other denies his true love and gets hanged- all of this for what? Magic!! It's also about another loser magician who's wife drowns(the only real magic in the movie by the way)- and then receives a clone machine(now it's a sci-fi movie for some reason), which he uses to upstage the other two loser magicians (and mass murder), causing the remaining loser twin to shoot and kill him. And this is in the top 250? I take it back, I see the ""twist"" now.... that's magic!!"
"Review of The Prestige : Christopher Nolan, the co-writer/director, loves to over-complicate his films a lot, especially in his twists in the endings, and counts on the simplicity of the masses to get confused and be called a genius despite failing to deliver in his films' ultimate goals: the twists at the end, because most of his films rely on those heavily to be given any meaning or quality at all. In this fairly long-running drama, Bale (as usual) and Jackman produce high quality performances, and special credit given to Bale's wife in the film and David Bowie (who can really act !); in an otherwise strong cinematography flick. The main issue is that the film builds up a great momentum, with lots of twists and turns, but as we're held in suspense for the grande finale at the end, lots of if not everything that's been mounted before seems to crumble as we discover the truth unfolded in the dying, yes *dying*, moments of this disappointment. It's like the end discredits everything that's been building for long chunks of Nolan produce, like the film shoots itself in the foot (or in the head ?). Too bad. This feels like a great, but it surely isn't."
"Review of The Prestige : First things first; the acting is excellent by one and all, especially the great Michael Caine. The characters on the other hand were disgusting. The way these two behaved and the atrocities they committed made me wish they both died. The little girl should have been raised by Cutter. This movie made me sick to my stomach. Both characters were utterly demonic."
"Review of The Prestige : ""The Prestige"" has everything a film need to be great: two lead actors named Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, for the first time together, a supporting cast including Micheal Caine and Scarlett Johansonn - I felt Johansonn was kind of useless here, though - and the direction of acclaimed Christopher Nolan. Still, it's ultimately unconvincing. Probably it will do big bucks, but don't be fooled by the current 8.5/ 10 user rating: the film's no masterpiece. Sure, it has its high points: great production values, with wonderful costumes and a gorgeous art direction - which succeeded in creating the visionary, sci-fi Victorian age that ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" tried in vain to create with massive digital effects in 2003 - . Most of the performances are strong; the best, in my opinion, is Jackman's. Bale is just a step lower. What didn't convince me is the script. It use a series of cross flashbacks which didn't always work well. The plot, very convoluted, is sometimes repetitive. The ""surpise ending"" is not that big surprise if you have paid attention. Even if its atmosphere of is definitely dark, with some brutal scenes, the Prestige is nothing other than a magic trick played to the audience: it will entertain you for a while, but will leave you nothing much. Maybe's my fault, but I was expecting much more. My rating is 6/10"
"Review of The Prestige : I just saw this movie and did have a good time watching it. I never felt bored with it even though it was a bit long. My wife loved it and I can see how some people would. It was pretty well put together, good acting, & a few good special effects. It did keep you guessing...almost too much. By the end of the movie I was wondering what the next 'twist' would be. Some of them you saw coming, some were not so obvious but it was apparent that the author of this story was trying to keep you guessing about the nature of good and evil and made it difficult to pick out who was good and who was bad. My only true gripe with the movie was the second act. After reading a review of the book I found that I wasn't alone on this. Some people will let it pass and just enjoy the movie but I couldn't. The movie takes a drastic turn to the super-natural (even though they half heartedly try to explain it as inexplicable science). Normally I wouldn't be put off by science-fiction or magic or whatever but this movie started off like it was based in reality and then just changed. If they could have created a plot device that would serve the same purpose as Hugh Jackman's ultimate trick without the super-natural I probably would have enjoyed it more. I think most people will enjoy this and if you're interested you shouldn't avoid it because of my comments. It was still a well done movie, it just isn't for everyone."
"Review of The Prestige : Great movie!!! .. or so I thought. Christopher Nolan is a good director. Not a great one, but a good director. This, and other works of his, prove that.6/10 may be my fault since I raised my expectations quite high for this one. I heard about it, and decided to delight myself with a 'masterpiece'.To be objective, the film could've scored 7-8/10, but only if there were a permanent power failure in the world and I wouldn't have seen the finale.Tesla teleporting hats, cats and people for a living? Come on! That means that Friedrich Nietzsche was selling donuts to buy Jaguar wheels. That was disappointing.I understand that film is 90% fiction, but Nolan, next time stay away from putting real (historical) figures do some fictional facts. Nobody likes it.The other 99% of the movie, is filled with thrill, a great plot, some good situation turns and such.I really couldn't say that I wasted 130 minutes of my life. I wasted only 5 with this movie. Even the credits were more interesting than the finale.Tip: If you're reading this and planning to watch the movie, throw soda on your TV near the end, and don't buy a new one. That way you'll really like this movie! Over and out!"
"Review of The Prestige : I think Maybe, because of all the positive reviews on this movie.I couldn't wait to see it.My wife didn't like it.To many twists for her to follow.I didn't like the heavy accents,at times hard to understand.I didn't think there was much magic either,not like the illusionist.I thought was so much better.We never knew why he would keep using someone that screwed him so much or the girl either? It didn't make a lot of sense and the ending was sorta dumb.The guy got hung for something he didn't do. Oh well goes to show you don't believe what you read.I think the emphases should have been more on the stealing of secrets which was OK,And a lot more magic.One minute they were dirt poor next minute rich?I didn't like the hurting aspect of the grudge.ruin each other OK,shooting one not so cool"
"Review of The Prestige : After seeing the movie, I was surprised by the number of 8, 9, and 10 stars that people gave it, saying things like it was ""the best movie of the year"". I must disagree. This is a movie worth watching for entertainment's sake, since individual aspects of the movie are top notch, but overall I would leave movie of the year to something like The Departed instead.Pro's:1) Very good acting 2) Unique plot 3) Nice effects, especially when you see how magic ""really"" gets done 4) Believable characters -you definitely empathize with both main characters, despite their treachery 5) Extremely tight plot. It brings to mind the Harry Potter books, actually - every little detail is important and plays a role. Things that you are think are periphery turn out to lead you to the conclusion. Good foreshadowingCon's:1) So, so so predictable. I was shocked that people were surprised by the ending 2) Inconsistent idea. This movie tried to be about two things. It wanted to be about the plot twist/rivalry, but it also had a theme in the age-old ""is there magic"" question. As stated in the previews and other reviews, there're some surreal sci-fi aspects to the movie. This was very disappointing. 3) There are a few irritating inconsistencies that just make it hard to suspend belief and get into the movie. I won't put any spoilers here - but suffice it to say the movie lost cohesiveness in anything involving sci fi or the final twist.4) The flash-forward flash-back nature of the story telling did not add anything to the mystery of the story - it just leaves you irritated and confused for the first 20 minutes (who is reading whose diary again? Is this before or after the last thing that happened? etc)All in all, the plot was very well constructed and the idea was great. In general the acting was good and it was well directed. It was just missing that extra ""oomph"" that turns and interesting movie into a fabulous one. There was something a little too predictable about all of the plot twists, and something a little inconsistent about the theme of the movie that prevented me from really praising it."
"Review of The Prestige : ""It is inhuman to be so cold"", says one of the film's characters, and that's what ""The Prestige"" (2006) directed by Christopher Nolan is above all. It is technically well done, it is dark, it is twisted (too many twists to my taste) and it could be described as ""Memento"" meets ""Rashômon"" judging by the way the story of obsession, rivalry, hatred, and losing all human feelings has been told. Yes, it is well done by in the end I don't care about any of its main characters because more than anything, their story reminds of Atreus and Thyestes, two brothers from the Greek Mythology where each would go very far to hurt and to humiliate the sibling. The tricks are magic but when there is nothing but hatred (and some science fiction thrown in for more effect) behind the magic, I don't want to be tricked. I prefer ""The Illusionist"" that was released the same year -there is love and light behind the secrets and tricks, and I want to stay there."
"Review of The Prestige : It's not very often I feel the urge to write a (small) review of a movie I've seen on IMDb. This one however, ranked #73 on the IMDb by the time I watched it, makes me feel I have to state my opinion.With a great cast and a wonderful director this movie seems to have everything to make it awesome. At first it does not disappoint. With it's non chronological narrative it sets out to be an intelligent story that like it's subject (magic) will provide many surprises.The eventual plot however could easily suck a golf ball through a garden hose. Imagine Shawshank Redemption or American Beauty ending with a UFO landing explaining all the unanswered questions. We can praise the element of surprise but it still would not fit the story. I feel the same way about The Prestige. Too bad they could not come up with an ending or plot that would have suited the high quality of the rest of the movie!"
"Review of The Prestige : When I read a few comments on the film and checked the IMDb rating, just before watching the movie, expectancies were high.And I must say, it is a very well made movie. The cast is good, the acting is solid, really no problem there. Same goes for the decors, photography - the movie is a joy to watch, even if the part in the icy woods in Colorado Springs felt very artificial, plastic - like.Only one weak point then as far as I'm concerned: the plot. I felt it was very predictable, from, let's say, the second half of the movie on. The fact that ""real magic"" (a machine that duplicates objects or creatures) was used in the plot, was a major disappointment to me. A beautiful movie then. But not really an intelligent one. Overrated if you ask me. Good entertainment, but nothing more. I gave it a 6/10."
"Review of The Prestige : The first time I saw The Prestige I was absolutely blown away by it. I was staring at the screen, slack jawed, halfway through the credits. The twist ending in this is phenomenal and mind-bending... the first time. Once you know the twist, however, it seems like the film has no point. Watch it once, have your mind blown and then just let that be the film experience you associate with this film, because the second time is just disappointing."
"Review of The Prestige : There is not too much to say about this film and I believe that speaks the most about the story as a whole. Throughout the movie, tension does continue to build but by the midway point it seems to taper off and really falls flat by the climax. I think that once the element of fictional magic (teleportation) is entered into the story, the intrigue and wonder died. What makes a magicians performance so impressive is that he has done something that you know is possible, but has made it appear impossible. In this movie, the magician has done something that the viewer knows is impossible, which thus makes it not impressive. The only twist/impressive magical trick that occurs was the hidden act between the twin brothers, but other than that, this movie was quite uninteresting and distastefully predictable in almost every aspect."
"Review of The Prestige : In 1890s London, two magicians--once protégés of the same aging illusionist--consistently undercut each other on and off the stage, reveling in the one-upmanship; Hugh Jackman has the show business flair, while rough-hewn toughie Christian Bale is more intent on conquering the intricacies of unexplainable magic. Using rather obvious ploys (like phony beards and wigs, not to mention Scarlett Johansson as an assistant/secret agent), they each work as much on sabotaging the other's latest success as developing their own skills. This fantastic tale, directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan from the novel by Christopher Priest, might have bowled us over with a few cunning twists; unfortunately, the baffling screenplay reminds one more of H. G. Wells than ""Sleuth"", coming up with a bag of tricks so far-fetched it removes the film's core of inherent reality. The film is remarkably well-dressed and crafted, although the jumpy editing at the start (darting around in time before settling into a more conventional mode of storytelling) is rather a nuisance. The acting is solid throughout, even as the plot-gimmicks become more and more ridiculous, leading to a depressing and flat conclusion. **1/2 from ****"
"Review of The Prestige : A very clever film (not surprising for a film about a couple of magicians) that is so concerned with being clever, that it becomes a little confusing. I was left thinking I needed to watch it again, not because of the pleasure I had watching it, but because I wasn't sure I ""got it,"" completely. The problem was that I had absolutely no sympathy for the two magicians who were so self absorbed, and mean spirited in their relentless ambition to out-do each other, that I couldn't bring myself to watch it again. Also, I think it was a little too long for what it was, to the point of getting a little tedious. All this is not to say that there aren't some positives. Firstly, the cinematography in this film is outstanding. I saw this on DVD, but I can imagine it would be great on the big screen. The wardrobe and set design where excellent, which really helped bring an aura of authenticity to this period piece. The acting was pretty darn good as well, which is no surprise, considering the veteran talent in the cast. I enjoyed seeing David Bowie as Nicolai Tesla; he so transformed into this character that I didn't realize at first who the actor was. Also, it added an element of interest to call attention to Tesla the man, whose visionary theories are considered revolutionary, even in modern times. Although duplicating people...this may be a little much even for Tesla. But I'm no expert on Tesla. The Presence of Scarlett Johansson in the cast was also one of the reasons I wanted to see this film. Her role here, though, was a little on the insubstantial side. Not surprisingly, she is cast typically (it seems, lately) as the smokin' hot eye candy of the film. She certainly is capable of playing character roles of much more depth, as I have seen in films such as ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" for example. Nonetheless, I think she did do a good job here, for what it was. So all in all, I would have to say that for me this was a mildly interesting and entertaining film, though certainly not highly compelling or memorable."
"Review of The Prestige : In a magic trick it usually consists of a hook, line, and sinker. The magician presents the scenario, proves its impossibility, and then defies the odds. How the trick is pulled off, magicians usually don't reveal. In movie-making however, it doesn't quite work in the same fashion. If you present a film that raises questions and the end of the final act does not answer them, then you have yourself a panned and wildly criticized film. The only kinds of questions that can remain unanswered are that which bare little importance to the main plot itself. Tarantino mastered this, by giving unanswered questions to almost all his films (Best example: Briefcase in Pulp Fiction). The Prestige however, suffers awfully from being unable to answer important questions. While the movie itself is entertaining, albeit a bit long, it fails to wrap up the story the way really good films do, like its rival 2006 magician hit The Illusionist. The hook and line are bearable to watch, but the sinker fails to satisfy. While it did give its nice twists and turns, The Prestige does not leave a satisfying finish.Rivalries can be very ugly. Take the Yankees-Red Sox, Bears-Packers, Canada-United States, Tupac-B.I.G., and Coke-Pepsi as pure examples. Some can be friendly, some can result in tension, and others result in worse. In the case of The Prestige, we have two magicians ready to kill each other if the opportunity was given. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rival magicians that are so hell-bent on figuring out the other's latest tricks and amazing acts that they will put their families, even their lives on the line. Meanwhile, Cutter (Michael Caine) is in the middle of it all, trying to end the foolish rivalry before it escalates into something more. Throughout the film you see each person gain the upper hand in terms of skills, success, and happiness more than once, but like a seesaw it goes back and forth until the final moments.Handling this grim and dark tale of competition is an all-star cast, an accomplished director, and David Bowie? Anyways, Christopher Nolan, who has been acclaimed as one of the better current directors out there, directs this film with a technique that mixes the choppy Memento and the dark Batman Begins. Using darker colors, longer shots to portray emotion, and hints and clues throughout, Nolan is certainly the right man to tackle this story because of its non-linear course. He does a much better job here than in Batman Begins in terms of serving a gloomy atmosphere and dim tone. Also involved in the writing, the Nolan brothers did a good job hiding the secrets from the audience, but also stretched the plot a bit too long, when it could have easily been a much shorter film. Perhaps it was because they wanted to foreshadow the ending on multiple instances? Perhaps because providing more content would give the ending a bit more closure? Nonetheless, not everything seen in the first two acts was actually necessary.At least we have some fine acting to help move the story along. Hugh Jackman removes the claws and does a superb job as a broken, bitter magician whose better days left him after circumstances beyond his control. Michael Caine tops Jackman with his portrayal as the magician not taking sides in the entire case, even when loves are on the line. David Bowie and Scarlett Johansson were good, but a bit underused. Christian Bale on the other hand, didn't provide as much effort here as in previous performances like in Batman Begins, The Machinist, among others.Pacing of the movie is its ultimate strength and its ultimate weakness. In a non-linear film, moving too fast would be confusing and make the viewer more lost than a blind drunk man in a mirror maze. Once again, citing Pulp Fiction as an example, the modern masterpiece clocks in at over 140 minutes, is slow-paced, and yet remains astoundingly entertaining and fun because it is so rich in content and detail. The Prestige on the other hand doesn't quite dazzle and entertain the way Pulp Fiction, Memento, Fight Club, and other non-linear movies do. With a phenomenal amount of dialogue and little action, the true fun of the film comes within its mysteries, its questions raised.Yet exactly like what would happen if the television show Lost abruptly ended, The Prestige does not answer all the questions, even when the credits roll. As the film progresses and the plot becomes thicker and the tensions and stakes raises, a lot of details raise questions about the who, the where, the why, and especially the how. Nolan was good at teasing the audience and leaving the bait, but failed to go for the kill when he really should've. He did not wrap up the story in a nice bow, or in a fashion that would leave the average viewer fulfilled. The Illusionist followed a similar pattern of leaving clues to the grand finale, except the ending answered all that needed to be answer. With questions that could result in several different answers, each of them potentially changing major themes in the movie itself, answers were more than necessary here and it was not delivered.Bottom Line: The Prestige is a dark, twisting movie that doesn't seem to find its course, and while it keeps the audience in check, it leads to an abrupt dead end with many questions hanging around. The direction was great, the casting was wonderful, and the cinematography was outstanding, but something in the writing was lacking--seemed to be missing. Then, to make things a bit more disappointing comes the final act, which may leave some viewers pleased, but may leave others scratching their heads. If you want all answers revealed, you are in for a major disillusionment."
"Review of The Prestige : I approve of the way ""The Prestige"" engages viewers and makes them concentrate (there are too few such films lately), but it is too belabored for me. Cheats abound; for one, Fallon is never properly introduced as a character, and none of the characters displays any knowledge of the other except what is in the moment. Tesla himself would have laughed as he was aware of the law of conservation of matter and energy. The outcome is just wrong - both magicians should have ended up as the figurative ""Man in the Box"". It has some excellent moments and I like that it engaged the audience, but with its needlessly time-warped narrative, lack of characterization, and empty flash, it's something of a con."
"Review of The Prestige : There is a great big hole in the plot. Angier is obsessed with knowing what knot Borden used to tie his wife up just prior to her death. And Borden was haunted because he couldn't remember.The problem is her hands were STILL tied together when she was rescued from the tank. All Angier had to do was look! Either of them would have looked. Wouldn't you check that first if you suspected it was the wrong knot that caused her death?! Even if both of them were too distraught at the time (really??) you'd think Cutter would have taken note. Here, let me rewind the movie just a bit for you, guys....."
"Review of The Prestige : Unfortunately I noticed Fallon was Bordens' twin/look-a-like early on in the movie so that's one of the two plot twists ruined. And as someone else mentions, we literally see Tesla's 'cloning machine' works so it's obvious how that will pan out, with Angier(s clone) getting out alive & Borden (although it seems it's Fallon, aka the angrier twin) being hanged.
Another thing I did not appreciate was Scarlett's accent, and maybe it's because i'm a Londoner, but i found it jarring.
I appreciate there was more to this movie than the plot twists, it was beautifully shot and I personally enjoyed performances by the two main actors and by the late Bowie but yeah, their obsession came to be a little tiresome."
"Review of The Prestige : An interesting and correctly delivered film. But for me it's too long and boring. Good acting, Beautiful shooting, Costumes. If liked ""Inception"" you should like."
"Review of The Prestige : This movie took to long to get good. There were many times i was bored and confused. But I think being confused was apart of the experience of this movie. Like the viewer was supposed to be the one getting tricked which i get but knowing that until the end isn't the best. Both of the main characters weren't very likable either. I do believe this film is very overrated, but maybe im just missing something. I feel like i have to do extra research to understand this film because it was just everywhere, the time like was so crooked i couldn't get it straight. Not my cup of tea but I understand someone really enjoying this film."
"Review of The Prestige : I have to say, when I saw the trailers I was expecting... something more. Its NOWHERE near as thrilling as commercials will lead you to believe. The movie is 2 hours, which isn't a bad thing, except for the way the directors seemed to just stretch and stretch the storyline as far as it can possibly go. The story is somewhat hard to understand, because it will sort of flash from the past to the present and you sort of lose track if your not watching closely. I was expecting much more from this movie, so don't get your hopes up too high, especially if your expecting a non-stop thriller. Okay so overall a pretty decent movie, interesting storyline, but hard to understand a lot of the time unless your watching closely."
"Review of The Prestige : Christopher Nolan's films are usually intelligently plotted and artistically well-made. ""The Prestige,"" unfortunately, is quite a letdown. This is no ""Memento""; it's not even a ""Batman Begins.""What sinks the film are its two big secrets (don't worry, I'm not going to reveal them here). One of the secrets is so scientifically ludicrous as to inspire laughter rather than awe. The other is so hoary and shopworn that one can only groan. Yes, the hackneyed secret is threaded into the film with cleverness and skill, but as the old saying goes, you can't polish a turd.The acting and direction are fine throughout, but the underlying plot weaknesses keep the film firmly anchored to mediocrity.6/10. A big disappointment."
"Review of The Prestige : Man, what a great movie...until the last 5 minutes.""The Prestige"" is a film that makes even the most jaded non-believer stare in awe at feats of magic. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rivals in the aforementioned field, and develop an acid antagonism when Borden 'accidentally' allows Angier's wife to die suspended in a tank of water. Their vengeance soars on a level both personal and professional, with each vying for the other's popularity, women, and magical secrets. At the core of this is a trick of which no one knows the key--titled 'The Transported Man,' it entails Borden teleporting himself from one place to another; Angier meets up with eccentric electro-magician Tesla (David Bowie), who seems to hold the answer.Director Chrisopher Nolan, who surprised us with ""Memento"" and rejuvenated the ailing ""Batman"" franchise, gives us another worthy, highly entertaining film poised for greatness...until the last 5 minutes. In his remake of ""Insomnia,"" Nolan's characters became slavish victims to the plot, and the same happens at the end of ""The Prestige."" After bobbing and weaving in a multitude of directions and keeping us guessing AND fully invested in the characters, it betrays our trust completely and leaves us with the sour notion that everything that happened in the preceding 2 hours didn't matter all that much.In a movie that pushes the figurative and literal limits of trickery, it seems like a low-brow deception for Nolan to leave us with the last-minute twists that would be more at home in the ""Saw"" series. Bale, Michael Caine, and Jackman (giving his best performance yet) are so strong--and their dispositions so absorbing--that the ending feels like the sort of dishonest fraud we'd get from a Three-Card Monte dealer. Yes, despite the maddening contrivances, ""The Prestige""'s twists DO make sense--but I felt the characters deserved a more sincere, straight-faced coda.In ""Secret Window,"" Johnny Depp told us: ""The most important part is the ending...and this one is very good."" Too bad the same can't be said for ""The Prestige,"" a movie that is so passionately bound for greatness that its last-minute deceptions make the disappointment that much greater."
"Review of The Prestige : There are some fine performances in this movie, especially those by David Bowie and Michael Caine. It has a good plot (somewhat spoiled by the confusing flashback-within-a-flashback direction) and some good character studies. But the whole house of cards falls down when the story introduces the ludicrous notion that Tesla invented a machine that could replicate an entire human being -- including clothes and memories? Apart from the fact that it's unbelievable, it causes two problems in the narrative. First, it introduces a deus ex machina, which the Subtle Fiction Writers' Workshop defines as a no-no. Worse, it changes the entire milieu of the movie in mid-stream. Up to that point, we are in the realm of Victorian magic -- no matter what appears to have happened, everything is governed by physical laws. Rather than find a good way for Angier to best Borden, the writers use the cheap narrative trick of allowing Angier to simply step outside the laws of physics.Since the ending of the film depends on rather clumsy narrative sleight-of-hand, it's hard to swallow...and thus hard to rate this movie as great, instead of just good."
Review of The Prestige : The storyline is very tricky and you have to pay some attention here. It is a thriller from another view of dimension. I didn't see many of those films that have to do with illusions. My wife didn't like it because the time is set in the last century but I don't mind. So we had at the end of the movie mixed emotions and opinions. She gave a 3/10 and me a solid 7/10. I never got bored because the pace was rather fast and there were finally many surprisingly scenes till the end when I was impressed solving the enigmas. All the cast delivered a respectable performance and the director was very good after his disappointing Memento. I think for all these reasons the audience gets a very interesting show. Final vote is a solid 5/10. I am curious how will do the other THE ILLUSIONIST.
"Review of The Prestige : When I first watched this movie, I thought it was brilliant. It's well acted, and the plot's pretty good. HOWEVER, then I found the novel by Christopher Priest in a second hand book shop. I've only recently finished reading the novel ""The Prestige"", and I have to say, the plot of the novel is so much better than the plot of the movie. After reading it, I've begun to wonder whether the Nolan's actually FINISHED reading it before they adapted it into a movie, since the plot of the movie is missing the most major plot point, which becomes obvious at the ending of the novel. To everyone who has complained about the use of Tesla's machine in the movie; READ THE BOOK, it's purpose is pivotal to the ending of the novel; a part of the plot which isn't even used in the movie!!! So, as a stand alone film, I would give Nolan's ""The Prestige"" 8/10, but Christopher Priest's novel deserves 10/10, and the fact that the movie neglects main parts of the novel for me pulls down it's rating as an adaptation by a lot..."
"Review of The Prestige : So in a fit of Daniel Craig-inspired self-loathing, I spent a few hours down the gym on Saturday. Now my normal Daniel Craig-esque physique is restored. Phew. But since my wife wanted me out the house for a while more - she works hard, she does, and I'm somewhat distracting, thanks to my aforementioned Daniel Craig-esque physique - I went to see The Prestige, a tale of two Victorian conjurors trying to kill each other.The trouble with The Prestige is that it revolves around a single magic trick, done in three different ways. If you can guess two of them, it's not a great movie but it's still very interesting and fun; if you can't, you'll feel cheated when you hear how they're done, but it'll have been worth watching."
Review of The Prestige : Its an interesting movie to watch! A lot of magic involved. Ummmmm its good its good I dont know I dont have much comments about it. Just not like it doesnt have a very big plot twist uhh idk most of the time its just like a lot of rivalry... yeahhhh i am sorry im kind of sleepy idk what to write. Byebye!
"Review of The Prestige : First I just want to preface by saying this is my opinion, if you don't agree with it just ignore it. My girlfriend loves this movie so I decided to give it a shot, after watching it I was disappointed. The cinematography was great and the acting was beautiful. The plot was not my favorite, I honestly got quite bored until the ending. There were lots of time skips that make you confused as to what's happening. I wouldn't say it was a waste of time but I definitely would've been fine not watching it."
"Review of The Prestige : (2006) The Prestige
THRILLER/ MYSTERY DRAMAAdapted from the novel by Christopher Priest, co-produced, co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan with Robert Angier (Hugh Jackson) a magician married to Julia (Piper Perabo) along with his assistant/ box jumper Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) has just moved to a new town, magic is the main attraction seeking for employment along with Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) they start off as apprentices/ proteges for Cutter (Michael Caine) until they compete with one another with a revelation toward the end. I thought the overall tone was too dark, grim and cared more for Robert and cared for the Christian Bale character even less."
"Review of The Prestige : Am I the only one who was turned off by the editing in this film? The Prestige certainly has an interesting story, and I was very much thrown into a loop by the ending, which had me mentally working through early clues and story points (as well as some few deeper implications).Yet I found the actual viewing experience rather nauseating at times. I actually felt compelled to turn off the film at multiple points of the runtime. Why? A combination of a few factors. Narratively, the film is overly dense yet feels shallow. So much is shown but not enough depth is established. Because of the fast pace, the characters start to feel more like tools of the plot than actual people; I don't think I felt a thing for any of them at any time. The editing also chops up the visual flow to such a point that there feels there's a lack of rhythm. We rush through shots and scenes and aren't even allowed to put our foot down into them. Add these up, and you feel like you are on a gondola that has been possessed by the spirit of a nauseating rollercoaster; thrown about here and there, you are hardly able to enjoy the view.Maybe I'm too harsh, and it could only be my experience, but I place high value on visual construction in films. If it's not given the space to breath, any intended thrill or depth in the story is completely diluted. Makes me wonder how much more power this film would have if it was directed by someone like Kubrick or Scorsese."
Review of The Prestige : Extremely overrated. Another waste of time. The cast may be good but the movie is not.
"Review of The Prestige : I found this movie to be ponderous with a bogus ending, deus ex machina. The redeeming grace is the acting by all which was very good. It was great to see David Bowie, as Tessla, in a film again. His trademark two different eye colors, unobscured by matching contact lenses, add to his character's dimension, and ""Smeegle"" is amusing as Tessla's assistant. The sets and settings were very good, but I'm a sucker for a well put together period piece. The construction of the tricks was interesting and I enjoyed the execution of them throughout the entire film. I don't understand how the viewer rating is so high on this one, it's very long I much preferred ""The Illusionist"", with it's superior pacing and plot line that was much easier to follow and a better payoff at the end."
"Review of The Prestige : I should have liked this film, but rather than being a heist-like film around magic, something really clever, it was ultimately something that cheats the audience.Really annoyed me."
"Review of The Prestige : The Director's trademark complexity and fanciful film gyrations are sometimes a bit too complicated, and in an era of many movies with shallow, silly, stories it's hard to argue that something is too cerebral. Intelligent, thought provoking, layered messaging is not really in vogue.But this too can be a deterrent when things get out of hand when the sleight of hand and misdirection is overdone to the point of viewer fatigue. The magical momentum that is at the heart of this film can be lost among the intrigue somewhat, and can leave the audience with a bit of an overwhelming experience. This, depending on your movie watching IQ, can be exhilarating or exhausting.After all, it is a very good film with style and deep twists and turns and is another in a string of surprises from one of today's best Directors."
"Review of The Prestige : I like magic tricks. Even as a kid I knew they weren't real, but it didn't stop me from admiring the skill and the how-did-they-do-that moment right after the prestige, the final act of a magic trick. It's a kind of awe. But the success of a magic trick is based on the audience not understanding how what just happened, happened. Every magician knows this, which is why they're wary to reveal how a trick is done.And that's the problem with The Prestige. The movie is about dueling magicians and is in itself a magic trick. There are twists, double-twists, surprise characters, we don't have all the pieces, or do we, no we don't, yes we do, another twist, and then the end happens -- and Christopher Nolan reveals how the whole narrative trick was constructed, step by step. It's as if a magician just did the most amazing trick you've ever seen and then spends the next ten minutes explaining how exactly he did it. It's disappointing, deflating. Instead of feeling wowed, we feel let down. We could talk about the other elements in the film, like the acting or directing or set design, but all these are subservient to the mystery, and in the end there is no mystery; had the ending been more ambiguous I would've rated this movie higher. I've seen every Nolan film, and this is the weakest by far."
"Review of The Prestige : I watch this movie yesterday and was disappointed. Not by the acting nor the way the movie is constructed (flashback), but by the ridiculous ending. The ""twin"" trick was quite interesting but not that surprising. But the ""cloning-machine"" trick was hilarious in a, until then, realistic movie. If, from the beginning, we would have known that we were in a fantastic type movie then it is acceptable. But the movie was presented as a true and realistic rivalry between two ambitious magicians. After the clone trick, I was expecting martians to come and save Borden's brother from being hang. It looks like the scenarist did not know how to finish its, already, very long scenario and had to find something incredible to fool the audience. ""... Whaa, he makes clones of himself with electricity in 1899..."". Tesla and Edison must roll themselves in their graves laughing."
"Review of The Prestige : Spoiler Alert - The Movie with a capital M looks, sounds & feels classic & real in that England late 1890s kinda way. Killer cast - Bale, Jackman, Johanssen, Caine etc...The cinematography, the acting, top notch. So what's the problem? The problem is that this serious, 'artistic' movie about antagonistic magicians hinges at the end on a Cloning Machine created by Nicola Tesla in Colorado & shipped over to London somehow & the other character is actually Twins!!! Lol, that's alot to swallow in the last 5 minutes that undoes much of the good value of the previous 2 hours...But judging by all the 10s given & cheers for Nolan as a director, I guess most people overlook those small factoids, lol...I'd like to but can't, thus a 5 rating..."
"Review of The Prestige : Methinks Christopher Nolan is letting his personal style get in the way of a good story. Nolan is a very good director, and a good writer on top of that, yet it seems that he has become overly-reliant on his signature use of chronology to make a movie. There are also far too many scenes in which the actors whisper or speak in hushed voices, a device that leads to lost dialog if you're in a packed theater or in a theater that has an incompetent sound system operator.The Prestige is a wonderfully unusual story about the rivalry and deadly history of two magicians at the turn of the century. Entertainment venues were very limited in that era so the attainment of star status was not only lucrative and coveted, it bestowed a good deal of social acceptance when class divisions were well marked. The tension of this rivalry against this backdrop is good fodder for a film, and teamed with complex personalities all around, romance, secrets, a criminal trial, and the dawn of new technological advances should have made a movie of grand entertainment. But, for me, all the suspense was drained and the drama diluted by Nolan's flashback, flash forward technique. Suspense requires time and pacing, a hum that builds slowly to a crescendo that gives you goose bumps or, at the least, makes you feel the hair on your arms. The potential was there, but Nolan interrupted the ascent too many times to gather momentum. Just as I was feeling the gnawing obsession of Angier, I was bumped to a vignette that re-adjusted my focus. And when I became involved with Borden's life, I got bumped to Thomas Edison. Nolan would not allow me to become completely invested in his characters because he simply didn't give me enough quality time with them despite their continuous presence on-screen. There is also one large plot hole that disrupts a major theme of the story.The Prestige has a nearly perfect cast. At this point in his career, Michael Caine has become so ubiquitous that, to me, he is always Michael Caine, a competent actor who overshadows his characters with his familiarity. He should think about changing his accent and/or his hair color if he continues to hire on so frequently. Bale, Jackman, and Bowie are quite the opposite, playing characters new to their resumes and doing so exquisitely. I've come to expect great performances from Bale and Jackman, but Bowie startled me with his acting chops. Scarlet Johanssen, not a favorite of mine as she has been a bland and flat canvas to date, actually shows some dimension in her supporting role.A nicely done drama in which the sum is far less than many of its superior parts."
"Review of The Prestige : ***READ THIS ONLY IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM***When compared to the other magicians movie that came out the same time, The Illusionist, this movie is just slightly better. I saw a lot of the twists because they were hinted at throughout the movie. For instance, I figured that Borden had a twin or someone who looked like him because that's what Angier had. It wasn't until about 3/4 of the way into the movie that I started thinking about a twin brother. The twist about Angier's machine was pretty clearly put out there early on when you saw field with the Cats and the Hats. Why Tesla's assistant never saw the hats out there isn't really explained. You're just to assume that Angier made the discovery first. I'll have to re-watch the film, but as far as I could tell, it was Cutter who was setting up the tricks for Angier's final shows. At least, that's what it sounded like in the courtroom setting when he accused Borden/Fallon (we don't know who's really on trial) of moving the water tank under the trap door. But isn't it odd that nobody for all those performances never noticed the tank there every performance? Not even Cutter? Heck, even those blind assistants would have heard the thrashing about in the tank as the Angier originals were drowned. And that brings me up to the murder scene. How is it that every performance, Angier drowns his original, then appears on the balcony to the crowd, but then they don't show it when Borden discovers the secret?!! Shouldn't the clone have materialized on the balcony? Even if he did suspect Borden was dressed as one of the people inspecting the machine, he wouldn't have had time to recalibrate it to shoot his clone far away and out of sight. And lastly, why go through the trouble of getting a new tank full of water every day and storing it in a basement where people could find it? If Angier was dead, you'd think Cutter would have gone to that burned out theater, looked in the basement and saw all those tanks full of clones. I mean, they were supposedly selling off Angier's belongings. As for the bodies, it would have been more practical to just take the body out and dump it somewhere far away, instead of coming up with a new water tank for every performance. That place would have reeked after a couple of days. So the movie was great to watch and I was captivated by how the whole thing was unfolding just to see if what I was anticipating was true. Sadly, when you really think about all the twists and turns that are what supposedly made this film great, the whole thing just falls apart. Otherwise, I would have given it an 8/10. But I'm giving it a pass because of the great acting."
"Review of The Prestige : I did not get the end of the movie. If the end is not understandable , then the Director must have got lost himself and did not know how to end the movie. The name of the movie should have been Obsession. Where does the question of PRESTIGE come up in the movie ?? 2 obsessed guys , trying to outwit the other & dont mind killing also. I gave 5 just for the acting of the stars. Story is average."
"Review of The Prestige : Adapting the novel which ""The Prestige"" was based on was no easy feat. The film's scenarists, brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wisely jettisoned the subplot from the novel set in the present time which chronicled the machinations of the descendants of the two principal characters. The Nolans also should be congratulated for turning the novel (which features separate diaries of the principal characters written in the first person) into a more coherent third person narrative. Some of the first person diary narration is retained in a series of voice overs but it's not overdone thus preserving the flavor of the novel.'The Prestige' concerns the running battle between the two well known stage magicians in turn of the century Victorian England, Borden and Angier. In the novel, Borden, a total stranger, initiates the conflict by attempting to expose his rival as a charlatan while Angier moonlights as a medium. In the film, Borden and Angier already know each other while working as apprentice magicians. The Nolans seek to create a stronger motivation for the conflict between the two. They introduce Angier as already being married. Borden is warned by Cutter (the engineer/impresario played by Michael Caine) not to use a certain knot because it's too dangerous when tying Angier's wife's hands during a magic trick. Borden ignores Cutter's advice and as a result of his pig-headedness, Angier's wife drowns when she is unable to untie the knot after being placed underwater in a glass booth. Visually it's a stunning scene but not all that convincing. Borden is depicted as being almost monstrous in the way he crassly ignores all safety procedures; what's more, others take no concrete action during the performance to prevent the mishap from occurring.Borden's pettiness is matched by Angier later on when he seeks to sabotage a series of Borden's stage acts. As the story develops, Angier shows up in a disguise at Borden's performances on more than one occasion. At one point he rigs a pistol causing it to misfire, which seriously injures Borden's hand. Soon afterward, Borden introduces a new stage act, ""The Transported Man"", where he steps into one door and then amazingly steps out of another door on the other side of the stage almost instantaneously. We later learn that Borden's assistant is actually his twin brother and the two have been working together to fool the public into believing that 'The Transported Man' is not an illusion.Angier ends up hiring a look-a-like so he can duplicate Borden's act. For a time it works, but his double is a drunkard who ends up blackmailing him for more money. Angier wants to know the secret to Borden's act, so he enlists his assistant, Olivia, to steal Borden's diary. When he gets his hands on the diary, he realizes he is unable to decode it, so with the help of Cutter, he kidnaps Borden's assistant and holds him for ransom. In exchange for his assistant (who is actually his twin brother), Borden gives him the 'key word' to decode the diary: ""Tesla"".Tesla of course is a real character in history who was Edison's rival in the early development of electricity. Borden had met Tesla earlier and employs electrical sparks from Tesla's 'alternating current' generator in his act. Angier goes to Colorado to meet Tesla and offers to buy his generator which he believes can transport matter. As it turns out (and this undermines the film's entire plot), the machine doesn't transport people but actually clones them. Angier goes back to London and every time he uses Tesla's device, a new Angier appears. After each act, ludicrously, Angier is forced to murder each newly created double (and stores the corpses in tanks underneath the stage).The Prestige has a subplot involving Borden's wife. Sarah, who is unaware of the existence of his twin brother. She learns of Olivia but doesn't understand that its Borden's twin brother who is having the affair with her. Ultimately she commits suicide.The film's scenarists introduce a new twist in the story's climax different than the novel: Borden ends up murdering Angier by placing an open water-filled glass booth under a trapdoor during one of Angier's performances. Borden is arrested and found guilty at trial of the murder. After Borden is executed, Borden #2 shows up and murders Angier #2. We learn that the man executed was actually Borden's twin brother and the Angier who ended up drowning was actually one of Angier's clones. Borden returns to his daughter and in classic Citizen Kane 'Rosebud' style, Angier's nefarious plan is revealed to the audience. As Tesla's machine along with Angier's 'glass tanks' go up in flames beneath the stage, we can see inside one of them: it's one of the 100 Angier clones, still preserved and evidence of the failed career of a monomaniac. 'The Prestige' must get high marks for art design. The costumes and sets make you feel like you're right there in turn of the century Victorian England. Generally the actors acquit themselves well especially Michael Caine as Cutter (a very minor part in the novel). Christian Bale is convincing as Borden but Hugh Jackman's Angier is ordinary. Surprisingly, David Bowie does quite well as the enigmatic Tesla. The women are not developed at all in the novel and unfortunately nothing much is done with them here in the film.The principal characters' obsession in attempting to undermine one another takes on a one-note quality thus exposing the characters as one-dimensional. In addition, once the plot veers off into science fiction/fantasy where people are cloned in a blink of an eye, the best one can say about the film is that it would be more fitting as a third-rate Twilight Zone episode. Nonetheless, 'The Prestige' still manages to hold one's interest as it is 'different' and wins points for mood and atmosphere, providing a glimpse into the rarely looked at world of magic during the Victorian era."
"Review of The Prestige : When I watched The Prestige with my friend and some of his siblings and friends, I partly fell asleep during some of the passages so I'm not sure if I got the gist of the plot. But I did understand that it went back and forth in time and I understood most of what happened, I'm just not sure if it was compelling enough to really care about what happens during the whole thing. Now Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were fine as were Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie in a small role. Maybe if I were to watch again with a more alert eye I'd give this one a better rating but for now I'm giving this one a 5."
"Review of The Prestige : My spoiler will come at the end. As stated this was a gorgeous movie, the period details and shots were lovely, worth at least 9/10 stars. The acting was high caliber and The Prestige (unlike the Illusionist) took some time with the magic and its procedure and performance (the technology and the showmanship, I love them both about ""magic""), which was what I looked forward to in each movie. The plot of competition, obsession and sacrifice was above average, which is more than I expected, so I was set to love it all. But because I loved it one of the twists (a single, ridiculous twist!) ruined the whole plot. The spoiler:The Prestige spends quite a bit of time explaining or teaching the science and technology behind the magic, and it dares to use a Victorian electric replicating machine! I would have preferred actual magic to fake science. Even fake science would have been fine, a vacuum tube or something, but truly fantastic science?! Star Trek could get away with it because it was set hundreds of years in the future, who knows what will happen, who cares, it's entertainment. This was just so wrong it stayed on my mind and ruined the finale. It's still bothering me today, and I've waited to be objective before I voted and commented."
"Review of The Prestige : If this were some re-make or slasher I would expect nothing . It is an original idea with a fine cast and wonderful sets and settings .Maybe the idea is too original ( maybe not ) . I don't want to give much away . I should have loved this movie ; I love magic ; Hugh Jackman is very David Copperfieldish (look and everything) this is a good thing to me ; I love Michael Caine his accomplishments are too numerous to even begin to mention except to say see the original ""Italian Job"" . This does have some interesting historical tidbits which may spark interest . There is I believe a moral to the story which may in the end be a redeeming characteristic ; but it is disjointed and feels that way . I could not recommend people spend their time or money on it ."
"Review of The Prestige : A couple of magicians develop a heated rivalry around the start of the 20th century in London. Nolan has a nice visual flair but can't elicit good performances from his big-name cast. The acting of Jackman and Bale, the latter sporting a bad English accent, may be kindly described as average. Caine fares better, although he seems to be still playing Batman's butler. Johansson is wasted in a negligible role. The script is so contrived, muddled, disjointed, and utterly ridiculous, and the characters are so poorly developed, that one doesn't care who wins the rivalry. It's a dull and long-winded story with an unsatisfying conclusion."
"Review of The Prestige : I didn't remember who was the director of The Prestige when I finally decided to watch it. So this is not a matter of prejudice, but when the credits eventually rolled I was relieved both because I found it overlong and protracted and because I was now definitely able to put a word on why I don't like Christopher Nolan as a director.Let me start at the beginning. I just start to watch The Prestige as an honest viewer. I am not that found of magic shows but this sounded like a nice story. Actually I remember it's IMDb ranking and the presence of Michael Caine who put the movie on my backlog of recent flicks I might enjoy. Early on the storyline fluctuates between various times: past, past-perfect, present. It's OK, but it really doesn't help the movie build up ""emotional momentum"". The story never trusts continuity so we are demanded to always switch our attention on episodes that explain the whole story one anecdote at a time.PLOT OBSESSION Most viewers seem to like this very authoritative way of telling the story. They are told what to watch, what to understand little by little and it's all about the plot, the plot, the plot. Characters are mere props. In the Prestige I realised Hugh Jackman is only an average actor. I agree the part is not the greatest but he really doesn't shine. As for Christian Bale I already knew he was a big ham who thinks he's good, dead serious while trying too hard to display his actor's studio abilities. Both actors are boring at best in the course of this story, and Christian Bale as the most boring part of all.Well it's a fact that the lead illusionists are mean and inhuman characters. The chopped up narration only makes it more about their sick minds than their wounded souls. Fortunately there are a few nice characters here. Michael Caine adds humanity and presence to a simple part, and the feminine characters also help the movie rises up from its plot obsession. The production values help too, when the nicest characters aren't there.Christopher Nolan is only too happy to have his plot tick like a clockwork, but eventually he is only a trick director in the same way as Agatha Christie was a trick writer. Characters don't matter, they're here to do the trick. Memento was a one-trick movie. Batman begins and The Prestige are very similar with their trick-filled characters immobile while the whole movie revolves around them in a big spinning trick. And Inception is a trick in a trick in a trick. Characters start as tricksters and they soon vanish behind the tricks layer.To me that is the opposite of cinema: the trick is the show while it should be the illusion that it creates. Weird since this is the main lesson, clearly enunciated, in The Prestige: ""There is nothing more disenchanting to man than to be shown the springs and mechanism of any art."" (R. L. Stevenson)"
"Review of The Prestige : The word ""discombobulated"" comes to mind. I missed a lot of the dialog either thru deafness or the English dialects (or both); there were one (or more) too many flashbacks; but more importantly there were so many plot twists, I suspect that if there are any holes in the plot (which wouldn't surprise me) no one would be able to detect them unless they had a copy of the film and jotted down each fact (or illusion) as it transpires. No fair checking Christopher Priest's novel or the Nolan brother's(?) screenplay. At the end of the film, you ought to at least know how many Borden's and how many Angier's there were (are). And how many died (if any). If someone produces a film with more plot twists than ""Prestige"", will that make it a better film? Overkill! No thank you."
"Review of The Prestige : This movie is not bad. This movie is not good. The costumes are great, the movie stars beautiful (it was worth $5 for a matinée glimpse of Jackman without his shirt on), the acting superb (I mean..Michael Caine; it doesn't get any better than that).But the plot is convoluted and hard to follow. It jumps back and forth, with the audience finding themselves trying to place whether this is in the past, the present, or the future. It also assumes the audience will relate to an obsession of the sort detailed in this movie. I didn't.The movie was interesting, well worth the reduced matinée price of a movie, and the actors rose to their peak levels for a movie of this sort. But ultimately, it seemed to me that a group of suits sat around a table, made a list of some movie star names, and said, ""What movie can we create to have all these guys in the same movie and really pack the audience in?"" They ended up with a movie created for these performers, rather than a great movie, the cast for which was pulled from a list of excellent actors.How it would have been better: A better script, tighter, shorter, a bit less convoluted. Photography - there were far too many extreme closeup shots. It would have been better if they had made some of those extreme closeups more full body or upper body shots, so that the audience could see the body language and maybe the other person the actor was communicating with. Not that there weren't great extreme closeups. And not that I mind seeing Hugh Jackman's eyes in closeup. It's just that there were too many such shots.I expected more from Bale, Jackman, and Caine. Like I said, it was good, not bad. But I would've thought that these three powerweights of Hollywood could have commanded an excellent script and an award winning movie. They didn't hit it with this one."
"Review of The Prestige : In a film about magic and illusion, isn't it a shame that the makers cheat the audience who have waited patiently for the clever reveal. It's not so much a case of ""how did they do that, it's impossible"" as ""that IS impossible"". There's no magic trick at all, the whole conceit relies on a sci-fi teleporter/cloning machine which does not and never has existed. Well acted, well staged and filmed but the whole idea of the magic trick ending with a ""prestige"" is lost because, in this film, the trick has no prestige, just a sparkly device which, you feel, has been invented by the film-makers because they couldn't think up a clever ending. Twists and tricks are great in movies, provided they are believable and inventive. Doing the impossible is merely treating the audience as idiots."
"Review of The Prestige : I love a film that doesn't spoonfeed the plot and the story and the interest in it to the audience. This one takes you along if you are smart enough to go and if you are not so dumbed down by most entertainment that you can stay steadily involved.I wanted to love it to death...it has everything I think a film should have, including a wonderfully rich atmosphere, a great cast and excellent direction. Through most of it, it dares the audience to be intelligent and to have an attention span longer than a fruit fly. It had all the makings of a great film, but I kept looking for (and longing for) the greatness to impact me. It never did.It fell flat for me by the end. I really didn't care about any of them by then. I wasn't even sure I cared about the little girl. I certainly didn't care how anyone did any of the illusions; I was sick to death of their obsession with each other and just wanted them to move on already. Although there would be no film without it, it all seemed to be 'too much trouble to go through' and obsession is about getting caught up in it...for me, I couldn't get caught up in itnor could I quite get their obsession. Although Iam a big fan of the long, thinking person's film, I have to say I thought it dragged on and on by the end and I just wanted it over. It definitely did not leave me wanting more. I just wanted different.I had paid attention all along, I was impressed with the film and thought the acting, the cinematography and the direction were all superb. Even though some of the twists seem unnecessary, I thought many were brilliant and I kept trying to will myself to care about it, to care about them, but I didn't.It was a very good film in a detached sort of ""viewing art"" way but as far as feeling ""wow""'d by the end, not so much."
"Review of The Prestige : Sorry, but I guess I'm going against the grain on this one. I remember when Michael O'Donoghue was writing for National Lampoon; he had a ""how to write a short story"" article. The thrust of the piece was -- if you get bored or can't figure out an ending, have your character get hit by a bus. This movie seems to take that approach.The 'miracle' invention that Tesla apparently provided Hugh Jackman's character, which allowed him to duplicate himself, is nowhere referenced in the movie. The ending is a cinematic equivalent of ""then he got hit by a bus"". In short, I think the audience was cheated. Apparently most of the people who commented on this movie didn't mind that, but I thought it lacked integrity.Beautiful cinematography, tortured accents, and a conceit that's actual a deceit. Not recommended."
"Review of The Prestige : ...but it fell like a card-house. I really like the thought of the ""its all about the sacrifices you make"" plot but it just doesn't last. Up until Nikola Tesla did his cloning/teleport thingey I still had some hopes for the movie and I sat hoping that Tesla had faked the cloning just to get some more money when i saw the hats and cats on the ground. I genuinely hoped the filmmakers illustrated Tesla as a hoax, it sure seemed better than the movie getting all Star Trek! Unfortenately the writers didn't pick up that extra ace from their sleeves and the movie literally flat-lined and just died. Beam me up Scotty :("
"Review of The Prestige : A film about illusion and trickery needs to be resolved with illusion and trickery... not with sci-fi.The fact that Angiers couldn't just ask Cutter to look and identify what type of knot Borden/Fallon had tied should have been warning that we shouldn't buy into this film.... and the big wait for a non-cheating, sensical twist was not rewarded."
"Review of The Prestige : A very entertaining movie. And as it unfolded I was looking forward to the ""twist"" at the end, I realized that Borden had a twin. A good twist to be sure. Maybe Angier having a twin would have been a cool twist! But it disappointed me at the end. The movie betrayed it's own reality. There is no such thing as ""real"" magic! There is always a trick to it! The machine worked?!!! For the machine to actually transport and duplicate was very cool, but it was a cheap betrayal of the plot's own premise! Don't spend an entire movie grounding me in reality and then insert fantasy. I would have accepted a scam, y'know the hats and cats and all. The machine worked?!!! C'mon! Folks, they pulled the ending out of their ass. It was not a twist. It was ""magic"", and that's lazy movie making that insults the viewer's intelligence!"
"Review of The Prestige : A film about magicians, and of course magicians make a business tricking people. Usually, though, the audience doesn't figure out the trick, and that's why it works. Unfortunately here the trick is laid bare and it makes the whole thoroughly disappointing. There is much more promised than delivered, and I find it hard to recommend to anyone. Part of the disappointment is that it could have been so much more. The premise is interesting, the characters start out interesting... as is, though, it needs a major rewrite. Sorry."
"Review of The Prestige : I'm going to go ahead and tell you right now that you wouldn't be missing all that much if you didn't see this movie. It tries to pass itself as historical fiction, pertaining to a time period in which magicians were willing to do anything to usurp their fellow illusionists, but at the end it dabbles much too far into the realm of impossibility-explained-with-science that it effectively ruins itself and drops down to the uninteresting ""sci-fi"" category.For about the first two hours, it was what I expected. A dark, mysterious, captivating, and twisted piece of storytelling. I've come to associate each of those elements with director Christopher Nolan and his oddly familiar castChristian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cane, and Scarlett Johansson. But at some point during the course of the above-average directing and acting, the writer messed up. I don't want to give away too much, but it effectively ruins the greatest magic trickthe Transported Manfrom the movie. It became convoluted. It tried so hard to be darker, more mysterious, more captivating, and more twisted, that it eventually turned itself into a pretzel. A crap covered one.The final scenes made an attempt to fix up the original mess by delivering a punch that was actually thought-provoking. Still, you could pass this one up until it comes out on PPV or Blockbuster. Don't pay full price, unless you're a big ""Batman Begins"" fan and need something to satisfy your taste buds until ""The Dark Knight"" is released in 2008."
"Review of The Prestige : Maybe it has to do with the fact that I didn't like much Memento or Batman begins ( following was quite nice though) but seeing the name Christopher Nolan made me doubt to watch the movie. But of course , as a die hard film fan, I did and again I was left unsatisfied. Positive : actors : Hugh Jackman / Christian Bale, inside look in some (the ""gruesome"" birdcage)magic tricksNegative :long dreaded, not particularly amusing, not much character deepening, story.Overall : At a certain moment i just wanted the movie to end. And I don't have that often. Probably you have to be a Nolan fan. If you are not don't bother watching this film"
"Review of The Prestige : I don't care about the people in this movie, nor about any romance or struggles they were involved in.And if I say to hell with the characters--the message is the point; that's even worse. The message is neither inspiring, nor enough of an opposite of inspiring to give the stimulating, titillating gift of darkness.I really went in wanting to like it, and wanting to care about what was going on (and I really like almost all of these actors). And I'm normally not too good at guessing endings and so on... Wow. Not one single surprise that you weren't at least suspecting far in advance. Sometimes, it just boggled the mind; when something was introduced as a surprise, I was sitting there thinking, ""Um, didn't they explicitly reveal this an hour ago?"" Maybe I'm just missing the point that it's really for twelve-year-old girls or something.Yes, that must be it.I really feel robbed. Sometimes after a movie, there's that afterglow that just fills you up. Sometimes, it's so sad and moving that you can think about it five days later and still work up a tear. Sometimes, it's that it's so fun to think about it, over and over the details... In this case, what I'm left with is wanting to kick someone. It's the feeling of sorta wanting to kick myself, but the 8.5-star rating that's currently the average on IMDb excuses my mistake.The movie makes you feel like a sucker, and gives you almost nothing in return.It was mildly pretty, but... I'm still waiting for the prestige, here."
"Review of The Prestige : I'd been excited about seeing THE PRESTIGE, especially as it re-teamed two of my favourite film people from BATMAN BEGINS: the usually excellent Christopher Nolan, who delivered the excellent INSOMNIA and MEMENTO, and Christian Bale, an actor who can do no wrong in my eyes. Then what a shame it is that THE PRESTIGE turns out to be nothing more than a silly, muddled science fiction film masquerading as a serious and engaging drama.It starts off on a strong footing, with interesting characters and situations, but quickly loses these in a stupid plot that jumps all over the place and never bothers making much sense. The biggest kick in the teeth, however, is the ending, which ties things up with two plot twists that are frankly awful. The first is a sci-fi staple – cloning. What place does it have in a supposedly realistic Victorian thriller? It just turns this film into a fantasy and loses audience interest. The second twist is the one that's apparent early on, and one of the classic 'tricks' much beloved by writers of murder mysteries and crime thrillers. It's also been done to death and was outdated about a century ago, but no, it's resurrected here and had me groaning, feeling cheated when it appeared.THE PRESTIGE isn't a totally bad film and there are quite a few things to recommend it. It looks fantastic, and all of the electric special effects are tremendous. It also boasts a pretty good cast, with Christian Bale delivering another outlandish performance – his Cockney accent here is quite amusing – and Michael Caine presiding over things in his usual manner. Hugh Jackman I don't particularly like as an actor, and he's at best passable here; but in comparison to the hopeless Scarlett Johansson, who struggles with her British accent, he's Laurence Olivier! There are some fun minor roles for Andy Serkis and David Bowie, the latter playing the inventor Nikola Tesla and doing a good job of it. While the magic acts and tricks are engaging when they're on screen, it's just a shame that the film becomes so implausible and cops out towards the end. THE PRESTIGE contains nothing I'll want to sit through again."
"Review of The Prestige : Watched this via DVD...and the sound was poor, sometimes low and hard to hear, then normal..near the end the music seemed to be drowning out the conversations... I thought Michael Caine was good. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale do a credible job, but not stellar. David Bowie in a small role is good. The sets are incredible, and the snow scene with the lights is a wow...it would be nice to see such a light show in real-life during the Christmas Holidays. Still the movie is slow at times, and yet, still isn't too bad--not great, but acceptable. This isn't a great movie (far from it, OK, way from from it), and at 130 minutes does seem long. I thought the story was good, the dialogue passable---when it could be heard. I don't know if others have noticed this, but it did distract from the movie. Quality of sound should be standard, but in this one, I felt it really go to be annoying at times, as I had to constantly adjust the volume up, down, up,down.Movie plot wasn't bad and acting was decent..just poor sound production."
"Review of The Prestige : The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. In this particular case, the audience is shown nothing less than Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale displaying their magical acting and accompanied by a magic deck with cards so valuable as Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis and David Bowie. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. The magician goes by the name of Christopher Nolan, and his something extraordinary is the filming of this movie, which captivates from the very beginning: the settings, the pace, the staging, everything is managed in a way the audience will but get hooked. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before. True. But if what you never saw before comes to be some ""Deus ex machina"" sleight of hand, part of the audience shall feel cheated; and all the previous work, though highly remarkable, will end up being part of a trick that lacks ""the prestige""."
"Review of The Prestige : The writers tried to pack 10 pounds of story into a 5 pound bag. Combining the material for four clever stories into one did not work. Plot holes developed quickly and the audience was let down with weak points and bad cuts.Plot holes.1: There was no indication that Bale's character was doubled by a Tesla machine. It only showed him attending a hastily-sketched Tesla demonstration.2: The solution to the problem with Bales' lover and wife was a plothole: If he had an asbolute clone, would that clone not love the wife as much as the original? They _both_ loved the daughter equally.2a: If one clone did _not_ love the wife, why would he bother going to her? The clones could were already using disguises and living separate lives - they could have maintained separate loved ones as well.3: If the light bulbs needed no wires then why did the one Jackman picked up go out when he did? I know this has to do with Tesla's wireless electricity and that the bulb had been in a socket, but it's not presented coherently.4: The light bulb Jackman holds when being greeted by Tesla illuminates when Tesla holds his hand. Bodies conduct electricity, sure, but they don't generally store it too well.Weak points / bad cuts: 1: Throw-away inside joke: ""He's an out of work actor,"" speaking of the alcoholic.2: Cut from the birdcage falling on the woman's hands - Jackman was so unshaken that it made the accident unintentionally hilarious.3: The escalating violence between the magicians quickly became funny instead of tense. Audience can only sustain repeated shocks a few times before they respond with laughter.4: How many times does the three steps of a magician have to be repeated? The first time I heard it - it set a good mood. The second time - no problem, it must have something to do with the theme of the movie. Third, fourth, and fifth times - alright, give me a break.This movie had me for the first 20 minutes, but after 2 hours I almost walked out. I can only stand a butt-numb-athon if my interest is held. So much was crammed into so little time that the efforts of the actors was largely wasted. Potential is a movie's greatest enemy, and this movie's potential got the best of it by far. The costumes and set pieces and capture of the era was good. The inaccuracies concerning Tesla can be overlooked. But I have zero interest in enduring this film again. I would say it's Nolan's first failure thus far."
"Review of The Prestige : I have not read the book and so I suppose I should so I can give the story a fair shake. But the whole ""Tesla and His Miraculous Achievements"" aspect of the story, which is absolutely crucial to the plot, just turned me off like one of Tesla's bulbs.With all due respect to a great man, Tesla was largely a showman...just like Edison and many other inventors and scientists of his day. Self promotion was the rule and, given the opportunity, they would gladly explain (or imply) that they could power vehicles at great distances, create earthquakes, and perform similar miracles. The idea that Tesla either discovered some natural force or designed an elaborate machine (remember, while there were some primitive vacuum tubes in development prior to 1900, it was only after the turn of the century that they became practical for use in electronic circuits) to accomplish ""The Prestige"" is so bizarre that it basically doesn't even rise to the level of deus ex machina.So, as we say here in NC, the movie was ""fairly well ruin't"" for me at that point.I was also disappointed in the basic absence of any period magic or sleight of hand. There were a few examples here and there, just the minimum to try to establish credibility, but it was pretty tame and not at all of any interest.As far as the production and acting, that's the only reason it got as high a score from me as it did. Jackman was a so-so, Bale did OK (unfortunately, you really need to watch through to the end to appreciate his acting), and Bowie was a surprising, but good, choice as Tesla.Definitely not a DVD to purchase and I'm not sure that I would even rent it if I had known a bit more about it."
"Review of The Prestige : Coming from the director of 2 gripping movies in Memento and Batman begins,""The Prestige"" is a complete let-down.The story line is very thin and plot revealed at the end makes it look like a joke.It might precisely been his intention-to explain ow ludicrously simple magic tricks are-but then I wouldn't want to spending 2.5 hours of completely non-sensical attempts of sabotage(some of them had me in guffaws at the ridiculous stupidity of it all)only to find I was being taken for a ride all along. I can't help feeling he has tried to make a simple narrative needlessly complex trying to give psychological connotations to the entire story, and ""going back and forth in time"" stuff-which was completely unnecessary. Clearly he's suffering from ""Memento"" hangovers. At least,a genuine attempt at character development would have ensured that the magicians mind connected with the audience but sadly that was not to be.At times, I wondered if I was watching a comedy movie gone wrong or genuinely made to go wrong.Performances too are ordinary.Only thing that saves the movie are the few moments of good direction,good visuals and not to forget,the magic tricks that are demystified!"
"Review of The Prestige : The Prestige opens and closes with Michael Caine's stage engineer Cutter informing us of the three acts behind every magic trick. The pledge: setting up something that seems ordinary (a bird), the turn: making that thing do something extraordinary (the bird disappears), and the prestige: restoring that thing to reality (the bird reappears). The final of the three, which is meant to be the hardest to achieve, is the key to the trick working. It's eerie then that the film collapses within the most crucial area. Its own prestige. Nolan's film is effectively a game of showmanship between two rival magicians. How when one performs a trick that seems impossible, the other drives himself to the edge in order to figure out its secret. The film isn't really about magic. It's more about the magic in creating the perfect illusion. Yet it goes on to deal with heavier themes. Most notably the dangers of obsession. How our lead Robert Angier is frequently told that his obsession with his rival Alfred Borden will lead to grave consequences, and it eventually does. It's themes of obsession, guilt and deceit are so well handled that the film could have been about anything. The fact that both men happen to be magicians just adds to the overall mystique.The trick itself is known as the 'Transported Man' and involves Borden entering a door on one side of the stage and emerging immediately from a door on the other side. Angier is convinced that a double is being used, despite Cutter claiming that it isn't possible, and sets up someone to look just like him. Of course the act is a success, until Borden sabotages it and leaves Angier even more determined to work out the secret. This is a fantastic pledge that the story has created. It leads to Angier travelling to snowy Colorado in order to find electricity genius Nikola Tesla (a fictionalised take on the man, played by David Bowie) who he believes can help him.Both lead characters are strangely underwritten. It's understandable why the stern Borden and more flamboyant Angier would become rivals (and that's even without the death of Angier's wife to provide some forced conflict), but we know barely anything about them as individuals. Take away their obsessions and there is little below the surface. We need deeper insight to know what makes these men tick and in order to understand why they are taking such massive risks. It relies on actors with big screen presences to make the roles appear interesting, something that Bale and Jackman just about manage to accomplish.What balances this out is its excellent directing, cinematography and pacing. Nolan's use of place and atmosphere has always been one of his strong points. He breathes life into his representation of early 1900's London and of the darkness that is consuming his leads. This is also one of the most clinical uses of a time shifting narrative I have seen, nothing seems awkwardly placed or moved. Nolan's prowess is what guides us through the pledge, but can he complete the cycle and deliver the ultimate prestige? Well, is it possible for the payoff to totally derail a film? Yes, and here is the perfect example. The film constantly tells us to look at the smaller details, to 'look closer', that understanding the illusion is everything and that the cleverest ruse is what ultimately matters. It spends the entire run time telling us that magic isn't real or of any importance. But Angier's master trick can only be explained by magic. The audience has basically been deceived, in entirely the wrong way, by this 'twist'. The Sci-Fi elements that enter the fore in order to make the payoff work clash with everything, mainly because the film has been so heavily based in realism and real trickery. So what is it telling us? That everything that it talked about was a lie? It somehow manages to ruin its own prestige with such a convoluted and nonsensical twist.The films climax is almost nothing but twists and turns. Scenes revealing that nothing was ever as it seems and deception was constantly taking place. I'm a big fan of films that have twists that leave you in awe or amazed. But the twist here is so left-field and against the very principal of the story that it ends up effectively derailing entire sections of the film, making sequences illogical in every aspect. It saddens me, because I was extremely impressed by the film on a technical level. The story was intriguing and it felt as if it was building to the most impressive payoff it could. Instead, we're left confused and irritated as the film simply throws the rule book out the window for its climax and decides its own fate."
"Review of The Prestige : One might say that the best part of ""The Prestige"" is the ride to the theater. Those who say that are moronic. On the ride to the movie house you are mistakenly in the frame of mind that what you are about to see will be, in fact, entertaining and watchable. The best part of this film is the ride home for then the most arduous 2 hours spent in a theater in recent time are over. This film explains itself to you via Michael Cain's narrative of the three parts in a Magicians performance: at first an infant mewling and puking in his nurse....wait, thats something different. The First Act is called The Pledge, in which a magician displays an everyday object; act two is The Turn, in which that everyday object is made to do something extraordinary, such as disappear; and act three is The Prestige, in which the object reappears, dazzling an audience too afraid to applaud at the end of act two. The movie basically follows this pattern except The Prestige in this film is not dazzling at all, instead painfully obvious. Anyone who has seen the STTNG Episode ""Second Chances"" will not be in the least surprised. Those who haven't and have a brain in their head will not be. That said, my girlfriend and I were the only two people with brains in their head at the screening we attended. This auditorium was dazzled. People will come to see this film because all of the people involved are hot commodities right now. I suspect they will be disappointed."
"Review of The Prestige : I am a huge Hugh Jackman fan. And I love movies with intrigue, magic, supernatural. I am also a big fan of Christian Bale after Batman Begins.Having these two people in a movie and watching the incredible previews. I went to the movie expecting it to be FANTASTIC. Although the movie was composed fantastically and the actors were pretty good. The movie seemed too long and I kept waiting for it to end. I get that it was all about obsession but come on with great actors and an even greater director you expect a lot more. Micheal Caine was the saving grace. Also since I don't know much about magic it was interesting to see the kind of engineering and physics it requires. It was disappointing on the whole."
"Review of The Prestige : This movie wasn't something that I planned on reviewing before, but after my parents and I saw it I couldn't help myself. The wheels in my head turned like clockwork as I saw the film.To tell you the truth, the biggest reason behind why we saw ""The Prestige"" was because one of the trailers that came with it on Amazon Prime made it look so exciting! That, and the involvements of stars like Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johannsson, Michael Caine, David Bowie, and Andy Serkis got our interest hook, like, and sinker.To the surprise of my family and I, though...the film turned out to be an enormous disappointment! And that's even in stark contrast to the positive reception it received ever since its release in theaters.The only positives I managed to note were how impressive the performances of the cast were. I deeply admired that the performers were giving their all no matter what, and they fit their parts like a glove. The most enrapturing of the cast members were that of Michael Caine as John Cutter and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. Although I will admit that I can't help but wish that Bowie had a larger role and greater amount of screen time than what he was given.Other than that, the film just wasn't all that great.For instance, outside of John Cutter and Nikola Tesla, the characters were boring, unlikable, and unmemorable. Especially that of Robert Angier, Alfred Borden, and Olivia Wenscombe, who were played by Jackman, Bale, and Johansson. Several times, I noted that the three characters went through some development throughout the movie. But, the direction the film was ultimately taking Robert, Alfred, and Olivia in ultimately made their growth worthless and caused them to be all-the-more infuriating. It doesn't help that there was little to no sense of redemption from any of the three characters, because the rivalry between Robert and Alfred lasted until one magician went down and the other won.The overall direction by Christopher Nolan, and the screenplay by him and Jonathan Nolan, weren't my cup of tea either.As a whole, the film was openly befuddling and unexpectingly slow. It was frankly not as exciting as the trailer made it out to be, the trailer in question actually being quite misleading because it gave the impression that it was going to be about a regular magician facing off against another who was dabbling in dark magic. And because of how much of the focus was put on the petty rivalry between the two magicians, the narrative neither developed or took off. In addition to this, it felt like there was a vast potential that the movie just wasn't able to grasp, the potential in question being what my family and I were hoping the film would be based on the trailer. The ending was likewise very disappointing, because just when things were going to be heading in a likable path thanks to Robert finally seeming like he was realizing the errors he caused everything abruptly fell flat on its face thanks to Alfred killing Robert and him turning out to be alive. The themes of the movie were pretty much wasted, if I may add. The particular reason for why I'm saying this is because there were no morals for the characters to learn by in the long run. If the Nolan brothers really were trying to show that getting wrapped in your obsessions is truly a bad thing, they certainly didn't do a good job at getting that message across.In the end, aside from the performers showcasing phenomenal portrayals, the film as a whole was a waste at the most. It was confusing, slow, and it held no moral value either."
"Review of The Prestige : The movie's plot is about rival magicians ruining each other's lives. Because the director does a poor job with character development (humanizing them, an art Spielberg is the master of) I am left to not care about them personally nor their fates. When we paused the movie almost halfway thru our comment was ""so the movie is basically going to be a pissing match between two magicians. Got it.""Character development was sacrificed in order to fit in 5,000 twists and turns to get us to our climax in the end. The plot is too convoluted with science fiction and double-crossing.You could have removed Tesla's replicating machine from the movie, focused more on the commitment to create doubles or other less forms of ""mad science"" and spent more time developing the characters so that feelings like rage, jealousy and revenge would actually make sense to the audience. Jackman's wife dies but we don't feel his pain. We're just shown he's in pain (yet he's sleeping with Scarlet Johansson in no time). If his pain is not truly felt, how can I understand a burning psychotic obsession to ruin another man's life at all costs?The acting was very good so I give it a 4/10."
"Review of The Prestige : I personally don't agree that THE PRESTIGE will be one of the best films you have the chance to see. Visuals are stunning and you can tell that the director Christopher Nolan put a lot of labor into this project. Set at the turn-of-the-century London, magicians are celebrities and idols of the day. Two magicians, that have turned enemies deluxe, will passionately not stop at nothing to learn each other's majestic secrets. Each magician will apply deceit, sabotage and other dastardly deeds to become the greatest magician of all time. This movie is overly long and at times seems like it is just plodding along. Stars include: Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Piper Perabo, David Bowie and Christian Bale."
"Review of The Prestige : The Prestige has a lot of good things going for it. Great acting, a top-notch cast, interesting characters, beautiful scenery and gorgeous costumes. The film takes place in the late-Victorian period just as science is about to advance by leaps and bounds. Understanding, harnessing and manipulating electricity is the new and exciting craze. Add in two rivaling magicians who want to top each other's best act and the stage is set for what I hoped would be a gripping story. Piper Perabo was the most likable character and wish she had more screen time. There's also a sci/fi twist that is quite interesting too. All kinds of good things to make a great film.But...There are several ways that The Prestige didn't work for me. It has huge plot holes and continuity problems. Upon further analysis after the film, the logic was just plain sloppy. These issues should have been addressed and rewritten prior to filming. It really ruined the magic of the film.The pacing is uneven. Most of the time it's very slow (slower than Masterpiece Theater). If I had been watching the film on TV, I wouldn't have made it all the way through, but I was in the theater so it kept my attention span.The ending though interesting, was very disappointing. The film turned into a second-rate, M. Shymalan script for the last half hour. People in the theater were laughing after the end monologue because it sounded heavy-handed and ridiculous.Even though the actors did a good job, the range of each character was quite small. There was no depth. Jackman was obsessive, Caine was the all-knowing sage, Bowie was the mysterious scientist, Johansson was the slut, and all the rest. You get the idea. The lack of growth in the character development made the story boring and stale. I just didn't find myself caring for what happened to any of them by the end.The Prestige is actually a rather dark film. Much sadder and than I expected. It is not a feel good film. I would have been fine with the darkness if the plot didn't have so many holes in it. I usually enjoy a good mystery or thriller, but found the twists to be rather predictable.A quick warning for animal lovers: there's some animal cruelty. It's not as horrible as The Brothers Grimm, but it's something to be aware of if you are going to take a child to see the film or are sensitive about those things.If you aren't into analyzing films and don't care about it making sense, you'll probably enjoy the film. I was fine with the sci/fi aspect of The Prestige, it's the plot that has the problems. Some of the twists work and some are just silly and sloppy writing.I sincerely wanted to enjoy this film, but it wasn't as dazzling as I had hoped it would be. I wanted it to be a 10, but the most I can give it is 7."
"Review of The Prestige : Do not be alarmed, this does NOT contain spoilers. If you are, like me, a fan of the BBC series Jonathan Creek (detective series where the technical adviser to magician Adam Klaus teams up with a reporter to solve murders using the same method that is behind the magic shows. The adviser is named Jonathan Creek, hence the title) , you will probably think you have to see this movie, but you really don't. It relies on the same logic and tricks as all movies and series about ""magic"" do, although this one has a plot-twist, which by the way, you can see coming if you know how movies usually present such things. I figured the entire movie out in a quarter of an hour, although there remained some blanks in the picture, so I enjoyed the first 1 1/2 hour, but I have to warn you that this movie is cruel with many people getting hurt in many different ways and it is NOT a feel-good movie. Hugh Jackman is brilliant, though, reminded me of Thimothy Dalton (well he calls himself the Great Danton, coincidence? Yes.) And I would give Hugh my Hero of this movie vote, as I believe he is the guy you feel for. That is also why this movie sucks: you can pick either character to be your ""hero"", because well I get the feeling that the editor and director did not really realize you should pick one. This movie shifts between the two lead magicians as bad-guy and hero, which can be fun, but it is not. I left this movie feeling rotten and so did my party. They didn't all get it as fast as I did, so you may be amazed yet. But I'd pick a better movie if I were you, although pickings are slim at this time of year... Or: see this movie and leave half an hour early. Trust me, you'll feel better without it."
"Review of The Prestige : Having established his reputation with the tricksy, but effective thriller Memento, director Christopher Nolan and his screenwriter brother, Jonathan, return to the ""nothing is what it seems"" school of movie-making with their latest film, The Prestige. Unfortunately, this time the result can only be classed as a fraud.Focussing on Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), a pair of duelling Edwardian era magicians; for most of its overlong duration, The Prestige maintains the pretence that it is grounded in recognisable reality. Indeed at least one of the characters, the pioneering inventor Tesla (creepily played by David Bowie in one of the film's few highlights), was actually a real historical figure. Although the drama is steeped in illusion and trickery, the film lures its audience into thinking that all they are seeing is mere sleight of hand; tricks of the conjurer's trade, many of which are revealed in some detail.Yet when it comes to explaining the final baffling illusion, the Nolan brothers suddenly reveal the whole movie to be one big confidence trick. There is no ingenious explanation for Angier's climactic spectacle. It is in fact impossible; a cheat relying on an absurd sci-fi wheeze that renders the whole story completely meaningless.When Angier discovers all the cats and top hats out in the woods, my first thought was that Tesla was trying to con him into thinking he was being sold a cloning device, since obviously for it to be a REAL cloning device would just be too preposterous. But no, apparently not.Compounding the risible plot denouement, the film's dramatic and romantic elements also fail to engage. The love stories are underdeveloped, and end up hopelessly mangled by the disjointed, hop around all over the place, narrative structure. Only Rebecca Hall emerges well from these romantic subplots, managing to produce a convincing performance from the underwritten role of Borden's wife, Sarah. In contrast Scarlett Johansson just looks bored, as the glamorous assistant, Olivia. She appears to have faxed in her performance from the Hollywood hills. Her accent is a mess, and she seems to be relying upon her, admittedly ample, cleavage to do most of the acting.About all that pulls The Prestige up from a one or two star rating to a four, is impressive cinematography, and some excellent set designs and period detailing. Won't be enough to get me to watch it again, though."
"Review of The Prestige : Reading these drooling reviews, I have to wonder what has gone wrong with the movie-viewing community of late.This film is nothing more than a very expensive exercise in overstatement. How many times can we possibly hit our audience over the head with the same exact symbolism? How blatantly obvious can we make our ""elaborate plot twists"" by the end of the film? Hugh Jackman's closing speech is perfectly typical of this film. Shot and dying on the floor, he suddenly comes to this very drawn out and very boringly shot epiphany about how he was never REALLY obsessed with finding out his opponent's secrets. He actually traveled thousands of miles, spent countless amounts of money, (How did he have this, by the way?) shot, stalked, kidnapped, and did his very best to destroy his opponent's life, but he actually did it for ""the look on their (the audience) faces."" Please.And plot twists? No no no, my friends. There is precisely one plot twist, and it is given away by the ""tease"" at the beginning of the film. As soon as you see that the hat doesn't leave, you know the rest of the movie. Okay, it clones things. He makes new and kills one of himself every time. It's not a huge leap in logic, but the filmmakers see fit to treat the audience like a bunch of Neanderthal second graders.Finally, we are supposed to like the magician/twin that makes it back to his daughter in the end. Forgetting of course, the fact that he broke Hugh Jackman's legs, killed his wife, crushed that innocent woman's hand, and oh yes, shot and killed his rival. But he was justified, right? WRONG. Once again, Hollywood comes out with the kind of ambiguous, almost-moral movie that makes you just cringe with the pansy-butt quality of their statements.Please do both me and yourself a favor and skip this tripe."
"Review of The Prestige : Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is a very good looking movie and is very well acted. That having been said Chris Nolan plants so many winks toward the audience and little hints everywhere so that the ""not so average"" movie goer could see where it is leading one hour into the film. I did and so I am greatly disappointed.If ""The Prestige"" carries such an elaborate plot, with many twists and turns and a touch of sci-fi to it (no spoiler warning needed, it is mentioned in the commercial) then why make it simple for audiences to follow it? Movies like this carry great weight with terrific work and craftsmanship but for the second hour I sat in the theater knowing the end.This is not really a review, seeing that I don't need to review this film after hundreds have already done, but it is simply that if you follow the film properly (by listening to what the characters say without taking everything literally and by seeing everything that you are indeed seeing) its payoff will be quite sub-par.I compare this to ""The Illusionist"" because both films attempt to pull off a con on the audience. ""The Illusionist"" carries more grace, in its almost 1920's film-making style, and the plot is harder to figure out but overall it carries realism, which ""The Prestige"" does not (by a long shot).5/10 due to a terribly predictable story that is purposely woven in that fashion by Chris Nolan. If you want to see film that is airtight and what ill awe you, watch his film ""Following"".D."
"Review of The Prestige : Such a fuss has been made of this movie that I expected something out-of-the-box, and for anyone willing to believe the unbelievable it might even seem so. It's another example of how movie goers and makers have embraced the format of 'Style over Substance'. Everything about the story is so far-fetched and unbelievable that most of the time it's simply not worth even considering the outcomes. It's presented as if its fiction-fact, then swings into ridiculous science-fiction. IE; Human Cloning in the 1890's!If it weren't for some reasonably convincing performances from the leads, stylish art direction and production design, moody lighting and cinematography (except for some unsteady hand-held sections) this production would have fallen over in a heap. As it is, it holds its own based on stylish looks smothered in over-done smoke and mirrors camouflage. Many seem to go for this style and bluster but some will come away feeling cheated and taken for fools (and not in any sort of a good way), it doesn't do to think too much about this type of superficial writing. Characters are bleak and over-the-top nasty, not leaving much (if anything) to admire."
"Review of The Prestige : I totally agree with Berardinelli on this one. He sums the movie up marvelously when he describes it as: ""The Prestige is cold, and Nolan crafts a storyline that is more complicated than necessary"". And that is exactly the point, the film is so complicated it is almost impossible to follow, it doesn't make much sense, and is therefore not interesting for the viewer. It is also cold, without feelings, thus leaving the spectator indifferent to the proceedings or the final outcome.Subsequently, it doesn't matter any more that the movie is well crafted, in some instances well acted (especially Michael Caine), none of these things can change the viewers' overall sensation of disappointment in watching this film. On a last note, I do not believe the picture deserved any of the two nominations it received; just think about it, this film received a Nomination for best Cinematography and 'Curse of the Golden Flower' didn't...? I really fail to understand what they are thinking over at the Academy sometimes..."
"Review of The Prestige : There are many reviews on this site saying how after The Prestige they walked out of the theater in awe with jaws dropping. Personally, I didn't get it.The movie was a trick badly done. The ""turn"" is too transparent, revealing all the secrets to one that isn't simply waiting for the prestige. That is, by the middle of the movie, you can have a pretty good idea of how it will end. This would be fine if not for the fact that the ending is really all this movie is about. I suppose you might be able to enjoy it, if you're not that analytical and just take things as they are.Personally, I enjoyed The Illusionist much more, although that movie too had an all-too-obvious plot.Finally... as for those denouncing Tesla, rumors have circulated even until today about his experiments. The trick with the lightbulbs as seen in the preview? That was, and is, possible. Yes -- Tesla invented it. Tesla experimented with all kinds of things, including the technology seen in this movie. If anyone could have accomplished such a feat during that era, it would have been Tesla. This is a work of fiction so do take it with a grain of salt."
"Review of The Prestige : I was told by several people things like ""This movie is awesome!"" and ""you'll have to watch it like three times to figure out what happened!"" Well, I can pretty comfortably state that the movie is not ""awesome"" and it only took about 1/2 the movie to figure out what was going to happen. I'm not quite sure why such talent agreed to be in this film after reading the script, unless they figured that most Americans are dolts and wouldn't realize how inane this movie actually is (which apparently is true). If you do watch it, and I don't advise against it because it's a better alternative than a lot of other movies, don't be surprised if you come away shocked not at the ending but at the way it comes about. For in this movie, I'm not blown away by the twist but rather by the ludicrous yet horribly predictable road leading to it."
"Review of The Prestige : I am getting a bit annoyed with the IMDb ratings because they regularly trick me into watching bad movies which have inexplicably high scores.This movie is actually well packaged, technically competent, with good acting (except for the always wooden Jackman) and quite decent from a story-telling point of view. I was able to connect with the story and the characters despite their flaws and I was entertained for the first hour and a half.The process of getting behind the scenes and trying to understand/figure out all the subterfuges and tricks that these rival magicians use both in their acts and against each other was quite captivating and carried the movie well, the ultimate goal being to try to figure out ""the transported man"". Several of the twists caught me by surprise and I was waiting for a spectacular finale but then Nolan manages to drop the plot on the dung pile by unveiling... the Cloning Machine! The whole story becomes meaningless science fiction drivel. Why bring in a cloning machine when he could have borrowed a Transporter from the Star Trek set filming next door and wouldn't have needed to kill all those clones? And think of how all the other magic acts in the movie could have been enhanced with a Gravity Inverter, a Matter Replicator, Invisibility Cloak...Once the story credibility falls apart the nice packaging becomes an empty shell and it can't save the movie from demise. Too bad, it seemed to have great potential... Is Nolan becoming the next M Night Shyamalan?"
"Review of The Prestige : Okay, well I'd been looking forward to this movie, the premise sounded great, Victorian magician's competing with each other for the 'trick they'll be remembered for'... I've got time for the entire cast, and in my opinion they pretty much all turned in great performances... but i'm still a little unsure of how worthwhile this movie really is.*spoilers*so, the movie seems to centre itself around a clever trick 'The Transported Man' - which, although at points is described as nothing more than an illusion created with a magicians double, it's also suggested that Nikola Tesla invented a machine that would not just duplicate objects.. but would perfectly duplicate PEOPLE?!okay, i'm of two opinions, either:A) the machine doesn't work = a clever, ingenious movie that i've yet to fully suss.or B) the machine does work = a naff work of fiction that pivots on an, as yet, impossible piece of technology.now aside from the mass of arguments going on in the forums, i'm lead to believe that Nolan has created a film with a *working* machine, this is nothing new, many a hopeless whodunit has cropped up an impossible-to-figure killer in the final real. or, like the prestige, has relied on some bit of gadgetry that turns the entire reality of the movie into a farce... Scream3 springs to mind with the 'voice changer' that'll change anyone's voice into anyone else's.it's about magicians... normal people, creating something mystical, with no more than skill and misdirection... whereas this movie has a normal man, creating a truly mystical effect, with a hugely preposterous work of fiction... if he can invent a 'duplicating' machine back in the Victorian times, then why not just have all the magicians as wizards as well, if you're gonna leap into fantasy, then leap with your whole being, not just plop it in at the end as a silly fix-it.here's hoping someone makes a movie of 'Carter Beats The Devil' instead, set around the same time, with a far more plausible storyline, and characters you really learn to care about.then again, if Nolan comes out in 5 years time and explains to us how the movie works with a *non-working* machine, then all is forgiven, and this is a damn good movie..... but until that day... 3/10"
"Review of The Prestige : I came to see this movie with very high hopes, but came away severely disappointed. In an age where it seems every movie has to have a 'surprise ending' this is no different from many other movies out there at the moment. I guess the bulk of my criticism comes from the fact that I guessed the plot of the film, together with its two theorethically surprise twists at the end about 20 minutes (Tesla exhibition + multiple top-hats in the first scenes of the movie) and 40-45 minutes into the movies (Borden gravediggin'). From then on it was just waiting and saying to myself 'That was so obvious'. At fault is the director and scriptwriter who seemed to throw to much apparent clues too soon in the movie.Chris Bale does I must say a spectacular job as Borden, with Hugh Jackman supplying a satisfying if indifferent performance. The biggest flop was the babe meaning Scarlett Johannson, who seems to think the only thing necessary to act is to show some skin and to pucker up her seductive lips.I especially find flaw with the whole premise of the story... if you do a magic film you take one of three routes to make it coherent and with some cohesive background.A) You include real magic making the story more mystical; B) You put into the movie unexplainable events and leave it to the audience to decide if the magic is real or false; C) You show that everything is a trick, although the tricks are so ingenious that they add a certain punch to the movie.YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING WHICH IS A BIT OF THIS OR A BIT OF THAT making it in a muddled incoherent mess. Unfortunately all solutions to the movie were basically the easiest solutions, meaning that the scriptwriters (novelist?) really didn't try to hard to think of more surprising alternatives to the story.The end solutions were apparent from a mile away, the Scarlett role was dismal and all in all the story very much unimpressive. Giving these factors even though I absolutely love ""Memento"" and congratulate Nolan on ""Batman Begins"" I have to give my thumbs down and a 3/10 (with one point added for Christian Bale's portrayal)."
"Review of The Prestige : Christopher Priest's novel novel on which the film was based is to my mind by far the least interesting of his that I have read. It's reliance on impossible, rather than speculative, science making it ever so slightly ridiculous to this confirmed rationalist. The best feature of the book by far was the complicated narrative methods it used. Needless to say this is totally lost in Nolan's tricksy film. The narrative here is disjointed, not for any obvious effect, but seemingly because this is now Nolan's style, a style he will use regardless of how appropriate it is to the film. What we end up with though is an uninteresting tale badly told, devoid of humour or life. Christian Bale is as mannered as ever, after several films in which he got to use his unconvincing American accent he now sounds equally unconvincing as a cockney. Hugh Jackman is slightly more watchable but Scarlett Johannson is wasted and Bowie as embarrassing as ever. Watching this back to back with the less feted ""The Illusionist"" is instructive, that film was as predictable and old fashioned as could be, it was at least entertaining and Edward Norton runs rings round Bale."
"Review of The Prestige : What is it with the hero-worshipping of Christopher Nolan? Directors are often criticised for style-over-substance and in a weird way Nolan's films suffer the opposite - he's so committed to delivering his convoluted plots, twists and big reveals that he forgets about all the other elements that make a film work. 'The Prestige' is an exceptionally boring, long film populated by dull, unlikeable characters. I don't mind Christian Bale but he was really poor in this, not at all helped by the textbook cockney accent which, whilst good for an (unintentional) laugh at times, really grated on me and felt so disconnected to the character he was portraying. It was as if someone had dubbed a Bob Hoskins voiceover on his parts. Hugh Jackman should stick to action/comic-book films, he's not great at drama and has about three facial expressions. Scarlet Johansson is the same. Her attempt at an English accent rivalled Christian Bale's character for cringe factor. She kept oscillating between Received Pronunciation and Cockney, and occasionally slipped back into American English. The dialect coach must of been tearing their hair out. There was just so much bad acting and unrealistic dialogue in this film that I found it difficult to care about the characters or what was going on. In the scene where Hugh Jackman got shot and then conveniently delivered a load of exposition just before dying was straight out of the Cartoon Villain Death Scene Handbook™. I swear I was covering my mouth to contain the laughter. Just ridiculous. Anyway like most of Christopher Nolan's films the ending draws you back in and did elicit a bit of intrigue but I was so far gone by that point I just didn't care enough. A thoroughly flaccid affair.3 out of 10."
"Review of The Prestige : When compared to the vastly better THE ILLUSIONIST, this film pales. I found myself actually being bored and kept waiting for something, anything to capture my imagination....to wow me. As an audience, the narrator within the film urges us to pay attention, and I did, for the duration - wondering why I didn't go to see another movie. The only real acting in the film was done by the character of Bale's wife in the film. Her scenes were touching...the rest...well lets just the ticket seller was the only one in the theater working slight of hand. Count me completely unimpressed.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were just OK, Michael Caine passable, and Scarlett forgettable. The only thing I can say about this movie is that its about obsession and the damage it can cause. Sorry, nothing magical about that!"
"Review of The Prestige : Bale, Jackman, and Caine, now that sounded like it should've been the best movie one could've wanted to see at theatre. I give you at first I kept thinking it was sort of like Batman versus Wolverine. This movie had the potential to be a great film but at best it was a mediocre attempt at a mysterious period piece. The two main characters were unsympathetic and the others were merely window dressings for their obsessions. I am not really all that much of a Caine fan but I can easily say that he did the best performance of these actors. Even though most of the acting was barely on par, the script and editing were far worse. The timing and movement of this piece took it from a passable film to dreadfully long one. The problem with its length is that it gives you so much time that you figured out all the twists and after that what's the point? I felt mislead with this film as well, it was far more of a revenge flick than a historical fiction. If you are interested in magicians and period pieces try the Illusionist. It was a much better constructed film."
"Review of The Prestige : This movie was a disappointment. Both Jackman and Bales looked uncomfortable portraying magicians. Nolan did a nice job of limiting their acts of prestidigitation, but frankly, it wasn't enough. There was no flamboyance; nothing to make the characters stand out as leading illusionists.Major flaws: There was no explanation as to how the great Danton became so wealthy, wealthy enough to buy his transference machine from Tesla, another boring and disappointing performance.It was obvious from the start that Bales had a twin brother in disguise, and one could easily guess that they switched off doing roles on stage and performing in the boudoir. The unveiling of this secret was... nothing.The whole idea of a machine that created a carbon copy of Danton every performance was just plain dumb. Nikola Tesla was not a mystical character, historically, and to portray him as someone who could transcend the laws of physics was insulting to those of us with more than animal intelligence.I have not yet seen The Illusionist, but I'm sure the performances by Norton and Giamatti will be much better. It can hardly be possible that they could be worse.Mike"
"Review of The Prestige : THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAINE SPOILERS Slowly paced thriller, that comes apart at the seams because of very lazy writing.The filmmakers decided that the concept of being able to fool people a hundred years ago was not enough. They needed to create tricks that were so advanced and that relied on a science that is not even close to existing TODAY.The entire resolution of the movie relies on turning the main characters into super magicians. They can now do things that are quite simply just magic. This is thrown into a movie that is supposed to be about two guys obsessing on how good the other guy might be in their chosen profession.It is a lazy resolution to a high concept idea.It is quite possibly the worst ending to a top flight production in the last twenty years. Why do this? Why create a machine that cannot possibly exist? Why not have something clever or smart be the reason for how these guys can perform the seemingly impossible, but instead resort to abra kadabra thats just the way it is? There is no way to get over this gigantic plot point, that leaves anyone with half a brain watching this movie feel like they have been completely cheated."
"Review of The Prestige : The ""ultimate magic trick"" mentioned in the plot outline on IMDb involves such an unbelievable and unlikely happening that it conflicts with other thematic elements, and leaves one wondering whether this is a science fiction movie or a period movie about magicians. The whole plot is contrived. The movie is not compelling as a whole, only in parts. The acting is fine, but the dialog is often hard to follow--lines spoken too quickly and not distinctly. Don't expect a bright and sunny movie either--most scenes are filmed in dark and dingy sets. The movie starts out alright--two magicians competing for the best trick, but soon the plot devolves into a series of events where each main character seeks the ""ultimate magic trick."" Don't be fooled: this so-called ""ultimate magic trick"" is completely implausible, so the movie looses credibility and believability. If the movie had developed this part of the plot with more emphasis and detail it might have made for a more interesting movie, but as it is, the movie doesn't know if it wants to be a serious drama or a science fiction thriller."
"Review of The Prestige : What comes to mind immediately in reviewing The Prestige, is a comparison to a similar, but far superior movie, The Illusionist. The Illusionist had it all: a great story with a complex but credible plot, great characters (especially Edward Norton as the Illusionist), and a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. The scenes of magic were extraordinary and creepy, transporting the viewer back to the world of a master conjuror's stage in the year 1900. By contrast, The Prestige had a silly, trivial plot that just kept repeating the schtick of two magicians who were rivals for no purpose, unimpressive ""tricks"" on the stage, and the preposterous Tesla device that duplicated everything like a surreal photocopy machine. The movie also took huge liberties, jumping around in time: one minute D'Anton was in London, and the next in Colorado, multiple times. Played fast and loose with parallel universes and time travel, I guess.I kept thinking, do I really care enough to watch the end of this movie? And why is Scarlett Johansen always typecast as a temptress/floozy? She looked like the early 20th century version of the character she played in Match Point, another loser of a movie."
"Review of The Prestige : I did not enjoy this movie nearly as much as I was expecting based on the hype. I gave it such a bad rating to balance the good ones.It moved incredibly slowly, was overly predictable and repetitive, was *barely* redeemable by an exciting yet still BAD ending. It portrays magician performers as kind of lame and immature, not realistic and not relatable. There are some *really bad* actors that play minor roles in this movie. Overall the movie was cheesy and the dialogue is just plain bad. If there was no twist, this movie would have absolutely nothing entertaining about it. Not recommended."
"Review of The Prestige : Although both movies have certain similarities, Victorian, magicians, beautiful people, twist endings, there is one huge difference, ""The Illusionist"" is enjoyable while ""The Prestige"" is a pretentious, manipulated, confusing, mess. The character development is especially weak, the accents barely intelligible, and the time jumps annoying. If the movie had played out in an orderly fashion, it might have proved more enjoyable. I cannot recommend ""The Prestige"". If you must see a magical movie, and enjoy being manipulated toward a twist ending, then ""The Illusionist"" is your movie. At least it makes a little bit of sense. Rate ""The Illusionist"" 7.0, ""The Prestige"" 3.0 - MERK"
"Review of The Prestige : Finally saw this movie for the first time 15 years after its original release and man I have to say, what a terribly organized film. It's a shame, I really looked forward to enjoying this piece only to be left disappointed. Terrible writing and extremely poor character dialogue. Everyone seems to contradict what they say. Chris missed a lot of key developments in throughout the story. Waaaaay too many flashbacks that were completely out of sequence to the story, which in my opinion the downfall of any given piece of film. Perhaps he should have gone to film school after all. I gave it a three-star rating as opposed to one simply because it was well casted."
"Review of The Prestige : The first scene shows about 30 hats scattered on a hillside. We learn later that Nikolai Tesla has this amazing gadget, complete with sparks and mini-lighting and then, flash... there's another hat outside? does it also work with cats? maybe humans too? The second scene has Michael Caine explaining and demonstrating how ""magic"" tricks are done. First, there is ""The Pledge"", ie, something is about to happen, in this case a bird-cage with a canary in it, then comes ""The Turn"", where the cage is covered, then smashed, along with the canary, then... ""The Prestige"", and bingo, the canary is alive and well... maybe? And the audience (one 7-year girl) smiles and applauds. The inference is that such amazement with accompany all the other magic tricks that ensue.The third scene is in a court room where one guy is accused of murder. Throughout the movie, there is flashbacks, and flash-forwards and if you can follow it all, then good luck to you. I couldn't, I thought the whole thing a waste of the talents of all these big-name stars.In my rating process, it gets 0/2 for the story, 0/2 for the characters, partly because Bale and Jackman are of similar age and stature, and one or both adopt disguises that simply adds to my confusion. The acting gets a 1/2, since none of them can do much with such a pointless script. Then there is a 1/2 twice for the writing, production and direction. Is there a single really good scene, with memorable dialogue? 0/2 Different planets? It takes all sorts?"
"Review of The Prestige : A friend loaned the DVD of this movie. I knew nothing about it. I had no preconceptions, just put it in the DVD player and pressed play.I watched and waited. I waited for something to happen. I waited for a character that I could root for, someone I could relate to....it didn't happen. Every character in this movie is flawed...and having no characters that I care about just begs the question - 'why should I care about this movie?'I do admit some strengths: It has very good production values, the settings were meticulously recreated for the period...I actually felt as if it was 1897. Great cast, Christian Bale always delivers, and the direction was taut. I am not saying it is a bad movie, just not my preference.The entire film is telegraphed to the viewer in the first act. To continue watching is an exercise in patience. Every character seemed to garner contempt. The two warring magicians were conniving and murderous. The two female characters were thinly drawn and come across as rather intelligence-challenged. Michael Caine and David Bowie's characters were ethics-challenged to say the least.Alas, the only real magic to The Prestige is that it made my respect for Christopher Nolan disappear. We shall see if ""Tenet"" can evoke the prestige of the trick."
"Review of The Prestige : There's only one way to say it: this is a bad movie! It uses a conventional form of interweaving the past and the present, starting with a pivotal event, the death of one magician with the other in attendance, and weaves back and forth, in and out, all the way through to the present.Within this conventional structure we are supposed to be amazed by the magic, which is not particularly amazing, and we are almost always shown the techniques they use. Again, the magic in the film is mostly conventional.The characters are the part of the movie that is not conventional, each one having enough neuroses and personality disorders to make them interesting, and rather humanly inconsistent, but also annoying and totally unbelievable. And I believe that all things that happen in movies have to appear credible, even the incredible events and plot twists. All of the ones in this movie seem terribly contrived.With all the time they take for exposition (2 hours and 10 minutes!) they still have to hit you over the head with some of the plot points, and that is a sure sign of bad direction -- I won't spoil it by telling you where these are, they are so obvious that you will most likely be able to anticipate every surprise and be a bit bored as I was.What kept me watching was the fabulous Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, and the beautiful sets and costumes of Victorian England."
"Review of The Prestige : This movie is an insult to intelligence.If we admit that the cloning machine exists then why in the world would he have to kill himself ? Why would he have to clone himself every time in front of everybody knowing that he already has a perfect double if he doesn't kill it !!He just has to clone himself one time only !!Why would he bother having a new aquarium for each representations ? And why does he keep the dead clone in the end ?And especially ESCPECIALLY the teleporting man is supposed to be the most amazing trick of all time, well it's not, if I personally witness such a trick I would yawn to death.This movie is dumb to the max, almost everything is rushed, for example I was particularly shocked with the suicide scene. It takes like 10 second : you see the wife looking at bird and next second she is hanging at the ceiling and again the next scene they are talking happily about the suicide... It was so rushed that I had to pause and watch it again thinking I missed a capital clue... But no, just bad bad character development."
"Review of The Prestige : A true mystery cannot include supernatural action or agents unknown to science, nor any physical impossibilities (or even improbabilities).The enjoyment that one gets from watching a mystery unfold is in the collection of clues by a gifted amateur detective (either a character in the story, or the audience itself with some aid from the script), the clever mis-direction and art of the author, and a satisfying conclusion.The conclusion is the key -- it must be innovative, and coherent. (Agatha Christie, of course, was the master. Everyone on the Orient Express did it; that's original, and satisfying. The police officer set the Mousetrap; that's original, and satisfying. The hanging judge faked his own death in order to direct suspicion elsewhere; that's original, and satisfying.) What is the point of crafting a lenghty story, and then saying at the end: ""Yes, it all WAS possible, see? The existence of the *flibbertigibbet machine* means that it could have happened."" A 'twist' that amounts to ""I, the writer, can do whatever I damn well please"" is simply hackneyed.'Electrical cloning' is impossible. It cannot be done. Saying it can -- and was, by Nikola Tesla -- is idiotic.While we're throwing around impossibilities concerning historical figures, we might as well just make a film about Queen Elizabeth I conquering Mars, or Julius Caesar inventing time travel using silver coins and sunshine. What an absolute waste of my time.PS. If the machine was a diversion -- all of the flashbacks and double-crosses muddied the story sufficiently to allow the possibility -- I still want to know why there are human forms in all of the many water tanks in the warehouse at the end of the film.The question the author wants us to ask is: are these the dead canaries, so to speak, or are they yet another layer of mis-direction?I think I can say this: if this were just another layer, and I am supposed to believe that the human forms are manniquins or stolen corpses, I am even more angry with the author. A pathetically low level of storytelling would have been reached.Both choices come out to the same result: a horrific stain on the good name of the mystery."
"Review of The Prestige : This film really annoyed the hell out of me. It is definitely an entry into the oeuvre of movies that are so obsessed by how clever its twists are that it forgets to worry about things such as sympathetic characterisation, naturalistic expositional dialogue, and, most crucially, the effective execution of said oh-so-clever twists.First, a few points about the script. The script is dreadful in parts, with exposition that may as well be spoken directly to camera. The characters, Hugh Jackman's in particular, seem unrounded and without any kind of back story - seemingly plopped into the middle of an obsessive pursuit without any explanation as to where said obsessions may have originated. As happens in so many Hollywood movies, the female roles are perfunctory up to the point of pastiche - did anyone else groan with anticipation of how banal and run-of-the-mill Scarlett Johansson would be? I'd like to see a studio movie that, in the absence of an integral love story, crowbars in some half-assed romance entirely for the sake of some demograph of dubious existence who are believed to not want to see a movie without some histrionic sexual politics.Now, on to those twists, of which there are two major ones. The first, whose set up is established very early on, is glaringly obvious. I spent most of the film seething with frustration as lines that, in what i guess the makers hoped would be in hindsight, are massively irritating 'clues' to the audience. All this is abrogated by the fact that it was all clear to me from the off (and i wasn't aware there was a twist to the film so i wasn't looking out for one), all due to the fact that essential production values fail to adequately disguise the twist. The second twist, which acts not only as plot but supposedly as a thematic comparison to the first, is what left me wanting my money back. The filmmakers seemed to have forgotten that suspension of disbelief must be eared through establishing what can an cannot happen in the world they have created. For example, in The Matrix, when we shown that it is Trinity's love for Neo that brings him back from the dead, the audience is able to accept this because the reality that has been established is one of sci-fi machines-rule-the-world type. We have been prepared to be asked to go along with the possible. The Prestige, a film that throughout its running time shows and tells us that the magic in the film is one rooted in realistic trickery and that the rivalry between the two main characters is based on which can come up with the cleverest ruse, believes that it does not need to ask the audience to suspend its disbelief before laying down the biggest of deus ex machina macguffins seen in recent cinema. We are expected to believe that within this realistic turn of the century world that a machine is invented that (through science, not magic) can do what remains impossible in the present. This 'twist' represents lazy, lazy storytelling - it is like the writers could not come up with an actual clever ending so just used their get out of jail free card instead.On the side, there are some very pretty things to look at, with impressive period detail and some imaginative compositions from Nolan. Michael Caine and Andy Serkis are both excellent, and its always nice to see David Bowie on screen, but thats where the acting plaudits stop. Bale and Jackman give in uncharismatic and unlikeable performances and Johanssen floats along on a wave of arbitrariness.I would say to avoid this film, unless you enjoy the energy that truly hating a film can give you, as it has to me."
"Review of The Prestige : I watched the movie (and read the book) because IMDb reviewers slammed ""Now You See Me"" and said real magic movies, like The Prestige and the Illusionist, are what filmmaking is all about. Well, I can say the Prestige was better than the Illusionist. And both were pieces of crud.Enter the adaptation of a bad book, The Prestige. The setup is simple - two rival magicians try to outdo each other, and their game escalates until people start getting seriously hurt. That should be easy enough to pull off, no? No. Here comes the sci-fi element that has absolutely nothing to do with the illusions the magicians were attempting before. Suddenly, what could have been a believable, but slow, plodding, and boring, period tale is now utter nonsense. And, the critical details about the sci-fi element are only told at the very end of the movie. At least the book let you warm up to the nonsense.The relationship between Bale and Johansen gets exactly two lines. And that is an incredibly important part of the story! The book treats this better, and the book was awful.This could be the movie that keeps me off of IMDb forever. You people are nuts if this is a 8/9 out of 10. The only good part of the experience was knowing I got the movie from the library, so this nonsense didn't cost me a dime."
"Review of The Prestige : For movie that is in top 250, has such high rating and so much positive reviews it is really disappointing. It is really far from good movie and irritated me so much that I felt like writing my first ever review.First, start with good, or more precisely not so bad. Well, premise is good, and if this was done better maybe I would be interested in how they did tricks. And Tesla was very well done. Bowie was excellent choice for Tesla. Other than that I can't remember even single redeeming quality of this movie.Now, bad parts. Oh boy, where to begin.No likable characters. There isn't a single character in here that I can connect to or even like! And who is there to like? Angier who only wants to steal ""magic"" trick from Borden with no consideration for those around him? Borden(s) who has such bad attitude towards his wife and daughter? Mother who hangs herself out of jealousy and leaves her daughter alone? Olivia, who is so forgettable that she just dropped out from movie for no apparent reason and no one noticed? Nope, nope and nope... Rest of characters are so bland or appear so little that are not even worth of mentioning. Central plot should be rivalry between two illusionists. But their actions are so unrealistic and bland I had feeling like only thing pushing plot forward was will of the writer. And that is really bad storytelling.In a movie which presents itself like realistic we get such outrages deus-ex for main plot line it made me cringe. A machine that copies anything! A machine in 19th century which copies anything and can teleport! What? Really? Before this was introduced I still had some hope to rate this movie as watchable, but this just buried my hopes. Oh, and why there is no Sci-Fi category mark for this movie is beyond me.Scenes are jumping all over the place. One dude is reading diary of another dude, who at some point is reading diary of first dude, and all of that we get after opening scene that showed us main character die... Did I mentioned confusing time-line? Plot twists. Well, to be frank there is just one and that is revelation that Borden has a twin brother and that is how he does his Transportation trick. So greatest mystery, only thing in this movie worth anything, is revealed to be the simplest possible solution. Still, it wasn't that bad and there are hints to this. Problem is lack of other plot twists in what should be mystery driven movie.And why in the world Borden doesn't reveal his wife that he has a twin... Both twins slept with women they don't like and lied to family because of some stupid illusion trick? And cut fingers? And allow wife to hang herself because of this and leave his daughter motherless? Someone actually wants me to believe that? So when exactly they decided to act like one person? And how no one even noticed, his (their) wife never met ANY relative of Bordens who knew they were twins when they were little? So bad characters, bad plot, bad pacing, no point to the story, bad Sci-Fi elements... How can anyone, let alone so much people, give this movie good review is beyond me."
"Review of The Prestige : Memento was much worse than this, but The Prestige is empty and nonsensical in equal measure. At what point did the two brothers decide, 'Crikey, we ought to give up this brothers lark and hide ourselves from the world so we can pull off the Transported Man trick'? When they were still kids? And who thought it was a good idea to cast David Bowie as the Serbian lord of alternating current? If you like movies with two preposterous twists -- it's not just the twin brothers who are so dedicated to their art that they'd chop off their fingers and sleep with each other's girlfriends, but A MACHINE THAT ACTUALLY TELEPORTS PEOPLE ACROSS VARYING BUT QUITE SHORT DISTANCES!! -- then this is definitely for you.One thing I've learned is that, if ever you chance upon the diary or journal of your nemesis, make sure you read from the back to the front. You have been warned!"
"Review of The Prestige : This is a very good example of Hollywood spending a lot of money on stars and directors to try to make a great, deep movie, and failing. The ""art style"" editing, cutting scenes back and forth in time, trying to make the story, cut up, seem deeper than it is.Why is he in Denver, where is Tesla, why is Scarlet Johannsen even in this movie, who cares about the surprise ending (and who believes it?)?? These are all good questions that we scarcely care about. Just looking at my watch waiting for it to end.The actors are good, but you actually need an interesting story to tell. A similar period (Sherlock Holmes' London) is done much better with the Downey/Law flic just out. For this one, don't see it in a theater, don't pay to rent it, maybe watch it if someone lends you a copy or you are huge Hugh Jackman fan, otherwise, save your energy."
"Review of The Prestige : When I left the cinema after watching 'The Prestige', I tried to make head or tail of its storyline and eventually had to give up. This movie is a hotchpotch of unclear situations, flashbacks, mysterious allusions to the extent that in the end nothing makes much sense. Some of the comments on this website did help clarify a number of issues, but in the end the tortuous plot and the all-too-frequent twists and turns had me throw in the towel. It is to be regretted that, in order to ensure the success (?) of a movie, film directors have to resort to irritating 'postmodern' techniques requiring an above-average IQ and a PhD in cinema studies. Oh, for the simplicity and directness of 'Snowwhite and the seven dwarfs'! Among the many unresolved issues, one detail continues to exercise my mind: what is the significance of the small red ball which continues to be thrown at some of the characters and is then thrown back to the sender?"
"Review of The Prestige : It must be so long since there actually was a really good movie that people think this is a masterpiece. Nice to look at, well-acted, prominent cast, the welcome return of David Bowie, but too gimmicky to be a complete ""masterpiece"". Using the last 10 minutes or so to provide a series of lame explanations to attempt to redeem the integrity of this ""epic"" is not good enough. And is Scarlett Johansson trying to put all other young actresses out of work by appearing in a string of unmemorable parts in unmemorable movies? Hey Hollywood, give someone else a chance and save her for the next big movie where Josh Hartnett again attempts to justify ""actor"" as his occupation."
"Review of The Prestige : Before I forget: Somebody said this was the best twisting movie since Fight Club. Honestly, must you make such a pointless comparison? Not only was Fight Club a hundred times better than this movie, the only thing it shares is the fact that people look like other people. Deal with it.I thought it could be a good movie - but then, of course, I watched it. This was a chance to make something great. It had good acting, famous actors, pretty cinematography and and a pretty neat premise about Tesla and his magic electricity/ duplication machine stuff. It failed, though, rather miserably. Now, it would have been a good movie, had it been muted, all the death and violent scenes, cut out, and simply been a showcase of interesting shots and pretty colors. And, of course, Tesla' cloning machine. In fact, the premise of the movie was pretty stupid. Seriously, there was no reason to make them magicians at all. Anybody can kill people, it just provides more interesting deaths if they can drown people in tanks or have people shot with their own guns. Take a hint from Pan's Labyrinth. Just grab the other guy and stab them in the face outright. It was confusing throughout. I eventually got it, but I had to pause the movie a few times. I'm not stupid, it was just so unexpectedly confusing I had to pause and think. Okay, so some guy called Angier drowns in a tank. The other guy, Bordon, goes to jail, and reads the dead guy's journal. The bits from the past switched between the dead guy reading the diary of the guy in jail, and the events leading up to him getting the diary. Both the past and present have a lot of unneeded jumping around all over the place, and in between all of that, the magicians end up hurting and killing a bunch of random people. They steal each others tricks, most notably the ""Transporting Man trick"". Eventually, Angier finishes reading Bordon's diary which ends with something like ""I KNOW YOU HAVE THIS, I GAVE IT TO YOU ON PURPOSE. MWA!"" As Bordon finishes reading Angier's diary, he gets a similar message. Finally, the movie confesses outright (although it hinted throughout) that Angier had created doubles that died every time, and as actually alive, (he most likely framed Bordon) and he steals Bordon's daughter for revenge and Bordon prepares to be hanged. Cutter refuses to let Bordon be hanged, but then doesn't care that Bordon (who had a double; one always posed as his agent. this is also how he did the transporting man trick.) gets the happy ending because he shot Angier, who made a ridiculous speech about how he never wanted Bordon's trick and just wanted to 'see the audiences' faces'. ""OMG, they clap for me! Must kill more people!"" After Bordon shot Angier, Cutter should have shot Bordon. Then they would have both gotten what they deserved. Except poor little girl would be all sad with no father. Cutter wouldn't want that.Oh yes, and one of the Bordon's loved Emily, their wife, and the other loved Olivia. Emily got mad because of the ""affair"", if you could even call it that, and so she hung herself. Rather stupid if you ask me.Speaking of the deaths, I thought the whole ""Oh noes, Angier's wife is dead"" thing to be idiotic. It started the whole stupid story. Throughout the whole movie, Bordon repeats ""I don't know which knot I tied."" Wow, I think you would, considering you specifically changed your frigging mind about what you were tying halfway through. I mean, seriously.What's wrong with you people? Get over it! I mean, seriously, you can't be that crazy obsessed, since the movie didn't mention the origin of this insane obsession. Oops. Never mind. Bad move, Nolan.The only reason this deserves a three is because of the actors, the cinematography, and the fact that it made me mad enough to slap everyone involved. Except David Bowie, because, in all honesty, the Tesla parts were all pretty cool in premise. They should have made the movie all about him. Three Cheers for ""Tesla: The Movie"".Was I really the only one who thought Scarlett looked a bit like Keira Knightley?"
"Review of The Prestige : (Contains no real spoiler, but could prompt a naive viewer to draw conclusions prematurely.) The intrigue of magic, what invites people to suspend disbelief for a moment, is the realization that the trick never IS supernatural; completing it doesn't require the violation of laws of physics, although all one's senses tells you it must.This movie, although beautifully composed and photographed, relies on sci-fi stunts to carry the story, which I think cheapen it and preclude it from being brilliant, even clever.Also, using the analytical tool of working backward from the ending to determine the likelihood of the events that preceded it, there are a number of problems with the story. Apparently, these magicians could not only conjure up illusions, but could also read minds and foretell the future.A big disappointment. . ."
"Review of The Prestige : SERIOUS SPOILERS and RANTS!!!! (For The Prestige AND The Illusionist) I just don't understand it--I've read the reviews of this movie here on Amazon and only one other person seems to also feel that the movie was ridiculously predictable early on. The clues were in your face, and then repeated/flaunted/displayed over and over, ad nauseum. Then, to add insult to injury on top of the old hackneyed ""twin theme,"" some pseudoscience is thrown in to boot (clones created ""Highlander"" style--absurd bolts of electricity and all--Star Trek did cloning better in the 60's with Kirk on the whirly machine thing for God's sake). So Jackman's character kills himself/his clones over and over during every show waiting for the one time when Bale's character goes backstage, consequently pinning Jackman's murder on him. At the end they ""divulge"" the big secret that Bale has a twin (DUH?), and then the last scene shows Jackman floating in a tank and we're all supposed to go--wha? I mean wasn't it obvious that Jackman was killing himself over and over? (Or were all those hats and cats just extraneous props to throw us off?) And the Lord is...who?...is it really Hugh Jackman? Geez I didn't see that one coming...only A MILE AWAY. People keep comparing this movie to The Illusionist, but I thought the ending of The Illusionist was equally insulting--I mean, Paul Giamatti had to recount all the steps leading to the ""secret"" of the movie, when it was really obvious early on what had happened. I can only see Ed Norton, who was fantastic in Down in the Valley (as a dubious/not b&w character that kept you thinking) in the edit room arguing, ""What? Why do we have to spoon feed the audience?"" (Wasn't this ""recap"" device used already in Usual Suspects anyway?--only in Usual Suspects it was effective and necessary--at the end of the movie you really do go ""ah ha! I didn't see that coming! Simply brilliant."") Christian Bale was incredible in The Machinist and American Psycho (even Batman was interesting). He has the charisma of a rock in The Prestige. Michael Caine is...basically Michael Caine. Hugh Jackman--he IS Wolverine. In this movie he falls flat. I don't feel his anger. I should want Bale's character incinerated for what he did, though maybe inadvertently, to Jackman's wife. But I don't feel anything. I've been a fan of Scarlett since Ghost World. No extraordinary acting here though. David Bowie, however, (whether he looks like the real Tesla or not) was very engaging. I wanted to see more of him. Oh well. I give it two stars just because I love the actors, though not in this particular movie."
"Review of The Prestige : A great disappointment. Save your money and skip this movie. Two rival magicians appear to be one trick ponies. An audience will easily guess the secret behind their apparent magic. The romantic entanglements are entirely unconvincing. Interweaving of characters, the movie viewer never knowing for sure who is who, leaves the film-goer in a muddle. In the end, it is not worth working out the details. A waste of my time, and yours if you see it.Actors are all fine. A bitter rivalry between Nikola Tesla and Edison over direct current or alternating current as the best means of transmitting electricity has just a bit of a mention without all the drama it took in real life. Tesla surprisingly well portrayed by David Bowie. Edison does not appear but sends thugs to burn down Tesla's laboratory. (Highly unlikely.) Too bad the writers did not see fit (or did NOT know) to show the first use of AC in the electric chair to execute condemned criminals was touted by the Edison camp as showing how dangerous AC current was. I would certainly have written this into the script as it would fit nicely with the plot as it developed.I liked ""The Illusionist"" better as a film about magicians performing on stage, a better portrayal of the Victorian era, and a much better love story. This film never revealed the secret of the magician's tricks, a far better decision thins in ""The Prestige""."
"Review of The Prestige : Smarmy from front to back. All the principals are despicable. Nothing is visually interesting. The score is bad. It's slow talking, slow paced, slow to get ended. They could cut 45 minutes and omit nothing. Miserable lighting in most of the movie--feels like cavemen putting on a show. And why on earth would anyone pay the entrance fee when the light is too dim to see the magic. Magic isn't believe-able when it can't be seen. There is all too much of ""it must be so because the movie says it is so"" no matter how utterly preposterous it is in today's cinema -- Ocean's Eleven is another example.It's all in English but the deliveries are so bad that it is often impossible to make out what they are saying. Instead of shooting a scene again to get it right, they just write a repeat into the script so you can get it the second or third time it happens. Yuk---I want my money back. A Royal Nonesuch through and through.I can see why it is soooooo important to check the spoiler box on the review when the only reason to see a movie is to get a few moments of disgust at the end of the film when at long last the Scooby Doo moment finally slouches onto the screen. Please leave Scooby Doo to Scooby Doo -- he is so much better at it."
"Review of The Prestige : Two magicians really don't each like other.Possibly there's an interesting obsession/revenge film in that plot outline somewhere, but not in this shockingly over-rated bore-fest.Someone once said, 'if anything can happen, then nothing happens'. It's boring. Having no limits isn't liberating - it's dull. Throwing a gazillion twists, having characters radically alter their personalities on a whim, death, suicide, betrayal yadda yadda!Less is more. Unless you're Christopher Nolan - in which case, just chuck absolutely everything you can think of at the screen and hope some of it sticks. Newsflash - it doesn't. Throw in some of the worst British accents this side of Dick van Dyke and hey presto - you've got the Prestige. IMDB top 250?! oh please.2 stars - 1 each for David Bowie and Michael Caine, both of whom somehow got roped into acting in this turkey."
"Review of The Prestige : I finished reading the darkly elegant novel ""The Prestige"" by Christopher Priest about a week before renting the DVD. Perhaps I was setting myself up for disappointment, but the movie is an absolute dog; it pales in comparison to the novel. I have to wonder what Christoper Priest thinks of this film.Call me a purist, but I would love to see the novel made into a movie that respects the story's original plot structure. Too much that is worthwhile in the novel, such as the addition of Borden's and Angier's descendants to frame the story, has been deleted. Too much that is ridiculous has been added to the film. The story has been butchered beyond belief. I realize that Nolan is known for playing with the chronology of events, but his piecemeal approach destroys any possibility of real dramatic tension building towards any sort of climax.One of the strengths of the novel was that the story was told largely in the form of diaries the two magicians had written. This offered us some back story to give context to the conflict between Angier and Borden, and also allowed us to get inside their heads. The characterizations in the movie, are for the most part, extremely one-dimensional and superficial - completely without subtlety. The acting is mostly a snore, with flat performances from most of the actors, an exception being Rebecca Hall, who showed some emotional depth and engaged the viewer. At least the special effects were snazzy. But far more electricity was generated by Tesla's machine than existed between any of the characters, which is really too bad. I just got bored with it all.If you haven't seen this picture, don't waste your time. Just read the book."
"Review of The Prestige : Spoilers... It did have some interesting aspects to the movie, but overall I was bored by their rivalry and such. Plus I disliked borden's character altogether. He obviously killed Angier's wife for whatever reason and yet he's the one who got married, and had a kid, so for me the wrong guy was shot... I hate movies that leave you with a bad taste in your mouth and this one certainly did for me. It seems stupid to me that Borden had a twin brother that nobody knew about. And even more retarded was this cloning machine idea. More or less it's a grudge match against two magicians, and not much more. Scarlett was beautiful as always, but what a bitch she played IMO. Oh well i guess this is why you can't always go by the ratings... Better luck next time I guess"
"Review of The Prestige : This had a lot of potential and the same tricks as batman begins. The dreary landscapes and overt use of dull colors to make to movie more sombre than it actually is. If I didn't know better I would guess that Nolan had a gay affair with Christian bale. Bale needs to overcome his lisp( speech impediment) and his 1 dimensional acting. The plot is predictable and sometimes you are tricked to think that there could be more than the obvious, but that feeling is ephemeral. British accents are laughable and the premise of Tesla inventing duplicating machines is an challenging ones intelligence. The Nolans need to ease up on the toke and think of something less inane. I'm afraid that the people who were awed by this insipid movie need to increase their cognitive capabilities."
"Review of The Prestige : The perfect example of a great cast wasted. It's a remarkably uninteresting movie in which the ""surprise"" ending was pitifully easy to spot. The fact that the ending was obvious is secondary to the fact that each of the main characters were extremely unlikable individuals. What a waste of talent.The film is a pale shadow of the source material. The director tries to misdirect the viewer with an intricate flashback structure that begins at a trial, before time-traveling through the lives of the magicians as young men. The magicians fall in love with various women while escalating their nasty attempts to expose, outdo and injure each other.Their obsession to obtain each other's trade secrets and become the most esteemed illusionist becomes dull and falls somewhere on the scale between weird science and bad science, this plot development adds another layer of nonsense to the drama. There's no real magic here. For more likable characters and better sleight-of-hand storytelling, see The Illusionist."
"Review of The Prestige : This movie is a complete waste of time. The main characters are dull and poor actors. The whole plot seems inconceivable, on top of mundane and predictable. Instead of having a clever and interesting solution they resort to everyone has a clone. The characters have no depth whatsoever. They have nothing outside of their obsessions. Full of illogical twists and turns that make no sense whatsoever - what the hell does Tesla have to do with anything? Why wouldn't anyone notice the clones?Just don't see this movie, long, boring, horrible plot, and waste of time."
"Review of The Prestige : thats right i enjoy Hugh Jackman & Christian bale movies but this just caused me pain its been a month & i am still recovering from this boring explosion,my whole body is in pain.all the actors looks bored & Christopher Nolan what is wrong with this guy his batman films are good but when he picks up a camera he loves to film in the night or even in the daylights cant shoot a scene with proper light.& please the length of the film is 2 hours please stop trolling the audiencenow lets get to the plot OK all the critics & people who praise this movie i hate them no seriously i get the plot tow guys want to be the best in the business of magic & be ultimate bale & Hugh Jackman were on coke that day when they signed this film.all that twists in the movie until the end i knew one of them was gonna lose it would have been nice if they both were cool & walked away.& that big machine & crazy science stuff is a joke what these guy are drinking i want that.i am saying is please don't hate me for my review a lot of people are gonna thumb me down specially Nolan fans guys i like Nolan but i don't droll over him.so please forgive me if i don't like this OK.my rating is 2/10 for some nice magic show but stay away from this movie i say because the prestige is for sleepy people only"
"Review of The Prestige : This is a complete mess of a movie.
Not only it does not follow the plot of the book it is based on, it violates all principles of what should be ethical when generating a plot for a movie.The mix of historic figures like Tesla and science fiction can NEVER be an acceptable resource, except for comedy or class C Sci-fi movies.But not only it mixes ""real"" magic with science fiction in order to ""explain"" the plot, even with the science fiction component the plot does not make sense. A few things that should have happened for the plot to be plausible:Tesla should be not only a genius, but also really dumb to sell (or give away?) a machine capable of teletransportation. cloning and/or duplicating objects that could make him millionaire just replicating gold.Bales's character wife should be really dumb not to realize she was dealing with two brothers for YEARSAngier had to test and calibrate the machine. That would have created SEVERAL clones of himself that were not immediately killed and had to be killed later and their bodies disposed. Quite unlikely they would accept that destiny easily.If Angier was making 100 shows, he would have 100 bodies to dispose....which were never discovered before the final shown and neither after it, when police would have investigated.It would require the machine to create not just a duplicate, but a person with all memories and same twisted thinking process as the original body.Why would Bale's character send Angier to see Tesla, instead of ANYWHERE else? If the argument is because he KNEW Tesla was working on cloning or tele transportations so it would be credible, why wouldn't he suspect that was the trick when Angier came back with an improved trick?Why is it that the two persons that drown die instantly and no attempt of resuscitation is made? They both could have survived and be revived, even with the limited knowledge of the time. The glass was broken just a few seconds after both lost consciousness. There have been people revived in REAL events after 40 MINUTES of immersion in water, and certainly it would be possible just a few seconds afterwards.I watched the movie with interest, although it was confusing at times, it is clear that a lot of money, resources and acting power was used. But after it ended I felt cheated, the plot kills it.It is not science fiction, it is not drama, it is not romance, it is a NOTHING. Waste of time."
"Review of The Prestige : This contains spoilers but the film deliberately spoils its own plot.I loved the first half of the film - thinking I was in for multiple insights into magician's tricks and for the narrative to play similar tricks on the viewer. In fact, of course, a trick is played on the viewer, but it is infuriating, disappointing, cynical and ultimately leaves you feeling cheated. I give two stars out of 10 because it is well shot and the first third/half is done well - 0 out of 10 for the rest of the film SPOILERS: The film sets up and then deliberately telegraphs what the ""answer"" is to Borden's trick, (which is the same ""answer"" to the plot). The idea is to get the audience to guess that Fallon is Borden's double, but then to reject it because it is so obvious and too poor a denouement to a two-hour film, which is predicated (eg, by Cutter's VOs) on being clever and which is constantly, if implicitly, bragging that it will fool you. It plays upon the sophisticated modern viewer's knowledge that there must be a very clever solution at the end of the film - then defeats your expectations when the exceptionally obvious solution (which has been continually raised throughout the film) is, in fact, the real and only solution. So you have the jarringly obvious clues that Borden is two people which occur right the way throughout the film, in the comments of his wife for instance; the painfully obvious underplaying of Fallon's character (in a film in which Tesla is played by David Bowie, you very quickly notice you don't even know which bizarre choice of actor the casting director has called upon to play Fallon, while it is rather comically obvious at all times that he is wearing ""a disguise"") - and of course, Cutter simply announces that Borden obviously has a double. The only reason given for this not to be true is that his double has also lost his fingers - given Borden's insistence that you have to sacrifice yourself for your art, it is easily guessed that the double has cut his fingers off too. Just as the characters within the film denounce the ""double"" solution as being too obvious, so the audience is meant to - Nolan creates this ""answer"" in such a way as to make it look like a red herring. When the red herring turns out to be the true plot twist and not mis-direction, you have been fooled - but in a deeply disappointing way - the only twist is that, in fact, there is no twist. Instead of leaving you gasping in admiration at the cleverness of a plot ""trick"", the film simply leaves you annoyed and disappointed. Of course, Cutter and Borden have been saying all along, while talking of tricks, that it is very disappointing when you realise how obvious the solution to a trick is - but this should not apply to the denouement of a film - you should not be disappointed. This disillusionment was very quickly followed, in my case at least, by the realisation that the doubles ""plot"" is ludicrous - why don't Borden and ""Fallon"" not tell the wife that there are two of them, which would solve her suicidal anguish and, presumably, the anguish of one of the brothers. Instead,the twins/doubles allow her to believe her husband is having an affair and doesn't love her half of the time - when in fact her husband loves her all the time and is not having an affair, it is his twin who is sleeping with Olivia. In fact, why do they keep swapping roles and Borden/Fallon alternate who talks to the wife? It is merely cruel, pointless and, of course, has only occurred to serve the feeble plot line. How anyone can call this a 10/10 film is utterly beyond me.There is a final insult to the viewer's intelligence - while Borden's trick turns out to have the obvious solution, Angier's trick is not a trick at all - it involves some sort of sci-fi Star Trek teleporter. You are also shown this before the end, so even this deeply poor ""solution"" is not kept as some sort of final revelation.Waste of two hours of my time - I'm still angry about it so it has basically screwed another hour afterwards too"
"Review of The Prestige : I mean you're supposed to feel conned that was the concept of the movie. What I felt conned by was the shoddy script/dialogue and 2D characters - must you become a drunk cliché when your lovers dies looking all mad eyed with the long hair and all??? Must you act 'ave a cuppa tea gvnor!' Scarlett?? I swear I heard you say 'like totally!' But most of all, what really made me mad what really insulted was the end twist! You mean to tell me you spent the whole movie working towards something that was so obvious!! We saw it half an hour during the movie, we guessed it in the relationships! We saw it written in the very in your face dramatic irony! We saw it as obvious as all my exclamation marks! There wasn't even an attempt at diversion. It was poor. The way the movie hid the twist was the the same way as Dick Dastardly plotted his evil doings.The fact that this movie has already gone into the top 250 shows that our audience can be fooled by anything. Get The Thin Red Line into the top 250 and then maybe, maybe I'll talk with some respect."
"Review of The Prestige : I've heard of suspending disbelief but this is ridiculous. Tesla did not invent a teleportation machine. Creating this fantasy isn't a satisfying solution to how Jackman was able to do his teleportation act. ""The Prestige"" isn't the sort of movie where the motivations of the characters is enough to carry the plot, as it was in Amedeus. So much of the plot is sprinkled with revelations of magic tricks that I was expecting a rational explanation for Jackman's trick. I don't think anybody can claim this is irrelevant to the plot. Quite frankly the only thing about this story that held my interest was the possibility that the explanation for the trick would be clever. Instead it was just as disappointing as the time my parents told me there was no santa claus.""The Prestige"" was long, boring and the plot twists were trite."
"Review of The Prestige : Great sets, good actors, a reasonable story, but spoiled by Hollywood once again low-balling the viewers IQ.To resolve the competition between two magicians, the story introduces a scientist who creates for one of the magicians a device capable of duplicating whatever is put into it.Having acquired this duplicating device, the magician then uses it to create copies of himself, which he drowns as part of his magic act. This act of repeated self-murder allows him to successfully compete with his rival, although we only discover the mechanism behind the successful magic act at the very end of the film.Surely the act of creating a copy of yourself only to ask him to commit suicide as a means of furthering ones competitive goals deserves a better treatment than that given in this film.There's a story here far more interesting than the one presented."
"Review of The Prestige : There was very little to enjoy in this movie. The characters were so unsympathetic as to create apathy for what ever happens next. The plot was predictable; the twists were contrived and silly.The movie itself, while very stylish and pretty to look at, felt forced. It lacks the smooth illusionist's quality that allows us to suspend disbelief and be deceived or dive in and accept the illusion. Instead it bumps along and tries to bully us into believing that we were just fooled.The greatest success of the movie is the creation of the period. The costumes, sets and scenery do an excellent job of putting us in the setting. Visually, the movie is excellent.Dr. Tesla's scientific solution is a horrible plot contrivance that turns a mediocre movie into a something worse. The result of the experiment fails to surprise or shock. The ""trick"" can be seen coming at us. Personally, I wanted be wrong and hoped there would be some final plot twist that would surprise and redeem this movie. There wasn't.This movie fails to come together. As the film draws to a conclusion, it is very hard to care which character will win. Both are reprehensible enough that it is just too late to care what happens.The Prestige is just frustrating to sit through for all the wrong reasons."
"Review of The Prestige : 'Prestige' starts as Jules Verne and ends as Star Trek on a bad day.Atrocious acting: Ever heard of 'Mummerset? It's the word used to describe the ridiculous accent that actors use to indicate they're from the English countryside, the sort of 'ooh-arr' sound that Robert Newton makes in 'Captain Blood'. In 'The Prestige', the ridiculous accent used is 'Mockney', the one actors use to sledgehammer that they're from London. Luckily for Michael Caine, he was born an East Londoner, but the rest of the troupe in this pile of tripe look and sound like they're auditioning for 'Eastenders' (a dreadful UK soap), trying to out-gorblimey each other. Caine does his usual reliable turn as the worldly-wise buddy who's powerless to stop things going wrong, as seen in 'The Man Who Would Be King'. And go wrong they do. When David Bowie is the actor giving the best performance in your movie, you're in trouble. The interchangeable cardboard magician's girl assistants do not manage the transition from TV acting to big screen at all. Caine once did a TV 'masterclass' about screen acting, the upshot being that you shouldn't blink in closeup - note how all the other actors fail to observe this rule, and it shows Caine was right.Preposterous plot: The movie opens with the death of Jackman, where Bale is on Death Row for his murder, and is told partially in flashback to when Bale and Jackman are rival magicians. Bale, for some reason he can't remember, contrived to cause Jackman's wife to die in a trick, so that naturally Jackman is obsessed with revenge. He's also obsessed with discovering the secret of Bale's 'Transported Man' trick, where the magician instantaneously moves from one side of the stage to another. Now at this point, about an hour in, I thought I'd guessed the ending. Jackman has to hire a double in order to pull off Bale's transportation trick; the only problem is that he ends the show beneath the stage while the drunken, stroppy double gets all the applause. (Somewhere along the way, Jackman acquires a wooden leg, which appears overnight, but doesn't seem to inconvenience him beyond a slight limp). Of course, I thought - Jackman eventually gets the double to perform the 'Pledge and Turn' (the opening premise of the trick), so that the double is the one who gets drowned in the tank placed below stage by Bale. I was wrong. We are eventually asked to switch from a reasonably atmospheric period melodrama (think 'The First Great Train Robbery') to schoolboy science fiction. Jackman, at vast expense of which we get no explanation, buys a cloning machine - yes, a cloning machine - from real-life distinguished inventor Nikola Tesla (Bowie). Every time he performs the trick, Jackman dies and is cloned back to life, in the traditional 'Star Trek' transportation manner. What? WHAT? Just as well Tesla's machine didn't work, or he'd be back to give Christopher Nolan a piece of his mind. Sadly not a joke: if 'Prestige' were even just a little tongue-in-cheek or camp, you might be able to feel that your intelligence was not being not just insulted but placed in the stocks and pelted with rotten vegetables, ordure, and pseudo-science as seen in ads for hair conditioner. No, 'Prestige' is deadly serious about itself as a history lesson and as a drama. Starting as Edgar Allen Poe meets Jules Verne, it ends up as Doctor Who meets Star Trek, and it's a train wreck. A terrible film."
"Review of The Prestige : I much preferred 'The Illusionist', as that film at least had likable characters a viewer could hope would prevail, in the end. I've seen 'The Prestige' twice, now, and I think even less of it after the 2nd viewing than I did after the first. But, people seem to really identify more, these days, with characters that have no redeeming moral values, and are driven by their dark obsessions to the point of whatever-it-takes. A totally sad, sick, unsatisfying ending.Others have said that one has to have intelligence, and a healthy attention span to enjoy this movie, and I would also add to that, a true interest in magic, and how it works. Though the real 'meat' of the film lay in the personalities, I felt they were suffocated by layers of intricate plot weavery of how the tricks were accomplished, and if you aren't interested in that? this can be a very long watch. I have endured, rather than enjoyed."
"Review of The Prestige : How so many people can like a film with such a low quality of writing is beyond me. I am about to tear the film apart. If you have not seen this film, please stop reading now. The film has very good sets and the acting is well done. I cannot complain about either of these two aspects of the film. All actors are top notch. My big beef is with the logic of the storyline. The film starts off with a murder. Hugh Jackman is found drowned in a water tank after falling into it through a trap door from the stage above. Hugh Jackman is copying a magic trick that is done by Christian Bale does with his twin brother who is always disguised and no one knows he has a twin. Later, you find out Hugh Jackman finds a scientist named Tesela who created a machine that can create doubles of anything, but it teleports it nearby. Hugh Jackman uses the machine to make a copy of himself, has a trapdoor that falls into a watertank and drowns the copy on the stage and comes out from wherever it teleports him. His arch nemesis Christian Bale is framed for murdering Hugh Jackman and one of the twin is hung. That's basically it. Now, the tear apart begins. Is the secret twin is just ridiculous. He's going to spend years and years and years, dressing up and hiding his twin, just for one lame magic trick that didn't even do too well? Next, His twin brother is about to be hung and he STILL doesn't come forward and say he's a twin to clear his name. Plus, they were both with the same woman and she didn't know? Next, Hugh Jackman finds out he can clone himself. Bale can pull off his trick with just his brother. Couldn't Jackman just make like two copies of himself and do the trick even better? No, the dumb ass drowns himself every time for some reason. With two copies of yourself, you don't NEED to drown yourself. Not to mention, Jackman could make copies of gold or money, and he never does. Instead, the guy drowns himself over and over again because ""He's not sure who the original is and who is the clone."" I'm pretty sure the dude that materialized out of thin air is the clone. It's totally unbelievable."
"Review of The Prestige : Wow. A ""huge"" twist that you can see coming down Main Street about an hour and a half before this slow moving, snore fest ends. And not only is the story not entertaining or surprising in any way - it's also long. Way too long.There is a good time piece atmosphere set, but who cares. ""Watching Paint Dry part 6 - this time it's water based"" may have been a better title.It wasn't all bad. There was a hot chick beside me. And the popcorn had a lot of butter.I am truly surprised that anyone found any entertainment in this film. I'm not sure if the worse part was the slow moving story, or the supposed surprise that in no way should surprise anybody. Somehow, the writers managed to make the story totally unbelievable in every way as well. Now, one may think that getting rid of reality would give the liberty to make an entertaining story - but they managed to avoid this. I guess for film students, and aspiring writers it may be a confidence booster in their own abilities."
"Review of The Prestige : If you have some IQ and haven't watched this movie yet, don't.At the beginning everyone believes that this movie is going to be brilliant and all the tricks of those magic will be explained. But no, in the end the script writer and director just slap on your face: This is a sci-fi movie you idiot! That replicator machine ruined all the suspension the movie has built in the first 2 hours. All the tricks suddenly become so cheap.It could have been much better if Angier cooperates with that double man and drown him in the end to frame Borden up. But instead, the director got you some alien or terminator machine to replicate 100 Angiers.I registered an account on IMDb just to give this movie one star. You can see how disappointed and angry i am ."
"Review of The Prestige : Fans of truly great bad acting, crushed birds, bogus history, boredom, bogus science, preening smugness and amateur amputation -- this idiotic flimflam is for you.And if you thought mining or bridge-building was a dangerous game around 1899, think again. Stage magic was apparently fatal or, at last, crippling for nearly everyone involved -- especially if you were an assistant or a canary. Might have been a sound move to avoid using blind (I am not making this up) stagehands. Playing tricks on the audience is as old as film -- perhaps the medium itself should be seen as one big trick -- but this is so clunkily done and so much is signalled in advance (just one example of many -- closeup of rope, medium shot of distraught woman, closeup of rope again, then, abracadabra, silhouette shot of human pendulum -- and watch out for anyone with a limp and of being hit over the head by repeated, blatant examples of duality).Except for Caine, Serkis (maybe) and the feline Bowie, the performers of these very unlikeable characters are cringingly inept with Hugh Jackman taking the marzipan for playing multiple roles so astoundingly badly that you wonder if he thinks great acting consists of SHOUTING while crying and, possibly, having your nose run (or was that yet another tear?). After all, I suppose, if you can't be childishly histrionic at your own wife's funeral, what's the point of turning up? And as the out-of-work actor (if only!) Jackman seems to be doing an outrageous send-up of Robert Newton (not known for his own under-playing, I think). If the idea of such cardboard cutout characters battling over who is the greater not-very-inspired magician seems a bit thin, well, you might be on to something -- at more than two hours this is wildly overlong as well as overwrought. It is also a bit hard to care who wins the ""duel"" (or how) if you think each is a boring, revolting, homicidal creep. Even the magic business is supposed to be entertaining from time to time but these guys aren't just magicians, they're psychics and so know all about tricks like Sawing a Woman in Half which, as Chris Priest knows, was invented by an illusionist called Selbit and not performed until 1921. (According to the author the dueling magicians' story ends in 1903.)And where does the sadomasochism come from? With all the gloating over gore, violent death and grime, you'd think Mel ""Mad Monk"" Gibson had had a bloody hand in this. Yet all this grimness is so very silly -- no sense of period; no sense of the theatre or of how magicians actually work; no point of view; no sense of time (which does, probably, have a kind of inexorable reality); above all, not a trace of irony or humour (though some in the audience I was in laughed when one of the ridiculous Hugh Jackman characters fell down). I suppose, though, it is rather comical if the great (offstage) villain is Thomas Edison -- in fact, he may be the Moriarty here, the Napoleon of Crime -- let's hear it for direct current.There may be an interesting movie to be made about the business of magic in the late 19th Century theatre -- but this is definitely not it. It's a typical Hollywood mess which says nothing new, makes not a whole lot of sense and assumes (perhaps correctly) that the audience is a pack of clods. The novel (as usual) makes more sense than the movie which is (as usual) the mucked-up, dumbed-down version of part of the story. While you can't set a whole novel on film (though there have been some interesting attempts) you don't need to turn it into some sort of crazy, inept pantomime set in a mortuary.Many of the changes/""improvements"" are inexplicable -- why, for example, is Rupert Angier now Robert? Murdoch-phobia?? Some are crudely for US consumption -- you try putting a pre-decimal English penny in a pistol and see how far you get!And it's full of unsubtle tricksiness such as ""AB"" (Alfred Borden) ""RA"" (Robert Angier) ""C"" (Cutter - no first name? Like Sabu or Paladin?) and for all I know there may be a ""DA"" ""BR"" ""A"" lurking somewhere - but by now who cares? This is the sort of thing that seems clever to people who don't get out too much. Perhaps someone could re-edit this dreary rubbish to transform it into a real movie; cutting out (or dubbing with a human voice) any character mugged by Mr Jackman might be an excellent starting point.But I would much rather have listened to Cutter talking the illusion business over with Tesla -- especially on precisely how you deal with the blood and the noise when you smash a live bird on a table top or how you can produce all that Tesla lightning without deafening performers and audience with Tesla thunder.Is The Illusionist any better?"
"Review of The Prestige : I hated this movie. I saw it in the theater and after it was over I just felt horrible. I was hungry but I didn't want to eat anything, I was tired but didn't want to sleep, I didn't want to talk to any of my friends, even my cigarette tasted bad. I ended up going home and washing dishes. Three or four hours later I snapped out of it but it was real downer.It's not even like the movie was depressing, I like depressing movies, I like dark movies and sad movies and horror movies. But this was something different, it was life-ruining bad. And it wasn't even that any one aspect of the film was flawed specifically, (although I particularly hated the editing) just the entire movie turned me off. I don't know what I am supposed to leave this movie with, a lot of people keep saying that the entire film is a magic trick, which would make the film's director the magician. so in the end when he outsmarts me with his twist ending, I guess I am supposed to be amazed and astounded at how clever he is, and how not clever I am. I don't know why anybody would want to see a film where the director is just flaunting his intellectual superiority over his audience.The movie is like some awful prank, like director Chris Nolan took my car keys and through them in a river."
"Review of The Prestige : It's the longest movie I've ever sit through, it felt like 9 or 10  hours at least. Nothing interesting happens, it's a story so convoluted  and stupid written only to get to the last ""shocking reveal"" that  ANYONE with half a brain would expect coming since the introduction  Caine gives about a magic trick. I wonder just how can Hollywood  believe that people are still impressed or interested in this ""usual  suspect"" trickery: come up with something else already, we don't need  to be ""fooled"", we can take a good narrative that doesn't try to  outsmart us (specially when it doesn't like in the Prestige).  And then that reveal is even dumber than you could ever imagine, not  that you wouldn't see it coming at least 30 minutes ahead, it's just  that you would hope that it's not THAT stupid and that the  writer/director would respect the audience and give something credible  or at least smart. No luck with that.  Anybody that loves movies should stay away from this crap, I'm just  glad I didn't pay to see it, but I'm sad about wasting a couple of  hours of my time with it. Save yours, go see anything else, avoid at  all costs, it is worse than Al Quaeda."
"Review of The Prestige : I'm a Hugh Jackman fan. A few years ago on a business trip to New York City,the hosting firm presented me with a top notch mezzanine seat to see him in the ""Boy from Oz."" Never did I see any single actor command a stage as he did. Hugh deserved every accolade awarded him. The show itself was quite good but Jackman was BETTER than the show. The problem is that this stage genius makes lousy movies and ""The Prestige"" proves it.First of all, it cannot compare to this years excellent ""Illusionist."" Not even close. ""Prestige"" was filmed in the dark--by that I mean every scene was dank, dark,ominous,creepy, crawly and downright annoying. I felt like I was sitting in an unlit cellar. The plot was highly confusing. The English brogues were as thick as mud and difficult to understand. The acoustics was awful. They needed Tesla like a hole in the head. All those top hats lying around ranked stupider than stupid. Novocaine was better than the usually brilliant Michael Caine. With all these doubles, maybe triples running around, I felt as if I were at a World Series game. Scarlett Johansson was just a pretty face and figure--nothing more. As far as I was concerned, the movie was nothing more than a jumbled up confusing mess unworthy of my time and money."
"Review of The Prestige : Worst script ever!!! Worst scenario ever!!! The plot is total nonsense!!! Only the performance of the actors is awesome. This movie has total lack of common sense. The ending is complete nonsense! I do not want to write spoilers here explaining the situation, but I have to - just ask yourself - if the machine was able to produce clones why Robert Anger was killed? And he also was betrayed without any reason by two people - his assistant Olivia and his friend Cutter. Does anybody want to explain why? This is more fiction than that Tesla machine - friends usually do not betray with no reason... I did not enjoy this movie because of a huge lack of a common sense..."
"Review of The Prestige : As a fan of Christopher Nolan's work on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I thought I would enjoy The Prestige as well. I was wrong. The good news is I just caught the film on Encore, so the only thing I wasted was my time.I do not fault Mr. Nolan or any of the actors (save a lacking performance by Scarlett Johansson). The real problem here is the story. Without going into detail let me just say that the movie started with an interesting premise and devolved into a ""I'm better than you"" farce between the two main characters. I sat there in disbelief as Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman (both of whom I admire) were forced to lower themselves into a story like this. One of them wrongs the other somehow, and the other then returns the favor. This is Bale's most unfortunate film role choice since Reign of Fire.Now don't get me wrong...as I said I do not fault the actors. Bale and Jackman performed as well as they could under the circumstances. However, since the story itself lost my interest, even the greatest actors in the world could not save it."
"Review of The Prestige : This movie was bad, really bad. It is longer than it should have been. It has no twists and no interesting story.At first I thought it would have been a cool movie where I enjoy the battle of wits between two magician. But this movie has none of that. It is just so predictable.The other problem I had with this movie is that it has no lovable character. Everyone is just an asshole and I don't feel like supporting any of these guys.And when you sit down and think about it, what the hell is the point of wasting your life for a stupid magic show. These character motivations make no sense, in fact the characters themselves make no sense at all. They are like robots.Bottomline, the movie is bad."
"Review of The Prestige : The prestige was god awful. The characters mumbled their lines, almost the entire movie was presented in flashback form and it makes you wanna fall asleep.As the movie started I could vaguely tell what was going on, or whether it was flashback or present, the characters mumbled their lines as if they were scared to perform As the movies plot thickens so many times and it adds so many dramatic twists that you begin to lose count and lose interest in what's going on and stop caring. The movie dredged on and on and on, I was falling asleep. As I was falling asleep I was wondering ""Why am I sitting here, I can get out and get my money back"" and so I did, but I think I should sue for lost time and embarrassment. Short summary, this movie sucked. Interesting Idea, horrible execution. I would have given it a two, but it was so long I couldn't stand it anymore, so 1."
"Review of The Prestige : Is it a sin to want have an enjoyable time when shelling out my hard earned money? Is it too much to ask to have the story make a tiny bit of sense? Am I being unreasonable to want to at identify with, or even like, at least one of a story's characters? In my humble opinion - that's not really asking for too much! When driving home from the theater, it crossed my mind that the two magicians are like Karl Rove, (the Republican party strategist and America's #1 Faustian) - they will do absolutely anything to ""win!"" As far as the story's two main character's are concerned, that means even commit murder (repeatedly in one case), or drive one's wife to suicide! Perhaps the filmmakers were attempting to drive this point home - there are people like our two magician madmen in the real world! While the word ""obsession"" is mentioned about a hundred times in this godforsaken story - it's misleading, like a magician's trick. What this film is really about can be summed up in four words - ""the banality of evil."" How ordinary people can lose track of the simplest of concepts - ""right and wrong. ""The ends don't justify the means. Being famous, powerful, ""and the best"" is not more important than love, family, community, friendship, or even one's soul! What a terribly demoralizing story! The only very small bright spot in this entirely dreary film, was bringing Nikola Tesla, the great inventor and energy theorist into the story. His genius is absolutely fascinating. Too bad most viewers will think he's a fictional character like the rest of the story, instead of an important historical figure! It's a shame the story didn't evolve around him! It would have been a tad bit more entertaining! (Put his name through any reliable search engine, and see for yourself!)"
"Review of The Prestige : It's a movie with a twist that puts it into the realm of unbelievable fantasy crap. And, had me so angry that I wish I had asked for my money back.Why not have space aliens land and be in control of the apparent show? That's how ridiculous, absurd and stupid the film is.The first twist, one magician is actually twins sacrificing their happiness for the magic is great, unpredictable and realistic. I thought the film was going to be brilliant.But, the second, that a man had discovered a replicator, and kept it hidden for his own magic trick while killing himself every night... left me so empty and angry I wish I had never seen the film. What sort of twist is that? Its not even a twist, its a departure from a good film to a very very very bad one."
"Review of The Prestige : Probably a well crafted plot, but awfully confusing visually because of the ""twins"" that appear intermittently.The cinematography is top notch, and actors are decent, so it's a quality piece no doubt, but I didn't like the story (at all). There were more sadistic meanness in each of the characters that escalated from around the middle of the movie, and then continued to no end until its (trashy) ending. I don't care if one was smarter than the other or outwitted the other. The ugliness of the confrontation got appalling to a point where intrigue didn't matter anymore. I also didn't like the audio, how sudden blast of sound got injected to make you jump up from your seats. I know it's digital, and I know that theaters have mega watt systems, but is it really necessary to crank up the volume so loud suddenly ?Nice to watch visually, but the characters and the story that goes with it were unpalatable."
"Review of The Prestige : Some movies, while lingering in your thoughts after leaving the theater, mellow like a fine wine. This turned to vinegar very quickly. The story began sensibly enough, but then quickly degenerates into an incoherent mess, as if the script was half-written when given the studio's green light, financed, and cast, then sloppily given a dopey, intelligence-insulting last written half. Having seen ""The Illusionist"", I almost thought they had attempted a poor satire of the much, much better movie. As if taking a cue from this nit-witty script, the acting, from such a star-studded cast, was amazingly half-rate. Scarlet Johanssen should not attempt a British accent ever, ever again; even Michael Caine's and Christian Bale's cockney accents were cringe-inducing and they're both British! Even with the large budget they were probably given for set design (it takes place around 1899), they still screwed this up and made it look incredibly amateurish - the scenes of Colorado Springs from a hillside made the town look like a wintertime snow-globe village. The special effects were wasted on the idiotic idea that Nicola Tesla built an energy globe that could replicate objects and, oh my God, people. All in all, a forgettable movie."
"Review of The Prestige : Okay, so everyone i know is raving about how good the prestige is. I admit myself that it looked really good on the trailers. Maybe its because i had such high expectations that i was so devastated by this terrible ending. If you've seen the movie you know the whole time everyone is questioning how the real transported man works. You keep wondering, if its not a double then HOW THE HECK IS THE TRICK DONE!?!!?!! Its a classic move, make a mystery the whole movie, and then when the explanation comes at the end everyone is amazed. This should be how it works. But the prestige ignores all convention and lays down that terrible terrible ending. The whole point of the movie is that you wonder how the trick is done. Then when they reveal it you are expecting some really cool trick. ""how does the man make his body transport?"" for some reason the answer to that question is: He simply clones himself and drowns himself every night! DUH! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Im expecting some cool trick and the explanation of how he does the impossible trick is that he does an equally impossible thing. Thats not an explanation thats just another impossible thing. Thats like me making a movie where a certain person can come back from the dead and saying ""okay the trick is that he can time travel and just avoid his original death!"" ""get it? i explained it for u!!!"" Okay well because of that i gave it a 3, it got a 3 cuz the movie was good but the ending was a big let down."
"Review of The Prestige : Anyone with taste shouldn't attend a film with either Jackman, Johansson, or Bale, or directed by Nolan. Anyone with a brain would have seen the end coming an hour before the end comes. Chopped-up editing. Confused narration. Historically inaccurate. Very long. Boring cinematography. Studio movie 100 percent. Something has to blow up every 5 minutes to please the audience. The makers don't know if they're directing fiction or historical period piece. Maybe the only thing to save from the film is Bowie, walking through the screen like an alien-life form, with the same distinctive walk we have seen so many times in films (Twin Peaks, the Man Who Fell to earth, ...). David Lynch once wanted to make a film about Nikola Tesla, and Nolan asking Bowie to be him is maybe a nod to the project, but sadly it fails to portray anyone, or anything, in a convincing manner...And all this looks like it's been done and seen before a thousand times."
"Review of The Prestige : There is something Quentin Tarantino always says that I couldn't help apply to The Prestige. In a lot of interviews, he mentioned that most movies anymore aren't even stories, but rather a single circumstance that the director just lives up to for two hours. And that's exactly the problem The Prestige and every other Nolan film has. Nolan just takes one boring concept, then attempts to stretch it out into a long-winded, boring movie by use of his watered-down metafiction directing style. If The Prestige would have been the idea of any other director, they would have at least added SOMETHING to the one-track story or cut it down to half the time so it would have at least been slightly less tedious to sit though.The Prestige opens up with the single least interesting first hour I've ever witnessed in a film. Is there anything whatsoever that was even remotely meant to hold my attention? From the severely uninteresting opening, the movie tries hard to redeem itself with a middle ""twist"" that is too shallow to be called a true plot twist. Simply put, it's a weird sci-fi insert and nothing more. I have nothing against that, but one semi-interesting plot point can't save a pointless movie from being pointless. By the predictable ending, all the scenes that made no sense before make sense. I assume this is a style Nolan finds clever, but it got old after Memento. In The Prestige it's simply annoying, if not a bit childish. It's used here as a way to force an uninteresting plot into something that is watchable by indulging the viewer in cliché mystery. And I predictable and analyzed everything I just said above in the first ten minutes alone. Ironic, isn't it, that Nolan tries so hard to unpredictable but the very storytelling method he uses gives himself away. Christopher Nolan is a lot like an immature little kid trying to impress an old magician with a cheap coin trick. It's amusing and cute at most.The other main problem with The Prestige is it lacks anything whatsoever even slightly original. The one-line plottwo dueling magicianshas been used in everything from multiple CSI episodes to cartoons like Scooby Doo to old classic horror Hitchcock Presents episodes. The sci-fi insertI won't spoil what it ishas been done before in other movies time and time again. The dramatic scenes are all as cliché and predictable as possible. All the fanboys who are calling The Prestige even remotely original really make me laugh.The acting is decent on all fronts, and sometimes borders on cheesy when some of the actors forget their accents half-way through. The directing is somewhat stylish, but nothing that held my attention or is anywhere above average.But above all, the main flaw is by far the fact that 2/3rds of the entire movie is irrelevant to the plot or to anything whatsoever. It's just a bunch of old men repeating the same lines about magic tricks over and over to the point of nausea. I don't have the strongest attention span, but I can certainly sit through a slow-paced movie when the slow pacing actually has something to do with the story. For example, the original 1970s Alien had a complete hour of seemingly irrelevant screen time, but it used that to build atmosphere. Here, in The Prestige, you have an hour and a half of screen time devoted to nothing but hearing old men talk about things that make no difference. It doesn't build atmosphere; it bores. I was already screaming, ""Does it EVER end?"" at the screen before I was even halfway through, and that is simply ridicules.Overall, The Prestige is a completely pointless watch because you've seen it all beforein half the time. It's cliché, painfully boring, and ultimately pointless: all staples of Christopher Nolan's film making.0/10"
"Review of The Prestige : So. This movie has a cumulative rating of 8.5. It is about magicians/illusionists. One of the great things about watching magicians/illusionists is trying to figure out how they do their tricks/illusions. The movie and reviewers say watch carefully, and, watch the movie again, to see what the tricks/illusions are and try to figure out how they are done. There is just one big fat problem with all that. You can't see anything. The director, cinematographer, and lighting guy are of the silly conceit that period movies should be heard but not seen. The lighting guy analogized to Hitchcock, but there is just one problem with that. With Hitchcock, you might not be able to understand exactly what was going on, you might not be able to figure out what was going on, but you could always see what was going on. I don't understand. The budget for this thing was $40 mill. and they decided to keep people from seeing what they spent their money on. It might have been a decent movie, but it is so dark, you can't see anything, so, what was the point in making the movie. There certainly isn't much point in trying to watch it. Let's face it, a dark black screen isn't that exciting and doesn't hold viewer interest. The big Prestige at the end? You can't see what leads up to it so it doesn't shock, surprise, or matter. 8.5? Can't see it. 1."
"Review of The Prestige : Why Christopher Nolan's movies are so popular? Until you understand that, you will continue to wonder why people spend a lot of money and time to be imprisoned into dull and boring movies; Christopher Nolan knows exactly what he's doing, and he's known it from the start. And what's that he's got for you? A prefabricated universe dominated by figures with no soul and lungs: his audience likes the excitement of drowning their little imagination again and again; for them, films have to be that deadening and useless - and once they have watched them, they might say 'that was really good' a great many time before they get reanimated - lol! that is all right, because their understanding is so nimble to realize their error, which will be forgotten much more quickly than a dream."
"Review of The Prestige : I HATED this film. From the mumbling bumbling dialog to the so-called ""twisted"" ending.... Did not know who was who... so you all say that what was great about it.... I didn't think so. I found it very hard to follow. Worst movie I've seen in a long time. Did not know what was going on, past, present or future....who knows. I had a very difficult time understanding what Christian Bale was saying, they all spoke so softly, plus the accents! The movie ended and all I could say was what a waste of time. It was way too long too! Save yourself a lot of thinking and see The Illusionist! Much, much better movie, better acting and very entertaining!"
"Review of The Prestige : I can't seem to find a ""minus"" number on the review score, and believe me, I tried hard to find a way to get one for this profoundly overrated insult to the intellect and sensibilities. I see a lot of movies. I usually like movies that make me think. I usually like movies with plot twists. I usually like movies with suspense. Notice I did NOT say I usually like movies that make me THINK I want my time back, movies with more plot HOLES than the even astronomical amount of plot TWISTS, or movies that force me to SUSPEND disbelief light years beyond preposterous. That's not quite what I had in mind when I made my ultimately embarrassing decision to watch this movie, or worse yet, subject my wife to it as well. It's not enough to apologize to my wife...I apologize to all spouses everywhere, and I STILL don't feel cleansed. Oh. Did I mention that this waste of both the U.S. and British economies is unrelentingly and disturbingly dark? Hmmmm. Lemme think...which character did I care about LESS. Impossible to decide, because I COULDN'T have cared less. Ya know...wait a minute, that's not fair. It's not the ACTORS I didn't care about. It was the writers, director, and producer of this insult to humanity whose feelings I refuse to spare. How did this movie ever get conjured up??? The term ""Movie Magic"" is perfectly antithetical here, although The Prestige DOES succeed in getting your brain to disappear. The fact that this got an 8.5 rating on IMDb is either a parlor trick or a typo. At least I hope so, anyway. If not, I weep for the future, and will despondently have to dismiss all future ratings without exploring the ""Hated it"" reviews first. Honey, if you're reading this...I love you, I didn't mean to hurt you, and please forgive me. In fact, YOU get to pick the next one. Don't worry, darling, WHATEVER it is, it'll seem like The Godfather to me after this."
"Review of The Prestige : This masterpiece very hard to follow, to summarize, is a true gem which only the like of Christopher Nolan could deliver us. And the cast is also terrific for this movie that I can say it is the best films ever made concerning magic and also rivalry. There is not real good or evil character here, just rivalry and many elements that make it riveting, tense, suspense packed, where you deal with so many twists that you can get easily drowned - as the Hugh Jackman's character in the water tank. Michael Caine is also marvelous in this movie, as he is also in other BATMAN franchise from the director."
Review of The Prestige : in the beginning the movie seems to be a competition between two magicians.i thought it would be very interesting to see that what new tricks of magic they will discover to make them self better than other and how they will ruin each others trick after reavling the truth behind that tricks in front of audience.but i disappoint when an unreal trick came to movie.it totally changed the plot of movie.how they can do this to a good going movie.this trick was about to make a duplicate of anything in a machine.so we suddenly enter in a fantasy or sci-fic world from a real world and this reveals after mid of the movie.so this is also a fantasy and sci-fic genre movie.
"Review of The Prestige : Fallon is a clone. bottom line.When Alfred explains to Fallon to ""leave Angier alone"", Fallon does not listen. The reason? Because Fallon had NO IDEA how the transported man was done. He didn't realize that he was a clone, and had no concept of there even being a possibility of making a clone. Thats why Fallon went behind Alfred's back to see how the secret works. You didn't see Alfred going to see how the trick worked because he already knew the secret. Thats why when Fallon is in prison and he's walking away from Alfred on his way to death he says that ""he should have left Angier alone"". Basically my belief is that when Alfred made his clone he never explained to Fallon that he was actually a clone, but maybe a brother."
"Review of The Prestige : ...that's why I saw - yes, actually saw - that Fallon was a twin...geez, why couldn't he tell his wife (whoever's...;-))? ...that's why I was reminded again why I don't like ""magic"" tricks at all, never have....give me some Hogwarts magic instead anytime! Or real science fiction.This could have stayed in the real world with maybe using the lookalike and then killing HIM off as revenge - but no, they had to make poor Nicola Tesla into something he was not...Nice cinematography, and I happen to like Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman (and Michael Caine of course, THAT goes without saying...check out Harry Brown!), and I think Rebecca Hale is sooo much the better actress than Scarlett Johanssen, so I was entertained, but not really fooled...no, I did not see everything coming, but the main points --- the diary stunt was actually a smooth one! One of the best films I've ever seen? Hardly. Not much substance imho, really good films have an impact on your life, you take something home from them.This one just leaves me with the image of a squashed bird...and that was only the first of a number of superfluous deaths..."
"Review of The Prestige : OK, im not saying i didn't like this movie, as a matter of fact i loved it, cause we could learn something from this, its a moral kinda thing. Here is my point of view:Twin #2 i don't think his twin brother wanted to get executed at all.Twin #1 he risked everything and everyone,by losing the one he loved (his wife suicide), destroyed his daughters life (no mommy) and let die the one that stood by his side all the time until the end (twin #2 executed), just to get back his prestige? and after killing his rival what? I think he lost more in life, than what he really gained, he gained prestige but lost happiness. I say the hell with it, why not answer the damn question instead, why did you tie that motherfu_king knot? how hard can that be,lol"
"Review of The Prestige : The Prestige tells the story of two rival magicians in the nineteenth century,Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman). Before becoming rivals they worked together for a magician but one night Angier's wife died performing one of the tricks and Angier blamed Borden. From that point on both individuals become accomplished and successful magicians and trough the years they try to steal each other tricks often interfering with one another shows.They get more obsessed, more envious and end up playing a very dangerous game...I found The Prestige to be a highly entertaining film. The magicians obsession in topping one another and the extreme lengths they go to do so, make this rivalry very interesting to watch.The story is full of twists and turns,most of them unexpected.Both Jackman and Bale delivered good performances and the movie was well directed.Near the end answers are provided to the two biggest secrets in the movie but they might not please everyone.I guessed one of the answers but the other one, I never saw it coming and some might feel cheated. Also it might not seem that way but this is a very complex movie and after watching it you should read the faq on the movie page.8/10"
"Review of The Prestige : At the turn of the century, Robert Anger (Hugh Jackman), his wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) work as assistants to the magician Cutter (Michael Caine). Due to arrogance, Julia dies during one of the tricks. This sparks an obsessive rivalry between Angier and Borden that ends in their eventual destruction. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson play other love interests.It's a tight twisted plot. If you have solved it to the end, then you are much smarter than me. Christopher Nolan and his brother weave an intriguing tale of obsession and revenge. The twists and turns will leave you stunned. The revelations of tricks are amazing. There is nothing more breathtaking than this movie.In a way, rewinding isn't really necessary. This further confuses the complex story. It's too much. Perhaps it would be better to make the film more straightforward. Personally, I like the challenge."
Review of The Prestige : The movie is real good until a point where they completly destroy the entire story by introducing what can only be described as pure bs and just pretend it is okay it completly destroys the suspension of disbelief and for another hour or so you just sit astonished wondering how anyone could possibly think that this was a good direction to take the movie i really don't uderstand how all of theese actors that can only be described as some of the best in the world would consider working on this movie save your time and don't waste a single second of your life watching this utter piece of garbage.
"Review of The Prestige : Well, i was reluctant to rent this movie as the story didn't appeal very much to my tastes : however, now, after watching it, i found it good, not exceptional or prestigious but better than the actual trend : Nolan is indeed a great director as he knew how to grasp my attention since the first minutes : The art direction is rather excellent with big theaters, stages and all the feel of the « Victorian » era. All the cast is at the same level : Wolvie, Batman, black widow Even the second parts are well filled : Perabo, Gollum, David Bowie, Michael Caine and for sure Rebecca Hall! The story is not as linear and simple as i feared : it's full of twists and flashbacks so we better pay attention and this competition between those two is rather violent, absolute and in a way, sad and tragic..."
"Review of The Prestige : Review: A tale of two magicians and a rivalry that gets out of hand. Get ready to step in the magicians world with a wonderfully crafted and gothic inspired movie by the brilliant Christopher Nolan. However the unique plot structure demands that you pay very close attention to the movie because you can easily get lost if you don't.Takeaways:-Every Magic Trick consists of Three Parts or ActsI-The Pledge:The Magician introduces the ordinary.-we are introduced to the main characters Robert Angier,(Hugh Jackman) Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). Two magicians that embark on their careers.-The sets look just like Victorian Era London England.-Bale and Jackman do phenomenal jobs with their main roles.-Sir Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, and Rebecca Hall are also great in their supporting roles.II-The Turn:The Magician turns the ordinary into the extrodianary.-The two magicians become bitter rivals after one loses his wife, and the other loses his finger. Angier tries to find out how Borden gets his teleporting trick to work. But instead, Angier plagiarizes off of Borden and creates a bigger more scientific version of his trick with help from Nikolai Tesla (David Bowie)III-The Prestige: The Big twists and turns.-The reveals of Angier copying himself and Borden
Actually being twin brothers (one of them was the associate Fallon) was phenomenal and helped to make the ending much more satisfying!"
"Review of The Prestige : One of Christopher Nolan's early works. I like the characteristics of his film and themes which is 'time', and 'Prestige' was what I wanted to watch.Of course there were some shuffling but This film is not about time. It was his essay of creator. He showed it to us as two magicians. He started his career with his brother which corresponds to Alfred Borden. In this film, two magicians are entertainers as well as artisan which corresponds to Nolan himself who is a filmmaker as well as artisan. However, because of an accident, they starts to defeat each other. Borden is by too much artisan spirit, Angier who is another main character, is by resentment, they deal with the devil, according to them 'getting their hands dirty'. In the end, they have the last 'duel'.I like the scene that Sarah said 'When you love me more than magic...' a lot, which symbolises how Nolan is and how he think of films.All actors were really good. Of course Christian Bale who acted two characters, Hugh Jackman who acted two completely different characters, Scarlett Johansson and Michael Cain. Even there wasn't a lot of his part, David Bowie was unforgettable.I like films about how the creator think of creating, and the story about the people who deal with the devil. But this film was not only that. I was satisfied with that the clever screenplay using two diaries, covert references and twist in the end."
"Review of The Prestige : The Prestige is a 2006 British-American mystery thriller film directed by Christopher Nolan, from a screenplay adapted by Nolan and his brother Jonathan from Christopher Priest's 1995 novel of the same name. Its story follows Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, rival stage magicians in London at the end of the 19th century. Obsessed with creating the best stage illusion, they engage in competitive one-upmanship with tragic results. The film stars Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, Christian Bale as Alfred Borden, and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. It also stars Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, Andy Serkis, and Rebecca Hall. The film reunites Nolan with actors Bale and Caine from Batman Begins and returning cinematographer Wally Pfister, production designer Nathan Crowley, film score composer David Julyan, and editor Lee Smith.The film was released on October 20, 2006, receiving positive reviews and strong box office results, and received Academy Award nominations for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. Along with The Illusionist and Scoop, The Prestige was one of three films released in 2006 to explore the world of stage magicians."
"Review of The Prestige : The movie lacks understanding. the characters are though jumbling from one scene to another but, unable to reach the conclusion. Hugh Jackman knows that Christian Bale is onlooking the task of stealing magic, but still he clarifies in the movie that he is the only one who can perform better magic. But at last he dies and Bale thinks he is alive. in the end Bale is only the survivor who lives and Hugh Jackman dies, but, in the actual view Bale is original villain who kills Jackman's wife and finds himself against Jackman. the story line is quite boring and if there are certain philosophical remakes in the movie, they are hidden and everyone thinks that performing magic is real task and prolongs killings. Michael Kane is the real idiot in the movie who goes around the stage and clarifies with the audience that Bale and Jackman are the only magicians who know how to perform magic."
"Review of The Prestige : Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" which was published in the year 2000,is the kind of movie upon which Hollywood once built its reputation but rarely produces anymore.It contained gorgeous scenery,impressive set design,and an epic storyline. Russell Crowe is Maximus, a popular general in the emperor Marcus Aurelius's army, who begins the film by winning a great and bloody battle against the Deutch hordes thus securing the roman borders. We learn from this victory that his troops love him, as does the aging emperor (Richard Harris), who asks Maximus to take over in Rome and root out the mercenaries who are corrupting the place. But the emperor already has a son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who is a self-indulgent, cowardly layabout, with hints of an incestuous relationship with his sister. After that, Commodus, learning of the emperor's decision to name Maximus and not him as the next ruler, kills his father and orders Maximus killed. But because the movie still has another two hours to run, the killers are foiled and Maximus survives."
"Review of The Prestige : Okay, saw the movie the 20th of October and loved it! I'd suggest though...if you saw the movie and didn't like it...then you need to read the book...it gives a better appreciation for it. I'd ALSO like to point out that Angier's first name is NOT ROBERT it's RUPERT! Okay...had to get that out...well I'd give the movie a 10/10. I *heart* Hugh Jackman. (But that's not why I loved it!) OH! In the book....Rupert didn't get shot. Julia didn't drown and Sarah didn't hang herself. but oh well.Geez...you have to make this ten lines.... This is hard. Why won't it let me send my comment yet? Grr...so you don't have to keep reading. I'm just trying to waste space."
"Review of The Prestige : Here's what I think. I don't know if it's already been stated, but I'm sending it anyway.The first time Angier ""transported"" himself he did transport himself, leaving the clone behind. That's what I gather from the scene, because it seems that the clone picked up the gun as Angier was trying to explain that he was the real one, but was shot before he could finish. So from then on out the clones died. That explains the reason why at the end when Borden is down there Angier is so shocked from drowning. Yes, it could all be part of the frame up, or he could just be freaking out because he was in fact drowning. And that's got to suck. But you'd think after the first time of going through that, if it was him who was dying every night and not the clone, he'd figure out a different way. So go ahead. Tear me apart."
"Review of The Prestige : Not expecting a great stuff, I was not disappointed.Like the Illusionist (same year), this is not one I did like a lot.One month separated the public coming out of these movies Once seen, is enough... (I even preferred the Illusionist, though in it the acting was like a tasteless menu)Yes, the Prestige's acting and cast is much better than in The Illusionist, and the machinery is interesting, but for me, the supposed magic didn't work.Good acting and decorum seldom save a whole movie...The script is too complicated, and twisting a lot for an poor result...Not very funny, insisting on special effect...In fact what I appreciated was the acting as i wrote before, good if not top notch...The rest: ""bof"" ... the french interjection perfectly describe my appreciation!So, the same year, with an interval of a month, two ""magic films"" came out, at least for me (knowing the IMDb voters top marks for both!) for a so-so result : it must be the law of series...Fortunately, after expecting much pleasure from the Illusionist, and in fact was just a passable OK saying, for this one my hopes were lowered : it corresponded to what I got..."
"Review of The Prestige : Nolan's 'The Prestige' is full of magic and surprises. Based on Christopher Priest's absorbing novel, Nolan brings it to life on screen. The story develops from interesting premise about two magicians, who were once friends, now turned into rivals. But the strength of the storytelling lies in how the events unfold with its twists and turns, keeping the viewer in sheer suspense and wonder while at the same time never losing its main focus. The director has an eye for visuals and almost each and every frame of the movie is very intricately detailed. The film is set during some time in the Victorian era but I liked that it still felt contemporary rather than a period piece. Yet, that is not to say that the art direction does not deserve mention. Quite the contrary because toning it down had a brilliantly subtle effect. Likewise, the cinematography too is effectively downplayed. The score flows smoothly. Hugh Jackman delivers one of his best works to date. The actor is simply excellent as the caring and easy-going turned into ambitious, competitive and vengeful magician. Christian Bale too is impressive while Michael Caine almost always knows how to deliver a memorable performance and here he's no different. Scarlett Johanssen is quite forgettable while Rebecca Hall fairs better and Piper Perabo shines in a small role. 'The Prestige' is one of Nolan's best (along with his debut 'Memento') movies. Not only because it's spectacular to look at but it has all that I look for in a movie experience."
Review of The Prestige : This is a really fun film. A (deadly) rivalry between two magicians poses the question of how far someone will go for their craft? There are fun twists and turns.

"Review of The Prestige : What was his part at the end of the movie??? All through the movie, he is friends with Hugh Jackman. What did he know about Borden in the end???? Did he help him somehow in killing Hugh Jackman?? I'm really confused. He was not going to approve of what Hugh Jackman was planning for Borden, so he tried to keep him out of it. Also, what were they trying to show at the very end of the movie, they showed Hugh laying on the floor dead, then they show a clone or whatever of him, standing somewhere else, what was that?I thought they were twins, just by how upset he was when he found out he was buried underground, and I never suspected he had a twin. Even though I am confused about the whole thing because he gave Jackman the name of the man to build his cloning machine. Where did that come from? But he did show up at Jackman's performance to see how he was doing the whole trick, why would he want to see how he did it, if he was suppose to already know? It just does not add up."
"Review of The Prestige : I thought this movie was great. Although originally, I thought the story sounded dull, the writer was able to make this movie flow well and maintain my interest.The twist of the duplicating machine and the twin brother took me completely by surprise, though I know I should have seen it coming. The suspense and depth to the movie helped keep me intrigued and thinking about it after the movie.The one issue I had with the movie was the teleportation/duplication device. Up until then, the movie, seemed pretty realistic. Despite this, I feel the magic device helped really spice things up and I don't think it would have been the same without it. Perhaps it was a double-edged sword.Overall his descent into anger and jealousy and loss of his woman helped make the movie much more intense."
"Review of The Prestige : I must have watched this movie a 100 times bye now... its an awesome experience and shows the pure genius in Nolan. The movie is perfect in the sense it has a great story, portrayed by an immensely talented cast and directed by a genius... after this movie i ve become the biggest fan of Christian bale.The movie is all about the fight between 2 magicians and the quest of Angier to figure out the secret of the trick named ""the transporter man"". The movie successfully rides multiple story lines simultaneously and merges them beautifully at the end... The twist in the climax scene was breathtakingly awesome..No other suspense movie (usual suspects,6th sense, the illusionist) noting will be close enough to give a competition...Its a 10/10 and a must watch movie for anyone who loves sensible cinema."
"Review of The Prestige : For me, if the story is good, or at least believable, the script decent and the actors/actresses know their trade, then all that is required from the director - of not *ucking it up - is to just follow the script.Everything else is more or less masturbation with the aesthetics. Granted, if the form is fitting, we'll probably like it even better. Still, if you manage those three things, it should work even without a music or a set to speak of (à la ""Dogville"").While Nolan's story in interesting, it fails to be believable in the end.Nolan loves movies with a twist. And honestly, who doesn't? The problem is, such movies really only work once.I can't help but feel that movies like ""The Prestige"", ""The Sixth Sense"", and so on, are little more than a waste of perfectly good celluloid... In retrospect (at the very least), one always has to shake her head in disbelief. To insist that Bruce Willis - or anyone else for that matter - could go on living a day without realizing that he is actually dead, is an insult to our intellect. You wouldn't need to plss or shlt anymore? Go shopping for food? You wouldn't notice people walking right through you on the streets?There are some exceptions. ""The Blair Witch Project"" was kinda fun to watch again because it has that real-life documentary feel to it. The trio's reactions/emotions ring so true. The scene where one of them confesses that he ditched the map in frustration, is timeless.But back to Nolan.I liked the mood he created in ""Insomnia"", even if that may have had more to do with solid performances given by Williams and Pacino - and the midnight Sun.My memories about ""Memento"" have grown vague, but I do remember enjoying it all those years ago. Don't know how I would feel about it today, though.But you'd figure if a movie is any good, you'd remember it, right?Still, ""Memento"" is the only Nolan movie I've cared to watch again. ""Batman Begins"" had absolutely nothing to remember it by. But it probably looked really cool. I don't think any director would be pleased hearing comments like these.Even though I haven't seen ""Inception"" or ""The Dark Knight"", I fear neither of them will make me really appreciate Nolan as a director who has something worthwhile to say. And if South Park's ""Insheeption"" is anything to go by, it's safe to assume that his notion of great cinema probably differs from mine on some crucial level.""The Prestige"", of course, had it's moments, but for me it failed for a couple of reasons. First, I couldn't really bring myself to care much about any of the main characters. I fear Bale is more or less Keanu Reeves 2.0 and Scarlett Johansson is just a poor man's Kate Winslet.There, I said it.Worse than that, when a walk-on (Bowie, whom I did not recognize) is far more interesting than anything else in the movie, you know someone blew it royally.And second, to wrap it up with something as inane as cloning is just bad writing. So, instead of leaving us with a lingering feeling of mystery, we're simply ordered to eat up this poor excuse for a science fiction and asked to feel satisfied about it nonetheless.I think ""The Prestige"" wants itself taken far too seriously. All in all it's a good fun ride, just not all the way. A ride I don't feel like repeating.PS. For the record, and since _everyone_ compares these two, I cared immensely more about the characters in ""The Illusionist"", and the ending was much more satisfying, too: you could either reason it, or you could just believe there's some magic after all... Nothing else to it for a mission accomplished.PS2. And Nolan, if you really want to tell us a story about Tesla, feel free to do so. We have your interest, and we have an actor for the part as well."
