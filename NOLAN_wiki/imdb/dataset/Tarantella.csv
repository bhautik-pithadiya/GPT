0,"This was back when Mr. Nolan was almost teenager, back in 1986. And its one of Nolans first short films. It was actually a bit hard for me to really understand what was going on, but something about a man having nightmares of another man(Nolan himself). It was fun to see this when you think about where Nolan is to this day. And it show that anyone can get to the top just like Nolan."
1,"For an initial film experience made by future Batman director Christopher Nolan along with Roko Belic, ""Tarantella"" is a curious and creative
horror short where the force of images and its combination of elements intrigue audiences. In it, a young man (Jonathan Nolan, the director's brother)
has a series of nightmares revolving strange scenarios, spiders and a Mephisto-like character (Chris himself). How much of the nightmare was just part
of his sleep or if it was actually real is the main attraction in its series of events rather than an actual plot.Nevermind its indie-style common for first-timers behind camera, that's quite a charm in this project where a group of friends gather up to challenge themselves
in making a movie, one must admire the great sense of originality put together, it is all very authentic. I was fascinated for a long time, and slightly
terrified - there's a great use of sounds and unusual angles while filming the obscure room where the man sleeps and the surroundings. And gotta love
that late 1980's aesthetics.And it makes me wonder why Nolan hasn't returned to the horror genre since he's very skillfull in creating original scenarios,
as evidenced by the adventures/sci-fi as ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"" and ""Tenet"", and also for being a master in technique. He could really pull off some
ground-breaking horror movie. ""Tarantella"" proves that with great effect. 8/10."
2,"Still looks and sounds very good for a short film that was lost for 32 years and the limits of the technology of the time and probably 0 budget, lots of spiders and stuff i dont really know what this was about but its 4 minutes long so can't really complain about that.The sound is also better than expected, they actually put some thought into it which is nice and the visual effects at the beginning and the glass shot is very cool looking. I don't really have much more to say about that I'm trying to hit the minimum review character lengthcrazy to think that guy with the crazy hair in this would end up making one of my favourite movies."
