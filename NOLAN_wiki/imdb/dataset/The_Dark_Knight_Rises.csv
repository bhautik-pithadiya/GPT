If you liked the two preceding films, I figure you'll love this one, I'm a fan of all three, this is my personal favourite.It's a long movie, but it flies by at a canter, no single frame is wasted, it moves by at a terrific pace, it has incredible action sequences, but the story is terrific.It's really interesting to see Batman coming in from a position where he's decided and feared, he's no longer accepted as Gotham's hero and saviour.Christian Bale is the perfect Batman, and he is matched every step of the way by Tom Hardy. Hardy is off the charts as Bane, the last time we saw the character was back in The Batman and Robin film, perhaps best forgotten, here though he's an iconic villain.I can't speak highly enough of Bale and Hardy, but this is also, I think the best of Anne Hathaway, she is excellent here.A decade on, and this film is still fabulous.10/10."
1,"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch. The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum. In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10"""
2,"I think as a film stand point, the dark knight is a better movie that is better acted and tense the whole way through. The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn't be possible. I've not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can't compliment this movie enough. If you haven't someone seen this trilogy yet....watch it, you won't be disappointed."
3,"The Dark Knight Rises capped off what is probably the best comic book related trilogy of movies of all time. Earlier in the series you had Batman Begins and The Dark Knight with this just being the perfect way to finish off the series.Since the last movie it's been 7 years and Batman has been in seclusion since then. Christian Bale returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne. A new villain has emerged that being the menacing Bane played by the great Tom Hardy.The supporting cast has returning members like Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine in addition to new members like Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Marion Cotillard and Anne Hathaway.The movie has a running time of about 2 hours and 45 minutes but it doesn't seem like it at all, the movie flows like a 2 hour movie."
4,"The Dark Knight Rises was an outstanding end to what has been the best trilogy I have ever seen.The film to me sums up what the batman stands for, the belief that someone can turn their leaf and become better, the belief that the fear that posses a person can be be destroyed or even help that person rise. what Christopher Nolan has given us in The Dark Knight Rises is not a lazy movie, it's a movie that makes the audience think because for me i had to watch the film many times until i have fully understand what has happened, and isn't that what makes a good movie when we have to watch it again and again and again.lets move on to the acting and the star man Christian Bale who again amazes me with his portrayal of Bruce Wayne, because even though we don't see a lot of the dark knight i personally am okay with that because i like seeing the real Bruce Wayne dealing with problems without the batman costume. another star man was Tom Hardy as Bane, ""scary"" yes, ""intimidating"" yes, ""witty"" yes and this list can go on. the thing that tipped it was that we can only see his eyes, to me he was only acting with his menacing eyes that just captivates any audience. Anne Hathaway as catwomen was a perfect cast as she brings the zing to the film, she's elegant and yet sexy at the same time, which was perfect casting. perfect casting all round including obviously Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Blake (robin).The Dark Knight Rises give audiences nearly three hours of pure excitement, for me i wanted it to continue for another three hours, the film was so good i had to watch the next day because it had every element of what makes a good batman film, such as the villain (bane) because he was the physical match for batman not like the other phenomenal batman films which was more psychotic villains. a good love story that doesn't bore the audience and a great ending. overall this was the ultimate ending to an ultimate trilogy which is a must watch. once again Christopher Nolan has done something special."
5,"Wow. That's all I can say. I was freaked out about this movie, because I loved the first two. Too often have I gotten into a series, then been horribly disappointed by the last entry (e.g. the hunger games. I hated the third book). That being said, even though I was nervous, I still had high expectations. And it exceeded those. The acting was excellent, consistently to the previous movies. The action was good. The story was great. The characters were diverse and interesting, and despite the longevity of this film, it wasn't too slow at all. This movie was a emotional roller coaster. The ending ( here's where the spoilers start) was extremely sad, but ironically, that was really good. One thing i was nervous about was that the ending would be a typical superhero movie ending: happy because the main bad guy dies or gets arrested or whatever. This wasn't that. Ask anyone who knows me well; I'm a very stoic guy, but this almost had me in tears. (Of course, it could have been the fact that this part came around at 3 AM and my mind wasn't working right.) Basically, an awesome film. My sole complaint was ( another spoiler here ) Bane's death. I'll give it this: it was realistic. I expected his death to be a long, drawn out sentimental thing, but in reality, his head got blown off in a flash. At first, I thought it was stupid, but it's sorta more realistic. Considering it's a superhero movie, anyway.If you're worried that this will ruin the series for you, don't be. I loved this movie. I don't know if it's as good as the Dark Knight, but if not, it's very, very close. Watch it. Do yourself a favor."
6,"After watching Dark Knight Rises I concluded that if there is anybody who can make kick-ass sequels its Nolan. The film contains everything, from brilliant acting, raw action, out of the world one-liners and amazing cinematography. It is already very hard to make a sequel for a film which was just good enough hit but to make a sequel for a film which will always be remembered as the best you have to do a very impeccable job and that is what is done in this movie. From the beginning to the end you have some very beautiful and emotional scenes like the mob fight between the police and the thugs, the rise of the Batman from the prison and the chants ""Deshi Deshi Basura Basura"" towards the end where Alfred and Bruce see each other for probably the last time and both know that he has made it."
7,"Christopher Nolan has outdone himself with this one. At 3.30 in the morning, I was tired. Just getting out of it, I've never been so awake. Perhaps what set this film apart from his other films was that it had a genuine emotional heartbeat. I felt that this was a flaw of Nolan's other films - the vision of emotion was there, but it was hollow. In this I bought it. I felt it, hero and villain alike.Christian Bale was typically brilliant as Batman, and I felt that Bruce Wayne was more heavily embraced in this final installment. Bale added emotional depth to the character - a plot point that I think went astray in The Dark Knight - picking up from the development made in Batman Begins.Tom Hardy as Bane was quite simply, terrifying. No longer a dunderhead ""enforcer"", but one of the criminal masterminds behind ""Gotham's Reckoning"", coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send shivers down your spine.Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle defied my expectations. Hands up who was not entirely convinced that that girl from the Princess Diaries could handle an intensely physical role like Catwoman. But here I am, hugely impressed. She added immeasurably to the value of the film.Marion Cotillard fulfilled the role of Miranda Tate admirably, though I suspect this was the most underdeveloped character of the film - though after watching, I can see why.The unsung hero of The Dark Knight Rises is Michael Caine as Alfred. A heartfelt performance that helps drive the emotional content of the film, helping Nolan sell his most well-rounded film to date. Caine's performance in both presence and absence.Special mention goes to Joseph Gordon Levitt, who is consistently proving himself to be a big player in the Hollywood game. His role as officer Blake felt like there could've been more, but it may just have come all a bit much. It was a great performance, and Levitt sunk his teeth into role. If you can, go see this in IMAX. If any film was to sell the format to skeptics, The Dark Knight Rises would be IT. I'm happy Nolan stuck to his guns and shot in 2D. 3D would have been unnecessary. I suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever reads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I've never been so envious, jealous in all my life. It's a film that leaves me floundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near this ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.From here, I'm not sure what to expect of the future. Does our imagination carry us forward, or do the studios? Time will tell.10/10"
8,"I had the honor of watching TDKR during a screening and was completely blown away! Christopher Nolan's third film in his Batman trilogy doesn't disappoint. The movie is incredibly well made, its huge production is quite breathtaking to view. This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The movie's score high-lites many of its incredible scenes, and at times, it takes your breath away.The film featured excellent performances, by all the cast. Christian Bale, as always is great as Batman. Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became ""Catwoman"", just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain ""Bane"" completely shattered my expectations. One of the best superhero movie villains, I've ever seen. The terror caused by him, is completely believable and quite menacing. Marlion Cotilliard, Michael Cane, Gary Oldman, and others all did well in their respective roles. Now I know most will miss Heath Ledger as the Joker.(I know I do) I hope people don't compare Tom Hardy's performance to Heath Ledger's, its completely unfair and the two characters are very different. Just read the comics.The colossal size of the film is a spectacle to behold, but surprisingly you don't get lost with all the explosions and extravagant action scenes, like in other films,(AKA Transformers, or POTC.) If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after almost 3 hours that I had spent in a cramped seat, but that's just how I am. However the ending is just fantastic, so emotional and bring the trilogy to a very satisfying end.Sorry if I'm being all fan-boyish and kissing this movie's behind, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favorites but generally this seems to be the movie event of this year. As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in superhero story telling and summer-blockbusters."
9,"The best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to happen and why.This movie is bigger than the previous two, far more ambitious. There are no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films in general, especially blockbuster action movies. All of Nolan's movies have deep psychological themes and this takes those in another new direction. I thought Inception was hugely original and insightful about the way people think. That level of abstraction and depth is present in this film. Bane bursts into it, his reputation is quickly established. Nolan uses people's expectations and anticipation to the fullest. We are left to wonder about what has happened in the 8 years since the events of The Dark Knight. Why have the characters become the way they are now?In the latter half, it does seem like the movie is trying to pull off so many different plot points and connections, but they all work. The cast is very large and impressive. You don't see ""good acting"". You see fascinating characters. They're just playing their part in the grand story that's being crafted. There are many unfamiliar faces but they all have a strange, unique look to them. We often see a person's flaws and previous decisions coming back to haunt them. They find out the hard way what mistakes they have made. Where their limits are. Where they lose control.The score is almost tribal, very raw and energetic. You don't get much chance to pay attention to it but many parts of the movie are pounding with excitement. There are countless quotable lines and disturbing slices of dialogue. They cut deep. The Joker was a great character and this is a very different movie but the themes are just as dark, only perhaps indirectly. Underneath, it's very sinister. Writing and efficiency appear to be among Nolan's greatest strengths. The story has many layers that interweave and apparently they came in under budget.Perhaps the most important thing about Catwoman is that she's completely believable. When she beats up men, you don't roll your eyes. She's feminine and powerful in her own way. She fits into the world and we completely understand her motivations. She doesn't have a huge role but a very important one.I didn't find myself moved but maybe I'm too cynical. I was more affected psychologically. Curious about humanity and all the different sides of it you see in this movie. It goes to many extremes. I felt humbled by my complete lack of life experience. What do I know about anything? How could I possibly understand half of the characters? I haven't been through anything or achieved anything compared to most of them. Michael Caine gets a bigger role this time. He was always critical but this time he's very much the emotional core.I thought Christian Bale was overlooked in The Dark Knight especially. The movies hinge on him. Bruce Wayne's just a man but also incredibly inspirational. Bale's famous for completely committing to his roles and it pays off. Tom Hardy is impressive as Bane but I suppose that's no surprise. The rest of the leads are similarly awesome. There are many references to the earlier films. Very few questions are left unanswered. It's always nice when film-makers really think it through and make an actual decision and get all the details right.So anyway, I'll miss Batman (since the trilogy has ended) but couldn't have hoped for a better, more epic and sincere finale to his story."
10,"This movie shows that despite failure, despite your fears, despite your enemies, you can be a hero. you can use all three of those things to your advantage and become something better than you were before you encountered them. it masterfully shows and tells that ANYONE can be a hero.obviously on a technical level this film is perfect. almost the entirety of the third act is shot in beautiful imax, that's sadly only in 16:9 on 4K. just like with the previous transfers, sound and picture are great, but this is probably the best looking film to me.it may not seem like it at first, but just like ra's and joker, bane is the opposite side of the same coin for batman. tom hardy perfectly embodies bane and the darkness, and obviously he's a downgrade from joker, but that doesn't mean he's not the perfect villain for a finale.hans zimmer delivers probably my third favorite score from him, with an incredible theme for bane as well as many extensions of previous themes.this is such an underrated finale. all three films mesh together so well, they feel like one. they mean so much to me, and i'll forever thank nolan for making these films."
11,"The Dark Knight Rises is the third and final installment in director Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. The story takes places eight years after the events of the last film, eight years since Batman vanished into the night and assumed responsibility for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent in the hopes that it would benefit the greater good. But when a new villain threatens to destroy Gotham City and cannot be stopped by law enforcement alone, Bruce Wayne is forced to adorn the black armor once again. The film introduces several new characters: John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young police officer whose loyalty lies in doing what is right and not blindly following his superiors. Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), a cat burglar working for Bane in hopes of obtaining a device that will erase a person's criminal history and giving her the chance to start a new life. Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), who encourages Bruce Wayne to rejoin the rest of the world and continue his father's philanthropic work. Loyal butler, Alfred (Sir Michael Caine), Commissioner of the Gotham Police, James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and genius inventor, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), also make a return to help Bruce Wayne become the Dark Knight once more. A new villain also enters the fray that is just as intelligent, resourceful and a better combatant than Batman (even breaking Batman's back at one point, depicting a classic scene from the comic series) – Bane (Tom Hardy), a terrorist portraying himself as a liberator of the people.Production staff really outdid themselves in making this film superb in every detail. In regards to the dramatic aspect, filming took place in several different cities across the world including New York, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, London and Jodhpur. By amalgamating different cities, staff members helped to make his imagination of Gotham resemble the description of the city given in the comics. Costume specialists helped to give Bain the appearance of a lucha libre (masked wrestler), which coupled with his resourcefulness and intelligence helped to create the perfect villain. The Dark Knight Rises takes place in an apocalyptic time with nuclear warfare threatening to destroy Gotham City. Cinematography experts helped to reinforce this doomsday ambiance by having Bane and his henchmen blow up all the bridges that lead out to the city, trapping the entire police force underground and unleashing the hooligans from the city jail in a scene that resembles the ""Storming of the Bastille"". The federal government also abandons Gotham, leaving the people of Gotham to fight the battle on their own. Even scenes that do not take place in the city show the helplessness of the times. When Bruce Wayne is imprisoned in foreign jail, Bane decides to ""torture his soul"" by having him watch the events unfold in Gotham on a television set while he is trapped in a virtually inescapable prison. Director Christopher Nolan stated that this film would mark the end of his interpretation of the Batman trilogy. However, the end of the film leaves the viewer with a final surprise: John Blake's legal is revealed to be Robin John Blake, a reference to Batman's comic book sidekick, and inherits the Batcave after Batman's ""demise"". This leaves the possibility open to an additional installment in the Batman franchise, and with the critical and financial success of the series, it may be a smart move for Warner Brother's to make (copyright owner's to the series).The film also leaves the viewers with a final message: a hero can be anyone. Whether it is placing a reassuring grasp on the shoulders friend, letting him know that things will get better, or helping a stranger on the side of the road who is having car troubles. Nolan's final episode is an earnest attempt to give a deserving end to a much-loved series. With cool gadgets, fast-paced chase and fight scenes, complex characters, and a story line that will keep you on the edge of your seat, fans of the Batman series will not be disappointed."
12,"There's a common misconception when it comes to The Dark Knight Rises especially regarding how it tackles it's themes and story: this film isn't trying to raise the stakes, it's trying to add to the story, in this case his loneliness, his sense of powerlessness.Hans Zimmer's score is some of the best I've ever heard, Wally Pfister peaked, had the best choreographed action scenes out of the whole trilogy, had the most emotionally resonant story out of the trilogy for sure. A very well made and satisfying conclusion that makes this trilogy one of the best .. ever?A perfect comic book movie, certainly one of my favourites of all time"
13,"The Batman series by Christopher Nolan was and is probably one of the best superhero series ever. In an industry where very few sequels have been that good, The Dark Knight, I believe was designed by Christopher Nolan to be head and shoulders above Batman Begins; and it was. The Dark Knight surpassed Batman Begins, end of story. Now that you have accomplished what very few have managed, how do you surpass this one. A daunting and mountainous task indeed. Only now, Nolan wasn't even trying to surpass it. He was merely trying to present a movie that would build on its predecessor.The movie is set 8 years after the Joker incident so that anything related to the Joker need not be shown (RIP Heath Ledger). Nolan presents us a completely different Gotham. A different take on it. And how 8 years can change people. How the harvey dent and joker incident can affect people and batman himself. In a time of peace, it is quite easy to plan and attack even an entire city. Everything is taken into concern. And it all adds up to one seemingly invincible villain. The logic is never lost at any point of time. The screenplay is penned to allow the impact of what has happened to Gotham and its people in ""The Dark Knight"" and what could happen if something goes wrong now.All things said, if you are expecting something better than The Dark Knight, you are mistaken. This was never going to compete or surpass that. This is a very good movie in its own right. As for the series, there cannot be a better conclusion and I really hope nobody else continues this series if Nolan decides not to.TDKR needs to be appreciated for staying true to its roots and still giving us something good, exhilarating and unexpected."
14,"I have to say it was a shock to watch Batman in IMAX Hall. On the one hand, this kind of shock comes from the almost perfect audio-visual experience of the IMAX hall, and more importantly, Nolan's precise control of the plot and the picture, cleverly combines the commercial film and the art film, and the commercial atmosphere is too rich. Less than one point, the artistic display is not in place. Exquisite acting, wonderful battle footage, excellent CG synthesis, perfect picture control, presents a near-perfect audio-visual feast.More than 2 hours, it is really wonderful. Now those one-and-a-half-hour movies are too short. The plot limits the whole story to reversal, feelings, passion, you can be selfish, but please do not to blame others. Grateful tribute to those who give in silence"
15,"There are plenty of elements that made this film work, so I suppose we can tick them off one by one. For starters, the continuation on the focus of Bruce Wayne's story, which has made it all tick. This version of Bruce Wayne and Alfred become the familiar characters we're accustomed with since 2005, and the film invests heavily on the emotional bonding between the two, which deals back to the theme about fear that rears its ugly head again, and how a father figure cannot stand idly by to watch the one he brought up recklessly charge into battle after a long hiatus, and hoping for a life of normalcy with the mantle of the bat given up. Michael Caine may have a shorter screen time than before, but no less powerful.When Sam Raimi had to put the popular and powerful Venom into Spider-man 3 pretty much against his wishes, we all knew how that turned out to be, effectively killing off the franchise until the decision to reboot it. There may be some similar fears with the introduction of a fairly contemporary villain in Bane, but the story gave him more purpose and meaning, and Tom Hardy was excellent par none in this role as the compete villain - with plenty of brawn, merciless, masterful, and with a plan any terrorist would be proud of. If the Scarecrow meant to induce fear, and the Joker to create chaos, Bane is carnage incarnate. Tom Hardy, even being the requisite mask, is fearful, and while the designs of his plan may dwarf the Joker's in complexity, it sure rivaled his in terms of delivery, and execution. Anyone in his path gets shoved aside with deadly consequences, and anyone alive is only because there is of further use. No hesitation, and no compromise.And Nolan continues with the introduction of a lot more villains big and small, behind a mask or otherwise, in his Bat films than anyone would credit him for, especially when having those whose lines are blurred, or corrupt to the core and hiding behind social status and fortune. This in turn provides for another arc that boils underneath the main narrative, where the rich and powerful continue to enjoy their successes at the expense of the have-nots, and the Occupy Movement in a way being a very real parallel to the proceedings on screen. While the mobsters were clearly at the top of the food chain in the earlier Nolan films, this one shifted focus to politicians and the elite community, with their fair share of scandals and corporate greed.While Bane was to the point, Selina Kyle played by Anne Hathaway, is both sensual and a force to be reckoned with herself, being like how she's best portrayed, on the fence. There's a bit of Frank Miller's Year One in this one given the presence of Juno Temple's Holly, and the back to basics as a jewel thief, compared to the mousy secretary in Tim Burton's Batman Returns with Michelle Pfeiffer defining the role, and the garbage that was Halle Berry's. Anne Hathaway nailed this one with what would be a truly memorable outing, and as if a homage of sorts to Burton's second Batman film, that the repartee between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle at a party became one of the highlights here, as does her thievery and combat ability. She may lack her whip, but more than makes up for it with her steel stiletto heels, and the very sensual and sleekly designed feline moves that you'd wonder how they got delivered while wrapped under that skin tight suit.And not only is the technology put on screen fictionally impressive, the technical aspects behind the scenes also worked wonders, chalking up serious mileage in having more than an hour's worth of footage shot on the IMAX format. Wally Pfister's cinematography continues to impress with that staying consistent to the gritty look and feel developed for all the Bat films to date, before his departure into a film director's role for his next project. Hans Zimmer also probably developed the best score for Nolan's Bat films, and I dare say without which this film would be less stellar, with the score playing a huge role in adding plenty of character and emotion to the film, lifting it up with excitement during the many set action pieces, with recognizable themes assigned to major players, heightening dangers, and providing a boost to the many feelings in this one heck of an action-adventure. With how things developed at the end, and what I felt was initial horror of sorts with Batman out in broad daylight, secret identity being porous and all, this film ended in what would be the best way possible - with possibilities, and a twinkle of an eye, Inception style with a did it, or did it not. Twists, turns, surprises and sleight of hand, making it a clear favourite as one of the best this year. Do yourself a favour and watch it in the IMAX format, just as it was intended.Because you have just got to believe in Christopher Nolan, and the kind of films he has so far delivered. Take a bow, bat-crew, for a trilogy that has now set the bar for any comic book film, and especially any other follow Batman movie, reboot or otherwise, to live up to."
16,"I cannot imagine a ""Batman"" movie after ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (**** out of ****) without ""Inception"" director Christopher Nolan at the helm. Warner Brothers and DC Comics got this legendary costume-clad crime fighter trilogy 'right.' Sure, you can nitpick, but Nolan's ""Batman"" movies differed in ambiance from those of both Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher. Nolan's ""Batman"" movies trod a thin line turning a vigilante into a hero and scrutinizing the morality of his behavior. Essentially, Nolan rebooted the franchise, recreated Bruce Wayne and Batman as troubled alter-egos, and turned the good versus evil episodes of the earlier films into full-blown spectacles. While sticking slavishly to the basics, he relied on his fertile imagination to give the characters greater depth and examine the issue of vigilantism. Nolan's Caped Crusader movies don't rely on humor as much as slight, off-hand comments. The action unfolds swiftly, and the characters are clearly delineated before the end credits roll. You prepare yourself for the surprises. The films replicate the haunted quality that Burton forged with his Michael Keaton forays, while Schumacher embraced a bright, heavily saturated, slightly surreal comic book quality. Of course, the ""Batman"" graphic novels of Frank Miller have influenced Nolan. Christian Bale's part in the success of the trilogy is considerable. He is more of a Michael Keaton ""Batman"" than either a Val Kilmer or a George Clooney crime fighter. Bale is to Batman the same way that Sean Connery was to Bond. Long-time British actor Michael Caine makes a superb Alfred Pennyworth, but Michael Gough was no slouch himself in the four previous ""Batman"" incarnations. Unquestionably, Nolan steps back from Batman at the Caped Crime Buster's zenith. The ending to this trilogy capper is odd. Indeed, Warner Brothers conceivably could make another ""Batman"" movie based on Nolan's conclusion to ""The Dark Knight Rises.""Anybody who tries to top ""The Dark Knight Rises"" will have a lot to prove both artistically and financially. Christopher Nolan is to the ""Batman"" movies what James Cameron was to the ""Terminator"" movies. Stepping into Nolan's shoes will pose a supreme challenge for whoever dares. Nolan approached the ""Batman"" franchise with reverence, played the plots as close to straight as possible, and shunned clever one-liners. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" surpasses both the ""Batman Begins"" origin movie and ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Dark Knight Rises"" takes the franchise to the brink of annihilation with what amounts to a Gotham City Armageddon. Batman contends with two worthy opponents that played a part in his origins. The most obvious villain is Bane. A hulking brute of a man, he looks like a cross between of a wrestler and equivalent of a human pit bulldog. Bane wears a contraption over his face that enables him to handle the pain of life. Basically, we never see British actor Tom Hardy's face because he conceals it with a mask. Interestingly, this imbues Bane with a mystery. Furthermore, Bane speaks through this contraption and he sounds quite avuncular. In other words, he doesn't sound as menacing as Darth Vader, but he doesn't mince words. Finally, former Disney princess Anne Hathaway makes a willowy Cat Woman. Just as the Marvel people had trouble getting Hulk right, the DC people have experienced similar trouble getting Catwoman right. Anne Hathaway makes the perfect Catwoman.The sheer spectacle of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" dwarfs ""The Dark Knight."" Eight years has elapsed since the murder of Harvey Dent and the disappearance of the Caped Crusader. Guests at Wayne Manor make remarks about the tragic figure skulking about on the balcony in the distance. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale of ""Terminator Salvation"") has turned into a contemporary Howard Hughes. He is amazed when he catches a burglar in his side of the mansion. Moreover, she is a delectable burglar. She has cracked Wayne's safe and stolen his mother's pearls. Since Gotham City is largely safe now, the authorities are not prepared when a gang assaults Wall Street and tries to plunge the economy in chaos. Batman makes a triumphant return in top form with a new gadget that resembles a mini-helicopter. Initially, Batman has no trouble licking his adversaries. Against the Catwoman, he seems vulnerable. She likes to let him down. When he confronts Bane, Batman's gauntleted fists exert no more effect on him than they would on a bag of cement. Indeed, Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman of ""The Fifth Element"") is back on the case. He knows the truth about Harvey Dent, even if he doesn't know the identity of the Batman. If you missed either or both ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" you may find yourself in an expositional purgatory. Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy fits snugly together, aside from the change of casting between ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" when Maggie Gyllenhaal replaced Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes in the District Attorney's Office. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" packs the Caped Crusader into exile. Bane batters him into submission. Nolan takes not only Gotham City to the limit, but also he takes audiences to the limit with an actioneer that clocks in at 164 minutes. Nevertheless, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" qualifies as the best ""Batman"" movie ever!"
17,"I've always loved superhero movies and as a kid Batman was my favourite superhero and I collected as many of the comic books as I could possibly afford.Saying that I've never expected a superhero movie to be between the best genres of movies that I would ever watch. I just expect them to be entertaining and something fun to watch. I watch most of them; Superman, Spiderman, Ironman, X-men etc.I expected the same this time but I was knocked off my feet. The actors, the storyline, the manuscript and the filming just came together as one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie has really brilliant and powerful dialogues.If you haven't seen it yet then I can strongly recommend it. I will definitely see it again with a good bottle of wine and popcorn. Enjoy!"
18,"Chris Nolan has r-e-a-l-l-y outdone himself again this time. An amazing story that I don't even know who else could write such a treatment on the World's Greatest Detective, the crowning glory of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.I remember I once made a joke to myself a long while ago about him that if he was going to make another movie, he would probably cast Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's respective love interests from a movie of which they BOTH starred in and worked on-- 10 Things I Hate About You.It would be ironically funny how both actors are connected to each other from working at different times with the ""holy-moly mind-blowing"" filmmaker and that the actresses that played their love interests would possibly too as well."
19,"Christopher Nolan reinvents Batman in a powerful and much darker way. Batman Begins is a gripping and compelling origin of the hero. The Dark Knight is a lot more serious, realistic, and powerful Batman movie. The Dark Knight Rises is the last of the series. It is ought to be larger and better. It does succeed to be the biggest of the rest of the series. Although, it's not as as superior as The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight Rises is still a fantastic and grand cinematic experience.Every sequel gets bigger and bigger. The threats are getting worse and worse. The Dark Knight Rises is more than just big stuff. There is always suspense that keeps the movie exciting. The best thing about the action is it's not about being pretentiously cool, but it is made to give you anxiety to the fights of Batman between the enemy. Tom Hardy nailed it as Bane. He brings a lot of fear and menace to it. It's different to The Joker but Bane is an intriguing villain.Most of the movie is the anarchy in Gotham and Bruce Wayne's suffering. There isn't much action fighting in those scenes. What matters here is how you can feel the danger of the characters. The chaotic turn of Gotham really looks bleak and gloomy that makes you think everybody is doomed. Compelling and heartbreaking emotions is always there.Much credit goes to Christopher Nolan. Despite of its almost three hour runtime, the film is well fast paced and completely entertaining. His action scenes are totally different to the action scenes of movies these days. He's focused to the thrills than looking cool. Some fistfights can be a little underwhelming, but he's best at the chase scenes. The CGI is obviously good and not excessive.The Dark Knight Rises is a lot more daring than anyone would expect. It's one of those superhero movies that cares more to heroism than just action. The scale is large and it is so explosive. That is the usual formula of all blockbusters, but here, it uses it in a darker and suspenseful way. The Dark Knight Rises is just beyond your expectations. It's also a fitting end of this amazing trilogy. I still think The Dark Knight is the best of the three. That movie is something you can't compare to any other film. Even this and Batman Begins. But hey, The Dark Knight Rises is such an excellent grand experience."
20,"From Christopher Nolan, Director of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', comes 'The Dark Knight Rises' or 'The Best Film I've Ever Seen'.PROS: To start off, the performances of all the actors, from leading man Christian Bale to God himself, Morgan Freeman are all excellent. They make the characters likable and enjoyable to watch on screen. Yes, Bale's Batman voice can get irritating but, let's face it, 'The Amazing Spider- Man' was irritating, too. Just like 'Skyfall', the villain steals the show. Tom Hardy as Bane is one of the years greatest villain performances, it actually surpasses Heath Ledger's Joker, he was good, yes, but the way he was written, we didn't get any depth to the character, he was just a crazy little lunatic who blew up buildings, where Bane acts as a tenacious dictator and actually has a goal. His voice is dominant, load and extremely scary, with a strange mix of a British/Caribbean accent. The grand scale of the film is absolutely huge, and it works perfectly with the IMAX frame and the loud, booming orchestral music by Hans Zimmer. It's just a beautifully crafted film.'SPOILER ALERT!'CONS: My ONE AND ONLY gripe for this film is that Bane's death was very anti- climactic, because I feel that Batman should have killed him. But it doesn't take away the fact that this is a perfect film.So, not only is this the best film of 2012 to me, but the best film I've ever seen. BY FAR.Directed by: Christopher NolanWritten by: Jonathan Nolan & Christopher NolanStarring: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon- Levitt & Morgan Freeman"
21,"The Dark Knight Rises definitely was one of the most anticipated movies ever. Its predecessor The Dark Knight raised the stakes so high that expectations surrounding this film was gigantic. Definitely it was a perfect end to the trilogy ( given that Nolan said it would be the last of his Batman films) but Rises was not even remotely close when compared to the Dark Knight. The Major flaws of the films include the incomprehensible motives of Bane. The Nuclear Bomb with a six mile radius. The hurried and unintelligible relationship between Bruce and Miranda Tate and finally the unnecessary length of the film. Bruce Wayne is without his wealth and I really missed the Rich Playboy in action. However That might be because of enforcing the Dark tone of the series furthermore. But really Bruce Wayne without his wealthy attitude is kind of a miss one has to admit. The film Hurries in some of the parts which it required to elaborate and elaborates some of the parts that were really not necessary. Bane as a super Villain wasn't really great. He talks too much when compared to his imposing physical built. Scarecrow's unnecessary appearance as a judge of the court literally made no sense.On the Positive side the Acting has been really top notch. Anne Hathaway is definitely the catch of this film. She really did a brilliant Job, and her chemistry with Batman was also fascinating. Joseph Gordon-Levitt also pulled out a very convincing performance. Goes without saying Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman played their part with astonishing brilliance as it is expected to be. And finally Special mention must be made of Christian Bale, he really proved it one more time that he is worth of every critical acclaim he has achieved so far. Every single agony, every single contradiction and every single suffering of the torn apart Bruce was portrayed with perfection. For me It is really hard to visualize someone else playing Batman other than Chris Bale. The Action sequences of the film were pretty good, the chase, the Flying bat and the stunts were really pleasing to the eye. The Ending was also top notch according to me and its at this very point the film hits the highest note. The redemption of Bruce is something that is indeed a daring step and was executed to perfection. Here credit must be given to Christopher Nolan to take the story to a point where Bruce Wayne no longer needed The Batman. Levitt finding the Bat cave and taking up the mantle of justice and Bruce with Selina in Florence fulfilling Alfred Pennyworth's life long dream had to be the Best scenes of the film and was indeed worth every penny. The film established what it sought to, Batman is not an individual, anybody can be the Batman, its a symbol and does not matter who is wearing the mask and the cape. But the Film takes too long to establish what it wants to with quite a few plot holes and becomes incomprehensible at times. In the End it has to be admitted that Christopher Nolan is capable of much more and I believe this film could have been made much better. The Dark Knight Rises though a fitting end to the trilogy is not even remotely close to the Dark Knight. That is where the disappointment creeps in a bit more. The Dark Knight Perhaps is the best superhero movie ever made and it will be wrong to compare it with ""Rises"" but then again this comparison was bound to come. If one has no memory of the Dark Knight, 'Rises' is definitely a worthy watch. It is really interesting to see what Christopher Nolan does from here. 'Rises' in my opinion marks the end of an era in this great filmmaker's career and his fans will definitely keep an watch on what turn does it take from here onwards."
22,"I have to give this movie a 10. I just have to. I thought The Dark Knight was good but this movie just blows Dark Knight out of the water without even flinching. Yeah, it's that good.SPOILER ALERT! To start off with I knew very little about what was happening other than what the movies tell you coming into this movie. I never read any of the comics or any of that stuff. So the fact that i understood it as well as i did and felt like i completely understood what was going on is tribute and credit to Christopher Nolan's OUTSTANDING directing capabilities.I was surprised by some things at first but some of them made sense after a couple of views. One thing still doesn't make sense to me though; what in the heck was Bruce thinking? He hasn't had a good workout for 8 years and he tries to go take on someone who's both stronger than him and his martial arts equal? What the heck? That still baffles me. However i'll never forget how i felt the first i saw Bane just pick Batman apart without even flinching and breaks his back right at the end. I was even told beforehand that Batman gets his trash kicked but nothing could have prepared me for that absolute beating. Not to mention that kick that Bane delivers when Batman is on the stairs has to be one of the most savage and devastating kicks i've ever seen in my life. It's almost like i can hear some of Batman's ribs just shatter even inside his body armor when Bane kicks him like that! I still cringe even after watching the fight scene literally dozens of times.The whole movie is just incredible. That's the one word to sum it all up. Incredible. The slow start and the great buildup towards the climax of the movie. Then, when Gary Oldman asks Batman what they're going to do and Batman just responds with one word: ""War"" i got chills. I got so excited when i saw how everything was going to play out! It was nice in a way to see Batman get his revenge on Bane but that was also a kind of cheap way because he used his elbow blades to slash Bane's mask which made him significant weaker to the point where Batman could beat him. But even then after Batman tries to return the savage kick Bane gave to him while Bane is helplessly lying there on the ground just doesn't compare. Sorry Bruce, Bane's the more savage kicker. The breathtaking betrayal at the end i never saw coming.This is one incredible movie! Outstanding performances by everyone especially by Christian Bale as Batman and Tom Hardy as Bane. Bane goes down as one of my all time favorite villains after that amazing performance by Tom Hardy.Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this movie!"
23,"I am not going to lie. I was fearful for this movie. Normally when you think of trilogy's the third one is always the weakest one-Godfather part 3, Spiderman 3, Matrix Revolutions. However, this movie is-in my opinion-the strongest of the Nolan Batman Trilogy. Nolan proved to all of the critics that he was right with going of the character of Bane, a terrorist who has great plans to fulfil his destiny in the city of Gotham. Tom Hardy excels in this role and it is one of his best roles in any movie he's done. He is required to do a lot of acting with his eyes and he has great screen presence, it immediately makes you feel intimidated. Anne Hathaway added depth to the Catwoman character, and portrayed her excellently. Yet, the icing on the cake is Christian Bale who reprises his role of Batman. The whole atmosphere in Gotham is created through Nolan's direction of the film. It's a very dark setting, darker than The Dark Knight was, but this adds further to the main theme of the story-redemption. It was the best movie in 2012 and Nolan, I thank you for a superb trilogy!"
24,"I can't express in words of how amazing this movie is. All I have to say is go watch it for yourself.the is really the best,don't get me wrong i enjoyed the others but this one truly takes the cake!I said before batman begins is the best film i had ever seen without any exception. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source.a big kiss for Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway i really love them.if i visit USA this will be for visit Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway. thanks for all."
25,"After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in ""BATMAN & ROBIN"". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.**** (out of four)"
26,"The Dark Knight Rises was a perfect sequel to a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan took a different direction and focused more on Bruce Wayne/Batman. This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master."
27,Bane is a more terrifying nemesis than the Joker. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was booming. An unforgettable end to the trilogy
28,"Possibly my personal favourite of the Nolan Batman films, and I do like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much. Is it perfect? For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
29,"Even though it's kind of flawed, this is still a fantastic conclusion to the dark Knight trilogy for starters bane is a very good villain and makes a great threat to Batman, this feels more like a superhero movie then the dark Knight, the dark Knight, was most part a crime movie featuring Batman and the joker but Batman begins and this movie, feels more like superhero movies, and it succeeds at that the only criticism that I can give this movie is cat woman even though Anne Hathaway gives a very good performance feel like she is still a little off, and Tim was not very good in my opinion, but everything else is a very good conclusive chapter to this trilogy."
30,"The Dark Knight Rises (2012) Film Review Cast: Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Gary Oldman, Marion Cotillard, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson. Director: Christopher Nolan Synopsis: Christian Bale stars as the classic superhero Batman and his billionaire alter-ego, Bruce Wayne. In the last installment of Christopher Nolan's Batman films, Bruce Wayne no longer feels that the City of Gotham needs a hero and goes into hiding. However, when a new villain, Bane, played by Tom Hardy, threatens Gotham City, Wayne decides to pick up his mask again and come to the rescue of the city. Review: Christopher Nolan introduces the final, thrilling chapter in his Batman series, and it certainly is another big adrenaline-filled, comic- inspired movie, which feels right on the big screen. As all sorts of familiar faces keep us grounded and the audience is introduced to a few new characters as well. When crisis threatens Gotham City, Bruce Wayne jumps back into the Batmobile to fight crime. Batman is joined on his quest by a young and eager cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an elusive cat burglar (Anne Hathaway), and the ultimate violent masked villain (Tom Hardy). This film served as great entertainment with its colorful cast and unexpected plot twists. Nolan also used some actors that had either appeared in previous Batman films or in his other major hit, Inception. All of them were shown in their respective roles: a massive Tom Hardy was almost unrecognizable in his Bane costume, while Joseph Gordon- Levitt and Marion Cotillard were both great as Robin and Talia—and obviously comfortable with the directing style and the overall dramatic tone, similar to that of Inception. The only actor that seemed out of place was Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle. Typically, Anne Hathaway has been cast as a sort of girl next door, so it came as a shock to watch her steal and fight her way through the City of Gotham. After a few scenes, however, it becomes evident that the casting decision was a good one, as Hathaway portrayed a darker Catwoman role very well. This is a long film, in traditional Nolan's style, clocking in at over 160 minutes. There were a few times when the movie felt drawn out, but the dramatic action scenes and impressive dialogue really held the audience's attention and kept them on the edge of their seats. However, the timeline tended to be a bit confusing at times. Sometimes, throughout the movie, it was hard to tell how long it had been since the last time a given character had been on screen. Left with no knowledge of passing time (days, months, years even) was really the only shortcoming in this film. Despite the minor flaws in this film, The Dark Knight Rises is exciting, creative, and dark—and certainly well worth a few hours of your time."
31,"An epic end to an epic series. This movie had everything, action, emotion ,every single thing. If Batman would have died, then it would have been a very sad ending.Everybody was so delighted, literally cheering when they saw him alive. The acting of everyone, was just outstanding. This is the best cast there ever could be. Joker was a great villain. But so is Bane. Some would say Joker is better, in my opinion its a tie. Batman is the best superhero there ever could be. This trilogy just seams so real and possible even though its just fiction. Thanks Christopher Nolan for 3 outstanding movies. There were no flaws in the movie. To produce such a great film after The Dark Knight, its just marvelous."
32,"-Minor Spoilers- First of all, why hate so much? The movie is not perfect, agreed. It's not the best movie ever, again agreed. However it's one of the best movies, and it's pretty damn good, even if it's not perfect. The plot is good, the action is good, cast is great, acting is great too, and the atmosphere the movie creates is fantastic! Ignore all the hate, and please go enjoy the film. And I don't understand, why are people comparing this movie to TDK? They're by the same director and they're part of the same trilogy, no comparison. TDK is too perfect, and we all know that. So why did ya all have your expectations sky high. Whenever a director releases a movie which is near-perfect, then it is hard for him/her to beat that movie. Sure he/she can make a movie equal to the other one, but to beat it, think again. Thus my expectations for TDKR were high, but not sky high. And guess what? It crossed my expectations, and it was really close to TDK. Tremendous film!Lately I haven't developed an interest in comic book reading, and I really don't enjoy batman or to be honest I don't enjoy much of superhero films at all. Only a few. However I didn't only enjoy this movie as a superhero film, I also enjoyed it itself as a movie. The reason I don't watch many superhero films is because they're very tedious and repetitive, and there's no message. Here is how your everyday superhero film goes ""There is ""Whatever"" man. Some stupid person attempts to outsmart the _____man, and take over the city, and guess what? He fails, and ______ man gets respect for saving the city...the end"". TDKR was out of the ordinary. To be honest, the whole trilogy was ""Out of the box"" thinking, especially this and TDK. Both this and TDK made it to my Top 10 films of all-time, and many movies at this time don't even make it close.The movie did have its problems as well, it was not perfect. One of the major concerns was the time. The movie had a near-3hr run time which was more than enough. There were some slow and boring parts at the beginning and middle of the film, but as the movie approached the ending, none of this really mattered. Also I didn't really like how Bane died. He was really bad-ass up until the end, where Catwoman whipped him out in 1 second. I was expecting another fight between Batman and Bane, only to find out something else? It was too fast of a death, and not only that, he was the villain of the film, how can you kill a villain in 1 second? And it was not even Batman who killed him, it was Catwoman? I personally wasn't expecting this at all.-Major Spoilers- The movie really kept you glued to the screen near the end. I really liked the plot twists and never expected some of them. Though some were predictable, but others weren't, IMO. For example, Batman surviving, and Talia escaping from the prison rather than Bane was pretty unpredictable. On the other hand, John Black turning out to be Robin, and Miranda Tate turning out to be Talia al Ghul was more predictable. I think there were some more plot twists, but I can't really remember, because I saw the full movie once, and that was 3 months back.At first I thought Bane was the one who escaped from the prison, and was the son of Henri Ducard, but it turned out that it was Talia, and Bane was just a friend. This was the real shocker for me. I didn't really care much for the other plot twists, but this really shook me hard. I never expected this, in fact I even forgot about this up until the end. Also batman surviving? This was the second most unpredictable twist. At first I thought just maybe he survived, but after the funeral, I was sure that he was dead. Then he appears in Florence? This was pretty shocking as well.The second half of the film was the best, because that's when the excitement began. I was very curious about what was going to happen next. After the explosion scenes, the suspense began to rise rapidly. Then the climax came all together very nicely.My favourite parts of the film in the first half were the opening ""Plane Hijack"" scene, the ""Stock Exchange"" scene, and ""Bane vs Batman"" fight 1. In the second half my favourite scenes were the ""Football explosion"" scene, ""Bane vs Batman"" fight 2, and the final chase scene. Some of the other fight scenes involving Catwoman and Robin were pretty good too.Final thoughts, I didn't expect much of this movie after TDK. TDK was perfect, and I thought this movie would be no where close, but it was pretty damn close. It was really good too. The action was great. The cast, acting, and dialogue were all fantastic. Especially the dialogue between Alfred and Bruce. Gary Oldman did a great job, not to mention that Joseph Gordon-Levitt did an amazing job as well. Tom Hardy turned out to be a great villain. Even though Bane's voice was kind of confusing, but it was pretty cool. Overall the whole movie includes some great action scenes, and runs a full circle completing TDK legend in an Epic way! Final Rating 9/10."
33,"Christopher Nolan's stunning conclusion to his Batman trilogy is a welcome return to form after the slightly overrated THE DARK KNIGHT, which was so obsessed with being all dark and brooding that it forgot to tell much of a story. Despite the presence of a much-hyped (and lamented) Heath Ledger in the cast, I found that film to be less entertaining than BATMAN BEGINS although it still remains an engaging and watchable film. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (horrible title, by the way), though, blows it out of the water, offering a piece of sheer spectacle that's as involving and as tightly-plotted as you could wish for.It's eight years since the last film, and Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nowadays retired and definitely feeling his age. Before long, though, a hulking brute of a bad guy (Tom Hardy, whose sheer physicality in the role will surprise nobody who's seen Bronson) decides to do some very unpleasant things in the city, so it's time to dust off the bat suit and get back into the action. Good news for the viewer.As usual, Nolan surpasses the conventions of his genre, making this a superhero film that looks nothing like a superhero film, instead more like a modern-day epic of dramatic cinema. Yes, at the end of the day it's still about suited guys beating the hell out of each other, and Nolan once again relies on old conventions/clichés (such as the 'ticking bomb' trope, which he's repeated in his last three films now) to see him through, but everyone runs so well and so smoothly that you end up not minding.The cast is thorough and involved as ever, Bale as usual going the extra mile to portray the tortured hero and Caine lending emotional support as Alfred. Hardy's villain is a sheer powerhouse who dominates every scene he's in, and Nolan brings back a couple of his favourites from INCEPTION (Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) for good measure. There's not quite as much action as you might expect from a film of this type, but the storyline is so involved that you don't care. Throw plenty of stunning special effects into the mix and you have a real crowd-pleaser of a film with real brain as well as brawn."
34,"WOW, JUST WOW! Nolan has created posible one of the best trilogys of all time.Look if im being honest this was the batman movie I was less excited to watch, it could never top the dark knigth, and the addition of catwomen just seem like a lacy addition to add something new. But oh was I thankfully wrong.This movie explored new caracters such as bane and catwomen and they were perfectly introduce.One of the things I most liked was how it was connected to the series roots, it had many connections with the first movie which was something I liked.I also really like how depressing it is for batman, this movie takes the suffering more emotionaly which really made me feel bad for batman.The villan was extrenly decent, it wasent the joker yet it was still good. The performances were nice.9.5 out of 10 truly one of the best superheroe movie."
35,"Nolan continues with the last chapter of the trilogy dedicated to the Dark Knight and closes the circle of the story. As always, he appears to be an introverted character full of internal conflicts who will find himself having to clash with everything and everyone to deal with the new threat, ""Bane"". As always, the plot is full of interesting ideas and is confirmed to be of the highest level although perhaps not reaching the peaks of the two previous stories, and hence my 9. It certainly brings to completion a saga that will remain immortal and will probably no longer be affected by any another suitor. For all those who love the genre, absolutely unmissable and ""obligatory"" for those who have viewed the two previous chapters."
36,"A feline fingerer has taken to your pearls, although identity's the intent of this girl, as she initiates engagement, allows the stirring of assuagement, the final chapter is prepared, starts to unfurl. A villain name of Bane brings down an empire, an exchange leads to a tomb, so deep and dire, a saviour's weaponised, the population terrorised, Ra's al Ghul's destructive end, is the desire. But there are those who can align and form resistance, as you recover your resolve and your persistence, as the endgame twists and turns, a web of intrigue is discerned, and you race to save the day and create distance."

In this third installment of Christopher Nolan's Batman films, Bruce Wayne no longer feels that the City of Gotham needs a hero and goes on a secluded hiatus. However, when a new villain, Bane (Tom Hardy), threatens Gotham City, Wayne dons his cape and mask once more.Review: Christopher Nolan brings yet another adrenaline-filled, comic-inspired movie to the big screen. We see all sorts of familiar faces this time around, but the audience is introduced to a few new characters as well.When crisis threatens Gotham City, Bruce Wayne jumps back into the Batmobile to fight crime. Batman is joined on his quest by an eager orphaned cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a seductive cat burglar (Anne Hathaway), and a violent masked villain (Tom Hardy).This film served as great entertainment with its colorful cast and numerous plot twists.

She has historically been typecast as the girl next door, so it was a shock to watch her steal and fight her way through the City of Gotham. After a few scenes, however, we were convinced that the casting decisions was a good one, as Hathaway portrayed the darker Catwoman role brilliantly.True to Nolan's style, at 164 minutes, this film is fairly long. There were a few times when the movie felt a bit drawn out, but the gorgeous action scenes and impressive dialogue really held the audience's attention and kept them on the edge of their seats. However, the timeline was a bit unclear at times. For a number of scenes, it was hard to tell whether it had been days or months or years that had passed since the last time a given character had been on screen.Despite the films minor shortcomings, The Dark Knight Rises is exciting, creative, and dark—and well worth a few hours of your time."
38,"I'm sure at this point everything has been written about Nolan's 3rd installment to this trilogy. So, I am just going to add this, I had two major problems with this movie: (1) The dialog audio was periodically buried in the soundtrack. There were many times I had no idea what was being said. I have this on Bluray and had to back it up multiple times, and still some things were impossible for me to understand. Along with this was Bane's audio which was even more difficult for me to make out. I realize it fashionable to emphasize/hype-up the audio for the rock-concert effect. But there was so much bottom-end EQ-boost it made for much of his dialog unintelligible.*Spoiler-alert* (2) Four times in the last 30 minutes someone is on the brink of being killed ( or at least seriously hurt) only to be rescued. Its not always necessary to write in this kind of fractional desperation, and these actions became obvious and annoying to me. Other than these 2 items, I loved the movie and was a fitting end to Nolan's brilliant and masterful vision of this character."
39,"After the near perfect Batman Begins and The Dark Knight the third and final part of Nolans epic Batman trilogy was always going to be tricky. Traditionally part three of a trilogy is the weakest link, godfather 3,matrix revolutions, return of the jedi all arguably those respective series low points. What Nolan managed to do was provide a satisfying finale that not only wrapped up the themes and arcs that began in Begins it also managed to add more to his Dark Knight mythos. Drawing from popular story arcs such as Knightfall (where Bane breaks Batman both physically and mentally), No Mans Land (which saw Gotham cut of from the world, run by the cities most dangerous criminals while Batman and the police try to take back the city), of course The Dark Knight Returns (an older Bruce Wayne putting on the cape and cowl to battle a new, younger nemesis). Not only story arc points but overall themes covered in those and other stories, a major one the idea of anyone can be Batman as he is a symbol, a big theme of Grant Morrisons post Batman RIP arc known as Batman Reborn where Dick Grayson aka the first Robin became Batman after Bruce was believed to have died. Nolan managed to combine the various elements from these arcs and their themes to create a compelling, and enjoyable movie enhanced by not only great direction but fantastic performances. Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Joseph Godon Levitt, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Marion Cotillard were all great in their roles, Hathaway and Hardy especially as the conflicted thief Selina Kyle and menacing yet intelligent villain Bane respectively. The real stand out performance here though was Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Bales performance has been the strong back bone of this trilogy, highlighted in its third and final chapter. The action was great, the liberal use of CGI (another series trademark) was refreshing from the usual action/comic book fare. The movie was well told, well directed, well acted and served as a perfect final chapter to not only the best comic series made, but one of cinemas best trilogies."
40,"The plot is very good and unpredictable, the story is amazing just like The Dark Knight. Nolan did a great job doing this movie with a very huge expectations from the movie critics following the huge success from the earlier sequel, The Dark Knight in 2008. The Catwoman role was bigger than I thought it would be, she was an enemy but then became Batman's partner Tom Hardy's Bane look terrific and menacing with his control-freak personality and a bit of Joker's agent-of-chaos. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's role is also bigger than it looks like from the trailer, from a young cops to be the new Batman It's very satisfying how Nolan showed us that ""Batman Always Win"" and the fact that Bruce Wayne live made my day Overall a very great movie"
41,"I will unabashedly admit that when I chose my favourite Super-hero, I always tended more towards Iron-Man..but since Chris Nolan decided to start making his epic movies about Batman, my loyalties have faltered a bit. In all the three movies, the way he's made Batman swoop through the differing shades of grey, has made me fall more and more in love with the 'realness' of this character, so to speak. And gifting this role to Bale who embraced it such, he almost made it part of his persona, was a fantastic decision.So obviously, after Batman Begins, the sequel movies always had me expecting the moon, unrealistic but absolutely worth it! Out came The Dark Knight and introduced the world to the purest form of evil, we can experience. The Joker was written with a finesse hard to find in the movies today, and Ledger (silent pause) played it with such passion, I would believe that he could slit a man's mouth right open if he didn't smile. No gory imagery, just pure evil psyche..the Joker carried the movie on his back, while Oldman and Bale were the rocket engines that drove it to its success.Now with The Dark Knight Returns, it was a conclusion I had wished would never happen (too many sequels were ending, all with Harry Potter and all, my childhood was just zooming past!!) yet in the same breath, couldn't wait for it to come out in the theatres. I live in a middle- eastern country and TDKR had released on the exact date that Ramadan had started, so I waited another month till I could watch it...today on Eid! I was nervous, but I entered the theatre, equipped with my coke and a sizeable portion of popcorn. I had read the reviews, heard my friends talk about it..still the glimmer of hope, that this would be everything I hoped for...and more! I was RIGHT! I loved every bit of the movie, it's grandeur, emotions, raw energy, passion...it was right on...the best conclusion Nolan could've created to pacify my geeky-comic-book needs. A masterstroke to bring back Scarecrow and Ras Al Gul....it unfortunately left me wanting to see some part of the Joker (almost like a child!)... I'd suggest EVERYONE must watch this movie at least once in IMAX, it adds to its magnificence, and is the only tribute technology can pay to such a mastermind of a movie.All of us owe a big thank you to Nolan, Bale and Oldman for allowing us the honour of living at least 1 and a half hours of Gotham's life, three times! There are seldom any more super hero movies I looked forward to as much as I did to Batman/ Dark Knight. That you can relate to the sentiments expressed in these 3 movies, is something not many other superhero movies have achieved on this scale. Much respect for that."
42,"This movie is full of excitement, explosions, and edge of your seat moments. It ties up all of the loose ends in a great culmination to the series. The casting is perfect. I was surprised by some of the characters that were added. I would have liked to see the story line continued though. It is a bit of a let down that they didn't incorporate more of the villains.Or even continue the series to include cooperative adventures for multiple DC heroes.It is great that they managed to keep all of the same actors from the previous movies. It irritated me when they changed the actress who played Rachel. I think that this is a good date movie or movie for a family with older children. Of course it is great for a guys night. Make sure you have you popcorn ready."
43,"To begin, I was really nervous about this film. Ending a trilogy, bringing in a new villain with Bane, a major new character with Selina Kyle, and an original character/sidekick in John Blake all within three hours. That's a daunting task for any director, Nolan or otherwise. I won't touch on every character or scene, just the ones that stood out the most to me. The shots are wide and grand, some scenes playing out with little to no score - a move that gives complete focus to the screen. The opening with Bane's arrival had me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hardy played the character as few could, showing a strong physique and unquestionable mannerisms. Bane's voice (a source of debate) was unique and brought a different edge to the antagonist. I knew watching this character that he could - and would kill or main anyone in his path and also had the brain to create plans on a massive scale. Selina Kyle is a very welcome addition to the film. Anne Hathaway with her sly personality and actions created a very good character, but the 'suit' scenes were the weak point of her performance I feel. I hoped Catwoman wouldn't be the major focus and I was pleased, she was a burglar, not a superhero. That, actually, is what I feared the most. Adding two companions to Batman's already strong group with Alfred and Gordon could easily dull their screen time. Gary Oldman once again brought a very emotional and strong role. With Gordon being taken out and staying in the background for most of the duration seemed to add weight to his performance. Alfred was placed in a similar role, doing a fantastic job of bringing the tears when he was in the frame. Michael Caine has proved himself to be a master actor, and even in a small role he brings a presence that only he can. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in a very good showing as John Blake, though how certain he was that Wayne was Batman struck me as a little off. For Gordon not to know with large amounts of face time between both sides of Wayne and Blake to know immediately...it wasn't badly written, just made Blake look exceptionally sharp. Which is likely how the character was intended to be. I did buy him as both an officer and a detective, as did Batman, who took him in almost immediately. I liked their banter and even though the character wasn't 'Robin' as seen in the comics, he was a fitting helper to Batman and one that had his trust. Blake had a triumphant final act, as he was charged to save as many citizens as possible while facing military opposition. Levitt was the standout in a stacked film, as his character gained strength as the film went on. The finale, while in reality three separate endings, was his shining moment. What better compliment to the strength of an actor than to (presumably) place him in line for the next film? Of course, the direction of the franchise remains to be seen and it wouldn't shock me if this canon was disregarded completely. I hope that doesn't happen. The action scenes, especially the fights between Batman and Bane, are jarring and large. That's the moment I wanted to see, and it came much earlier than I expected. The epic showdown between the stars. The nods to Bane's actions in the Knightfall storyline - using Wayne's long layoff being the catalyst for his failing to succeed, goading Batman into a fight he wasn't ready for - these provided the same feeling I had reading issue #497 some nineteen years ago. I felt the time Wayne spent in the prison was a bit bloated, I know that he needed to rehab his back and literally climb out of hell but it did take some time. That's my only real issue with the film, the five months that Bane ruled the city and Wayne suffered in prison seemed lacking as there was no pressing of time. Wayne is successful in making the impossible climb and as he suddenly - and without any type of explanation - reappears in Gotham, the time scale materializes. The final act simply didn't have it for me. Miranda Tate's sudden turn and quick demise did nothing for me, which is why I haven't mentioned her character. Marion Cotillard was fine in her role, but her character disappeared suddenly and I was forced to embrace this new role and back story without the time to fully accept it. By the time I did, she was gone. Batman's ending made sense by the forced ending of a trilogy. Killing two characters while giving a suitable explanation as to how Wayne survived was okay, I had a lingering feeling throughout that Bale would not truly die. Didn't seem appropriate. The act gave Batman brought his credibility to a wounded city, while I assume Wayne would not be mentioned again. Bane's death was anticlimactic, he was moments away from killing Batman when Kyle silently drove up and shot him. The blast would have killed anyone, so instead of an epic end to the villain he was just quickly disposed of. These small issues I had with the film did nothing to lessen its impact, my eyes were glued to the screen both the first and second viewings. For the final film in a trilogy, the plot points were nicely wrapped up and new characters successfully introduced and ended. At the base level, the film is very complete. I have jumped around in my review but in closing, I loved nearly every moment and am fully happy by what I saw. The actors couldn't have been better, Bale is Batman. For all I'm concerned he will be Batman."
44,"This is a great movie in line with the last two.Great performance by Gary Oldman. I think the biggest role was from Tom Hardy, shame he wasn't able to show his face for much of the movie.The only fault with it is Bane's super-loud voice, it makes no sense to have that kind of sound in an open space it sounds like it was speaking from a sound booth.It even made me wonder if the voice was from Patrick Stuart. Cat woman's ears were very cool as did the bike used by Batman and Catwoman.Besides that it was great."
45,I love that this is all one big action sequence it really keeps you on your toes with a lord of the rings type war story for the climax a good movie for someone who looks for a thrill.
46,Once more and for the final time Christopher Nolan manages to pull it off as we can add another well told story in the Dark Knight Rises.Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale) has left the vigilantly which is Batman behind him and is on the verge of bankruptcy. Meanwhile a new criminal is arising called Bane (Tom Hardy) who's plot will threaten he safety of Gotham. Batman will be forced to come out of hiding and will need the help of a cat burglar but things become more complicated when there is another plotter behind the evil plan. The pacing is slightly off for the first 45 minutes and a couple of plot holes crept in but it did not effect the story overall. Tom Hardy steals the show and the fact that you can barely see his face did not knock the effectiveness of his chilling presence when ever in a scene which just boasts his ability as a actor. It would be a crime to forget Anne Hathaway who provided the key role as Selina Kyle.With some great camera work and fairly decent fight routines between Bale and Hardy the final installment is a overwhelming success.
47,"First of all, when I was in the theater watching (The Dark Knight) I said to myself that there's no way I'm going to miss the next movie in this series. after the epic nature and the overwhelming performance also the art of directing that makes you live inside the movie as we have seen in The Dark Knight, I expected this one to be at least the same level and I was absolutely correct. Christopher Nolan is the best Director out there, the way he makes you become part of the movie and feel the same feeling of every character you see is just magical, and add to that the fantastic music of Hans Zimmer, not to mention the Perfect Selection of the Actors and Actresses in this movie. Before The Dark Knight all of us used to watch super hero movies and consider them the kind of thing that would never happen in real life but things changed after the epic clash between batman and the Joker, The Dark Knight Rises even make it more reasonable it makes you think that if there was a batman he would be exactly like this. and it is being proved in each scene as you go through the movie, how hard it is to live with the cruelty of bane, how it is really hard to find weapons and devices to use that they use everything they got (unlike other action movies that everyone suddenly have a 100 gun when it is time to fight) it is like what would really happen if Bane came to your city and Batman was to defend it. in other words you can call this movie a masterpiece,if you didn't watch it yet then what are you waiting for?"
48,"I can finally say my day has come. No longer do I have to sift through supposed story leaks and speculate what could happen in Christopher Nolan's last chapter in his Batman trilogy. Dallas press has now seen ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Everybody wants to know if the wait was worth it. I'm happy to say I walked away pleased with the outcome. As much as I would love to put a synopsis for the movie here, I don't want to spoil one single little plot point or moment of your personal experience viewing it. I'll say this much and leave well enough alone. Batman battles Bane and it's awesome! Catwoman is involved as well. That's all the details you're getting from me. Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan, and David S. Goyer penned an emotional and complex final act. Just to give comic book geeks a little extra hint at what to expect, imagine the Batman story arcs ""Knightfall,"" ""No Man's Land,"" and a slight sprinkle of ""Gates of Gotham"" all mashed together. Things get a little sluggish about 30 minutes in when the story is being developed, but I can't complain. At least the writers care about a story. One thing I can say about ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is it's an emotional journey. I found myself excited and anxious at parts. Other scenes left me with a feeling of sorrow. It's also an emotionally confusing film. Things I thought I wouldn't be alright with going into the theater I ended up feeling good about walking out. The first appearance of Batman in the film is one of those scenes where you can barely contain yourself. You want to jump out of your seat yelling and clapping your hands. I was in a press screening and there were a few people clapping when he makes his grand entrance. Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane is spot on and frightening. He's not just a crazed psychopath, but one with a mission and purpose. He's Batman's strongest adversary when it comes to strength. Bane's not all brawn and no brains, either. It takes an intelligent mind to pull off the things he does. One thing I want to make perfectly clear is he's in a completely different class than the Joker. There's really no comparison between the two. Anne Hathaway does a great job with the character of Catwoman and Selina Kyle. She can turn the charm off and on like a faucet. One moment she's an innocent bystander and the next she transforms herself into a skilled and arrogant jewel thief. The rest of the cast delivers in their individual parts. Gary Oldman returns as Commissioner Gordon and pours his heart and soul into the character the way he always has. Joseph Gordon Levitt is perfect as officer John Blake, who believes in Batman and stands behind Gordon in his call to keep the streets of Gotham clean. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the movie Batman enthusiasts are hoping for going into it. There's no possible way that any fan of the Caped Crusader will walk out of the theater without a smile on their face. A few cameo appearances by characters also add more fun to the movie. It serves as an excellent bookend to Christopher Nolan's wildly popular trilogy."
49,"The Dark Knight Rises is a story of hope. Be it the false hope Bane gives Gothamites, the hope Bruce Wayne has for the city, the hope Alfred has for Bruce to leave Gotham and have a good life, the hope John Blake and Jim Gordan have of seeing the Dark Knight return, or the hope Selina Kyle has of starting anew. This movie is an epic, perfectly written, directed and just overall brilliant end to in my opinion one of the best trilogies ever made. This hope the movie offers the audience is not only enticing, but makes us want to see what we hope to see. To how we want this to end. This is indeed a highly under rated film, and in my opinion The Dark Knight just surpasses its successor for two reasons: the depth of the story, and more than that, Heath Ledger. And it was only cause of his tragic death did that movie even get nominated or win so many awards, including even Ledgers perfect performance. Im sure if he had lived, he wouldn't have gotten half the recognition he did get, and which he did deserve. Its cause of over commercialization that this movie didn't receive the recognition it deserves, like many other superhero movies, only this one was definitely one of the best like it's predecessor. And the ending did give us hope, which made for a perfect ending to Christopher Nolan's astounding Dark Knight trilogy."
50,"You can all rest easy now.. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the 3rd and final movie of the Christoper Nolan-directed trilogy and it was a great feeling seeing it finish in grand fashion.There was no way it was going to surpass ""The Dark Knight"" and the iconic performance of Heath ledger as the ""The Joker"", but it comes incredibly close and mostly delivers with the assistance of ""Bane""; the last major villain of the franchise. Actor Tom Hardy does the role justice as the voice itself is creepy and haunting and sets the tone of the entire film, as Batman is caught in the darkest of struggles.Then there's Anne Hathaway's portrayal of ""Catwoman"" which surprised me and added a bit of fun to the otherwise dark film, however she doesn't surpass the utter brilliance of Michelle Pheifer's ""Catwoman"" in Tim Burton's ""Batman Returns"" which is still the definitive version of the character.All in all the movie was a lot of fun to watch since we've all been waiting to see how it all ends, and trust me it was well worth the wait! I congratulate Christopher Nolan for making a trilogy that is connected beginning to end and is now the most compelling take on the ""batman"" that we've ever witnessed on the big screen."
51,"'The Dark Knight Rises' is the third and final instalment in Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking trilogy that reshaped the superhero genre as we know it. The main cast return as well as some newcomers. Tom Hardy as 'Bane', Anne Hathaway as 'Selina', Joseph Gordon-Levitt as 'Blake' and Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda'.
The new additions are fantastic, especially Tom Hardy. He brings a menacing presence to the character and finally incorporates the main part of his comic counterpart, his brains. For sure Bane is incredibly strong, but he is also an unbelievable strategist that can systematically wear down Batman whilst also using his strength to defeat him. Hardy displays all of this perfectly despite us barely seeing his face, the mask he wears makes him more frightening and is used as an interesting plot device later in the film. A lot of people criticised the voice that Hardy uses for this character, but personally I love it, I think adds to the mystery of the figure.
The best acting comes from Michael Caine as 'Alfred Pennyworth'. Nolan really fleshes out Alfred and Bruce's relationship in this film and Caine plays the reluctant mentor figure perfectly. One of his final scenes really shows off his acting, the regret that Alfred pours out and it's heartbreaking. Whilst all of the other actors are great, Caine excels in this movie compared to 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'.
The writing is brilliant, so many twists and turns and a sensational ending that really brings the trilogy full circle and has a great ending to Bruce's arc. The dialogue is excellent, in particular the many Bane monologues that add another layer onto his great character. The fight choreography improves massively and is loads better than the last two films. Hanz Zimmers score is superb and works in all scenes that it features in. Also, the cinematography is beautiful, Wally Pfister, who has worked with Nolan throughout the trilogy, really peaks in this picture.
However, this movie isn't perfect, Bane's final demise is very underwhelming, especially for a character that makes as much of an impact as he does. Finally the twist at the end with Blake feels tacked on and is inaccurate to the source material.
Overall, I love this movie, for sure it doesn't live up to the heights of 'The Dark Knight' but it is still exceptional and was a stunning way to end this unbelievable series of films.9/10"
52,"Christopher Nolan was assigned with the job of coming out with a new Batman movie comparable to The Dark Knight. Did he succeed? In short, yes. Is it better than The Dark Knight? No. But is it incredible, awesome, and everything we could have hoped for? Yes. This movie would be the best Batman movie and even one of the best movies ever if Heath Ledger wouldn't have put on the face paint. That's what I think is the biggest difference between the movies. While Tom Hardy's Bane is very very well done and flat out frightening at times, nobody can top Ledger's Joker. But don't think for a second that TDKR is any worse because of that.The Dark Knight Rises brings the biggest threat of all three movies to Gotham in the form of Bane. Bane is Batman's biggest threat he's ever had physically and forces Bruce Wayne to return as Batman after entering an isolated state. Much less happens in this movie than in the previous two and I think it's because of the villains. In Batman Begins, Batman had to fight the Mob, Scarecrow, and Ras Al Ghul. In The Dark Knight, Batman had to fight the Mob, The Joker, and Two-Face. In The Dark Knight Rises, Batman has to fight Bane, and only Bane. From beginning to end, all Batman has to do is figure out how to defeat Bane and stop him from finishing his evil plot. While Batman Begins is some what lessened in genius because it has to tell the origin story of Batman, and The Dark Knight is just obviously amazing to everyone who sees it, The Dark Knight Rises has more of a hidden genius. Most people will miss all the symbols and why this movie is so brilliant and such a masterful ending to the Dark Knight's Legacy. There's so much I wish I can say, but I don't want to spoil it for you. All I should say is see it. See it and be amazed by it. 10 Stars out of 10."
53,"Review: the Nolan bale Batman trilogy ends here on a literal explosive note and in a spectacular fashion. There was doubt that this take on Batman would survive the notorious ""third movie curse"" but for the most part it succeeds.Takeaways:
thank goodness that WB and Christopher Nolan decided to not stretch this film series to 10 + number of films, and decided to ultimately the the beginning middle end trilogy structure.The movie takes elements from some of The most famous Batman Comic storylines such as Knightfall, no man's Land, and Even, Frank miller's the Dark Knight Returns.Christian bale gives a great final performance as the aging Bruce Wayne. Eight years after the fall and death of Harvey dent which he decided to volunarily take the blame for to protect dent's image, he had retired from Batman now that Gotham has become peaceful. However he is still depressed because of the death of his love interest Rachel Dawes and his plan to be together with her went up in smoke. He must now deal with new enemy, Bane and must unretire and become the dark knight again. I loved how bale portrayed Bruce Wayne's pain and aging wisdom, while also trying to find personal redemption after the events of the dark knightTim Hardy IS Bane. A new villian, who was once part of the old group that Bruce trained with, the league of shadows. Bane had also formed his own band of militia mercenaries to enact his plan to destroy Gotham as his mentor, Ra's Al Ghul had intended, to ""cleanse"" the evil and corruption from it. I love his mask, and the fact that he is strong and intelligent. Also he breaks Batman first!I loved Marion Voltaire as Bruce's new love interest, business woman Miranda Tate. However she is not who she really claims to be...Spoiler: I had a feeeling she was going to be revealed as new Legue of shadows Leader...Talia Al Ghul, that daughter of Bruce's teacher, Ra's Al Ghul. Great twist. Though her reveal was short.Anne Hathaway was great as the latest to portray the anti-heroine feline theif Catwoman/Selina Kyle. I loved her first moment where we saw her true voice and I loved her scenes with Batman. We also see the famous love romance between the two.Sit Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan freeman also pull off great performances, as well as newcomer Joseph Gordon levitz who plays important character Officer John Blake. (Spoiler: it turns out that his real first name is ""Robin"")Conclusion: you will never get tired of watching this as well as the first two Nolan Batman movies. This trilogy well go down as one of the best ones, of the comic book movies and in history. It has a very satisfying ending that will please almost every single fan of these Batman movies."
54,I sat down last night on New Years Eve replacing the festivities with a big blockbuster that I was looking forward to watching. One word to describe it is disappointing. It just does not reach the heights of the second film and the main reason for that is the villain. This is not the fault of the 3rd film really as Heath Ledger was just fantastic in the 2nd film. It is that Bane is just so one dimensional in comparison and that is not down to Tom Hardy in any way. There just needed to be more mystique and terror around him but he was just a big lump with a fairly incoherent and gruff voice. And Catwoman? Sorry but Anne Hathaway is just not good enough to play this role and her turn to be at Wayne's side at the end-preposterous. And Blake to be Robin was telegraphed from the moment he came on the screen. AND all the police force to get caught down the sewers-ppllleeaasse no. BUT it was worth 8 out of 10 as it was a spectacular blockbuster let down by a little weakness in the plot and one dimensional characterisation.
55,"To stat off I am a Nolan fan-boy so do expect a bit of a bias here - my first impression of TDKR was NOT wow (which was the case with TDK) I mean i loved the movie but it did not have so many things that its predecessor had - no joker, no awesome truck flip or the skyhook scene. no intelligent crosses like when joker sends batman to Harvey dent instead of Rachel. But despite all this, this movie had something else, something which believe lead so many people to not really appreciate it. That was its heart, its a story about Bruce Wayne, story about how he has to keep going, how it shouldn't matter that Rachel is dead or hes past his prime (make no mistake he is an aging man and not a comic character who is stuck in his thirties since over 70 years) He needed to be reminded of his true purpose and bane did just that. It made perfect sense, he learnt of his purpose due to Ra's AL ghul and if there is anyone who can re-iterate that it has to be the league of shadows itself.I think everyone should give this movie another shot, without the nitpicking, I guarantee that you will love it."
56,"Got to watch it in a preview show here in India. Was stunned with the way Nolan has narrated the story. It is simply AWESOME! Everything looks so perfect here, right from the starting, till the end credits roll. Even though i am not an ardent fan of action/superhero movies, I liked the first two installments of the series, so the expectation for this was so huge. And to be frank, i am happy with the outcome. Ii is brilliant in every aspect. Nolan's direction is top-notch and he is the real hero of the movie. I even felt goosebumps in certain sequences. I do not want to reveal the story much, but what i can say is, this one is a must for every movie lover. Such an awesome performance from Tom Hardy! I was just amazed to see him perform Bane. Christian Bale is no less, he is literally perfect reprising his role from the previous two films. The other actors have done good job. But i missed Heath Ledger, may his soul rest in peace. Anyway, what i have to say is, do not miss this film, lest it is a real loss for you. I would like to rate it 8.5/10, And Hats off to Nolan and the entire crew for giving us such a cinematic experience."
57,"Another achievement by Nolan Bros. and Warner Bros... Thanks to its huge budget available (ca 230 million USD) one could use state-of-the-art technology and employ a dream-team of actors of different generations: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt... And they got the opportunity to have elaborated roles to play, not just appearing in the background; Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth is probably the finest of the great ones. Moreover, it is no comic strip movie, but an epic story of universal values, attitudes and issues, with superhero and sci-fi moments complementing the script, not governing it.Minuses from me due to length (ca 2,5 hours) and too obvious references/comparisons with characters from other hit movies (e.g. Hannibal, Catwoman, James Bond). But still, the movie is worth watching and recommendable!"
58,"As the ending chapter in the trilogy I enjoyed this movie the most. It had more of Bruce Wayne than just Batman. It showed Bruce's face behind the Batman mask and did so believably. Like we all know the Joker took the spotlight in the previous film and the first one was more Batman action. So we got a trilogy with a balanced focus between the guise, the seamlessly corrupt and the person behind the guise. Which is nice.As a movie about the struggling person behind the mask this was, for me, the most touching out of the three films. And the most hope inducing, seeing Bruce Wayne recollect himself from the pit and rise to stand on his own feet. Re-mustering his courage and will."
59,"I would like to suggest that researching anything to deep about this film is a bad idea. Go into it with a clean slate. The experience will be ruined for you if you do not.REVIEW IN SUMMARY:The movie was phenomenal. It never slows, and I was surprised it was over when the time came. If you've disliked the pacing of past Nolan films, you will be fine with this one. This movie has incredible acting, a beautiful story, and is the perfect end to the Trilogy. FULL REVIEW:For starters, the Nolan brothers have created a masterpiece of a script. The themes explored in this film are stirring, and inspiring. The story is beautiful, and full of depth. Those of you looking for a simple mindless thriller will probably find this film to be, ""alright"", but you won't get the hype behind it. You won't understand everyone's obsession with this film. If you haven't liked Nolan's previous work, you won't like this one. It's not about the action, or the simple mindless battles many superhero movies today are all about. It's not as simple as those are. But do not despair, there is more large scale action in this then any of the other Batman films thus far. But, it is easy to follow. Even if you haven't seen the other movies in the franchise you will understand it. The other movies add depth, so I suggest you see the other two films before you see this one, but all the same you'll be able to follow it.Chris Nolan tells the story well. It wasn't as choppy and unorganized as some of his past films. This one is by far his best work.Tom Hardy brings an elegance to the villain of Bane that is addicting. Yes, you read right, and elegance. Class. He is a classy villain, whose motivations are understandable, and frighteningly relatable. This is, in my opinion, his best work aside from Warrior. As far as comparisons to the Joker go, it's like comparing an apple to an orange. Except when you bight into Bane, and the threat he presents, you'll forget the Joker even existed.Anne Hathaway won't be disappointing. I know I, like many of you, was worried when we saw that name on the cast list. But she does fine.This movie will stir your emotions. Satisfy your need for action. Satisfy your need for Batman. And satisfy your need for insurmountable villains. It will also satisfy those who have read the comics. Although this story does not follow in exactness to any original comic, Nolan cleverly manipulates the characters to fit the comic agenda, in a more ""modern"" or ""realistic"" sense. This film is full of surprises. So I suggest you stop reading these reviews, avoid potential spoilers, and go enjoy the show."
60,"And we end off with a...... Bang?Not really...but there are still moments from this movie that i enjoy and that id anne hathaway and that's about it haha.I think the ending is cheesy (other then when Gordon finally finds out who batman is)the villain should have been Ras Al Ghul, it would've been a huge callback to the first film and it would've made Batman's ""death"" a bigger success and twist when it's revealed he isn't actually dead at the end of the filmgood overall, worst entry though."
61,"The action was pretty mediocre at best. The plot was decent but most things were pretty predictable. Even the ""surprise"" evil villain at the end was predictable. During the movie I turned to my girlfriend and said ""$20 says she ends up being a bad guy at the end."" needless to say I got a pat on the head later.Is the movie good? Yes. Is the movie great? Depends.... it is great for the fans of the movies but in general its not a masterpiece. I feel it deserve a 8 on IMDb at the very best. The fact that its so high rated right now is pretty unrealistic.Everyone saying Bane was the greatest villain of all time with amazing acting? I disagree... I still think Heath did a better job as the Joker. I feel Bane was a cool character but I don't feel he at all lived up to the hype provided in other reviews.The movie is a must see for the year, but it is something you can watch on DVD and still get the same effect. No idea how they spent so much money on this movie... the action wasn't that good."
62,"First things first. Bane is not the Joker. While the Joker was chaotic,Baneis a mercenary. Ruthless and destructive. When the prologue was shown during MI4, many had voiced concerns about the muffled voice of Bane.That has been corrected to an extent.For those who don't follow comic books,Bane is the villain who broke the bat. And Tom Hardy has done justification to Bane. Mind you when there is a mask covering your face and you sound as a megaphone, it makes your job a little difficult. But his physical presence and his eyes expresses what needs to be expressed. Before you walk into the theatre, ensure that you seen the previous two films from the trilogy as the story of TDKR is interconnected to both and you may feel lost if you haven't seen them. For those who have , it wouldn't harm to review those films again. Whilst The Dark Knight earned respect and love from worldwide audience mostly due to fact that Heath Ledger was brilliant as the Joker. And his character shines way above Batman's or the story itself, TDKR on the other hand relies more on the story and the inter-relationship of the characters.Nolan stands true to his word. It is an EPIC conclusion to the Batman trilogy. it is worthy of multiple viewings and I would suggest an IMAX viewing if possible. The scenes, the canvas are breathtaking. So are all the action scenes and of course Mr.Zimmer on the keyboard. The soundtrack fits right into the scenes and enhances the visual experience. The newly added star cast further adds to that experience and fit right into the master puzzle that Nolan has created while his old allies ensure that the movies moral compass is pointed in the right direction. The movie justifies its length of 165 mins and you won't realise how fast they went. For me the experience would have been far more richer had I not seen Inception or any other Nolan films. Let me explain. Many of the movie scenes are executed and directed on the same lines as Inception. And since I understand how Nolan's concept works, I knew all the twist and turns before they were revealed barring one. The element of surprise wasn't there for me. TDKR is a must watch. And it is a just end to the best comic book adapted movie series ever. Enjoyed it and loved it. Rating 8/10."
63,"Following a movie event like Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is a dangerous game, but then Nolan is a dangerous player. His curious obsession with masculine identity, psychological schisms and the dark night of the soul gave ""Batman Begins"" (2005) a sense of edgy 'reality' that ingratiated him to critics and a good deal of the public, even if it alienated some hard-core Batfans with its customized and highly Nolan-esque take on the Caped Crusader. When his second installment braved the frontier of openly post-9/11 superhero parables, and in so doing gave the late Heath Ledger platform to truly wow audiences and critics the world over, the British director seemed to have galvanized 'superhero noir' as the new benchmark in comic book film adaptation. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) is his final word on the subject, and while this reviewer feels that it is not a film fit to win over any dissenters or greatly deter any fanatics, it is very largely successful in what it tries to do and its failings are certainly not for a lack of trying.The first hour or so of the film is a whirlwind of plot necessities that, despite the running time of 165 minutes, probably needed another half an hour or so to unfold with sensicality. They involve introductions to John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - a rookie cop raised in a city orphanage who apparently ""still believes in the Batman"", even though as far as the audience is concerned he may as well have just moved to Gotham last week – Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) – a cat-burglar who is therefore Catwoman – and Miranda Tate (Marion Cottilard) – a high society Gothamite monetarily invested in a renewable energy program at Wayne Enterprises that has apparently gone bust, even though it seems to work just fine. Excusing a twist in the tale that seems to be there for its own sake, however, Nolan and his co-screenwriter (also known as his brother Jonathan) do not really abide loose ends, and by the commencement of the film's some hour-long climax all the story elements that feel disparate and murky in the beginning have intertwined and solidified into the kind of philosophically powerhouse narrative that made the first two films so effective.What makes the Nolan films effective is how they appropriated the inalienable tenets of the Batman legend in pursuit of an apocalyptic allegory about the post-9/11 western world. ""Batman Begins"" was a film about fear; the double edged nature of fear's power over a people and how the conquering of fear is invaluable for the pilgrimage of moral valor. ""The Dark Knight"" was a film about Terror, the kind George Bush Jr. declared war against in the early twenty-first century, and about how the greatest tool against Terror is the adherence to moral principles, even if sacrifice and compromise must be allowed for.""The Dark Knight Rises"" provides a more accurate depiction of terroristic motives in its central villain of Bane than the ""The Dark Knight"" did with The Joker, because he holds Gotham in contempt for its status as a symbol of American first-world 'imperialism'. There has been some critical backlash against Bane as a Villain Without A Face, but this severely undermines Tom Hardy's performance, which actually achieves remarkable presence through nothing but body-language, vocal theatricality and disturbingly expressive eyes. Even without a face, Hardy effortlessly paints a convincing portrait of one who wants to dismantle the lie of Harvey Dent's legacy and incite Gotham into class-warfare riots. He purports to ""liberate"" Gotham's people, but his ultimate goal is to feed Gotham false hope before destroying the whole darn thing and everyone in it. Bane's genuine ideological conflict with western civilization is centered around the power of hope in the eventuation of despair. More than it is a film about fear or Terror, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a film about hope.In accord with the rest of the trilogy, Bruce Wayne is not the only protagonist whose arc is built around the movie's central thematic concepts. Even the arc supplied for Selina Kyle ends up justifying her seemingly arbitrary insertion into this filmic imagining by providing a suitably dubious object of moral faith for the fallen Dark Knight. She begins with similar outlook to Bane, but the Nolans don't buy into Ra's Al Ghul's assertion that criminals aren't complicated. Everyone, and everything, is complicated.Oddly enough, it's this principle that is behind most of the shortcomings of the film. It's a little *too* complicated, with the rushed series of first-act events seriously paling in comparison to the emotional impact of the conclusion, and an aforementioned twist that doesn't make much sense. There are also a lot more impossible feats performed by Bruce Wayne here than before, including a near-superhuman healing ability. And where ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" stood alone very effectively, one can't help but feel that both films are practically required viewing for this one.But none of that really outweighs the sheer, touching veracity of this finale and its philosophical/moral ambitions, which are all up to par with the predecessors and pay off a great deal of things with a genuine craftsmanship. This ""Batman"" series has always been about the power of symbols in a corrupted world and personal accountability in a society of structural shackles, and when Batman returns to Gotham at the top of the final act to brand his symbol in flames upon the city's largest bridge structure, we are reminded of the paradoxical purity of his message. Even as part of a system that is broken, even funded by a wealth that would perhaps do more good dispersed amongst the third world, even if no one ever knows his name, the Batman fights for the goodness of fallen people (be they cops, cat-burglars or orphans) who may otherwise have never had the chance to rise."
64,"That Completes the trilogy.. Just came out from 'The Dark Knight Rises'...Not as mesmerizing as The Dark Knight ,but still Christopher Nolan executed a legendary ending to the series with breathtaking visual moments and fine performances..the movie takes off slowly ,bt the racy 2nd half s just stunning...Hans Zimmer 's score is brutal, percussive and ma ear drums was busting , the Bane Chant wherever he used was goosebumps..Christian Bale continued his legacy in the third part too.. Tom Hardy was a beefy substitute for Heath Ledger in a hell of a villain as the merciless and destructive evil.. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman reprise's there roles as strong as it's been throughout the series.. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a fair job as the detective and he s a promising actor and the shocking 'Rise' was Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda Tate'..Anne Hatheway as CatWoman was just a sidekick and nothing much performance wise from her We may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine.Nolan had ended on his own terms..If plans arise to reboot the ""Batman"" films a few years from now, I wish you luck. The bar is as high as it could possibly be... Must Watch for all Dark Knight and Nolan and movie lovers..!!"
65,"You just don't watch a Nolan movie. You experience it. Something happens inside you after you're done watching any of his movies.The Dark Knight Rises is not just a movie, its a baggage of expectations, its a sequel to The Dark Knight, it has been directed by Chris Nolan, it has the Batman and people have already started with their assumptions and speculations.Does the movie survive all this?Yes. Definitely yes.Batman Begins dealt with fear. The Dark Knight dealt with chaos. The Dark Knight Rises deals with pain.Eight years have been passed since the demise of Harvey Dent. Batman had hung up the boots and started blaming himself for Harvey's Death and everything. With all the injuries he had sustained while fighting under that bat suit and the depression, he is no longer the Bruce Wayne Gotham knows. People have been questioning his sanity. Wayne empire is declining.In comes Bane. The dark, brutal, masked and monolithic beast who almost destroys Wayne enterprises to seek Batman.Selina Kyle, a female burglar who teases Bruce Wayne with her attitude and activities. As a result, Batman is forced to come back. What follows is the series of events that not only blow your mind away but cast a magical spell to last the full life time.There are a several new players that have been introduced in the film, such as Wayne's love interest and the new age cop John Blake who does the job of being the good side kick of Gordon and plays in an important role in convincing Bruce Wayne to be back as the caped crusader to protect Gotham one last time from the terror of Bane and army.So is The Dark Knight Rises better than The Dark Knight? If you were one of those fans who prefer Batman Begins to TDK then you'll find much to love about TDKR. And if you weren't then no Batman film will ever match TDK for you.As both Batman and Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale's work here is master- class, and he gives the character such an inescapable melancholy – a certain perseverance in the face of absolute resignation to his fate – that he becomes a more tragic figure than ever. That said, he's aided enormously by a never-better Michael Caine, who turns with hope and palpable love what might otherwise be expository dialogue into searing, supportive criticisms of Wayne's self-destruction. On the other hand, after being marketed as heir to the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" Tom Hardy's Bane is a different sort of villain – a focused and more ideologically-developed version of Heath Ledger's Joker – but one with equally ruthless charm.While she doesn't quite steal the show as Heath Ledger's Joker did, Hathaway's Catwoman is a magnetic presence whenever she's on screen and she has great chemistry with Bale. Selina may be the proverbial good bad girl, the thief with a heart of gold, but Hathaway imbues her with a wounded spirit and a survivor's edge that makes her feel genuine and sympathetic even when she's being naughty.That being said, the acts of good old Gary Oldman and the power house Joseph Gordon Levitt cannot be ignored. Christopher Nolan is in peak time of his life. Whatever he is touching is turning into gold. He has taken The Batman series to a level which no one in thousand years can reach. The action scenes, the rise and the fall of all the characters along with the climax are just the pieces of the puzzle, which in the end you feel was taking shape since the day Batman Begins released. The first hour ties all the loose ends the first two movies left behind and the climax is so apt that you leave the theater feeling contended and satisfied.We may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine. Nolan had something special to say with his time in the trenches, and he's ended on his own terms. I wonder which series Nolan decides to reboot next!"
66,"First of all you should watch Batman Begins and Dark Knight before this. This movie gets back to events of both of those movies. This is not as good as previous movies because this has few things that feel so stupid that you start to think why they are on movie.Batmans war tactics seem to be from before World War I and this movie seems to have some kind of fair fist fight fixation. Police seems to be stupid and doing things that makes no sense only because plot requires it.Another annoying thing is messing with time space continuity. In real life characters can't move that fast between places they seems to do this movie. Unnecessary time limit at the end is one of those too convenient things.Bane is quite interesting. His master plan is not. There is no motivation for what makes him do things he do. Movie would have benefit better explanations of motives.Catwoman is not called Catwoman in this movie and she has too little part for my liking.Best things about movie is how it ties story lines from first two movies and shows why good ideas from earlier movies weren't so good after all. Good ending to great trilogy. If characters motivations were explained better and they wouldn't done few of those stupid things, this would have been on level of previous ones."
67,"Nolan has created a Pulp Masterpiece. With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Nolan set out to get Batman back to his gritty roots. With Rises, Nolan slowly backs out of the grittiness and enters a pulpier realm. A Bondian realm that begins with a mid-air high-jacking. Has a villain that wears a mask 99% of the film. Batman and Catwoman fighting side by side only to be stopped by gunfire from henchmen so incompetent they can only hit their own comrades rather than hitting their intended targets. And of course a nuclear bomb countdown. Nolan clearly has a love for James Bond films (as he also showed with Inception). As a fellow Bond aficionado, I really appreciate this, and it only adds to my overall enjoyment of the film. Superhero movies generally follow a particular formula. I could predict the plot beats of most of the recent Marvel films (this is not a complaint of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, just an observation). The point is that this film (as its predecessor did) threw me more surprises than most films of this genre typically do. And my expectations were blown away. TDKR has a very intricate structure, and for being 165 minutes long, the movie flies by at a nice pace. Nolan's film has the feeling of a Coppola-sized epic from the 1970s, with its plot complexity, large cast of characters, intricate dialogue scenes with equal helpings of pain and tragedy. Many scenes in the film are shot in an orange/sepia tone that reminds me of The Godfather Part II. Tom Hardy's Bane is a mythical, Kurtz-like antagonist. The film has subtext and some political satire, one can interpret that how they will. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" could very well be the most polarizing film of Nolan's career thus far, hopefully the debate will continue."
68,"The Dark Knight trilogy tells us a lot about Nolans understanding of modern cinema, as well as his control over the Batman franchise.It's not always obvious that Nolan is that interested in the hero genre, more with continuing the journey he started with Inception (along with much of the same cast). But the advantage of this is that the scenes with Batman and Bruce Wayne have no extra gravity to them, giving the chance for characters to develop.To a degree.Even approaching 3 hours, Nolan stretches his skill and that of the cast to rush through much of the plot, especially the back-stories that he isn't much interested in. This leads to the usual number of unexplained convergences, plot vacancies and narrative extended death scenes that plague most modern films. Yes, it drives the internet forums and people see the films again but this weakens cinema and strengthens the longer TV serials that attract so many film directors. Nolans exploration of identity (every character has a masked past, present or future) feels compressed here, fitted between the blowing up of the scenery.Looking through his, er, oeuvre, it is clear that Nolans interest in perception was best met by Christopher Priest with The Prestige. I can see Nolan and Priest combining again, but I can't see him trying another full action film - his disdain for the material is starting to surface."
69,"This will be a very underrated movie due to the amazingness of The Dark Knight. However, in many ways it is just as groundbreaking, philosophical, profound, and good as its predecessor. It won't necessarily surpass the masterpiece that the Dark Knight is, but it really comes awfully close. It is its own thing, and other than a few sequences midway through and towards the end, it is every bit a masterpiece of action-filmmaking as The Dark Knight. The way Nolan handled the introduction, background, and development of the new characters was a treat and very satisfying. The only difference between this and the Dark Knight really is that the weaknesses of The Dark Knight Rises are just more pronounced. With a few scenes edited out in the middle, it would be just as good. This movie has inspirational components to it, while The Dark Knight has more morality-oriented components to it. But they both contain bits of both."
70,"Christopher Nolan has finished up the Batman series in remarkable style. Where Batman Begins was about conquering fears and the Dark Knight was about traversing the fine line between order and madness; the Dark Knight Rises seems to be a movie about compromise and acceptance.It has been eight years since the death of Harvey Dent and Gotham has settled down into some semblance of peace. The main instigators of this crime-free age, however, have many scars for their trouble. Bruce Wayne ( Christian Bale ) is a reclusive cripple- with shot knees and scar tissue riddling his body. Commissioner Gordon ( Gary Oldman ) has found his career is now burdened by the lie that he and Batman wove to keep Harvey Dent's reputation spotless- so much so that he is separated from his family. Alfred ( Michael Caine ) despairs about Bruce Wayne's welfare- fearing that his master wants little more than a grand death. And Lucius Fox ( Morgan Freeman ) is attempting to stave Wayne Enterprises from bankruptcy thanks to all the money that Wayne has invested into Miranda Tate's ( newcomer Marion Cotillard ) renewable energy source.However a new threat emerges in the guise of Bane ( Tom Hardy )- a massive masked mercenary who has a connection to Batman's past. He claims to want a new Gotham where the 'have-nots' can rule over the 'haves' and bring true justice to the rich and corrupt. Alongside him is Selina Kyle ( Anne Hathaway ) a cat burglar who motives are enigmatic at best. It is therefore up to the old guard as well as idealistic cop John Blake ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) to try and hold Gotham together.Nolan has gone for bigger is better in his third movie of the trilogy and it certainly comes off as an sweeping, epic movie. Christian Bale probably gives his best performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman and the scenes he has with Caine's Alfred are particularly moving. Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are both very good also- with the scenes between Oldman and Gordon-Levitt ( probably the best of the newcomers ) nice to watch.But as good as the film is...it doesn't really seem to cover much more new ground. This isn't really helped by their choice of villain. Hardy does a good job as Bane, but he isn't helped by his breathing mask which makes him, at times, hard to understand. Furthermore, while Bane is shown to be dangerous, Nolan seems to be forcing the viewer to show how dangerous he is. Without the personal and affable menace of Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul or the twisted and frightening charisma of Ledger's Joker, Bane's most menacing moments come before the real action kicks off. Furthermore, it's difficult to see why anyone would want to follow him- utopia or not.As for Catwoman, Hathaway is very good in the role, but her character seems to be frustrating at times- seeming to just sit on the fence for the heck of it. Cotilliard's Miranda Tate is a fairly bland character that doesn't add much to the proceedings either.Furthermore, while the movie is indeed epic in scope, it sometimes gets lost in its own arcs in a way that the Dark Knight never did. The twists and turns that would have been seen as remarkable in the Dark Knight in this movie came across as almost unnecessary.Begins was a tight film that revolved around a single plot arc and holds together well. The Dark Knight was the true noir epic- a sweeping tale about morality and order in a insane city. The Dark Knight Rises is a flawed masterpiece- it's achievements not quite living up to the ambitions that it perhaps had. However, any Batman movie directed by Christopher Nolan is probably a good one. This is no exception."
71,"For a while, I maintained that this was the best of the Dark Knight trilogy. Watching it for the first time in a few years, I can certainly see why. The second half is pure spectacle filmmaking at an epic scale with an extended set piece that feels expansive and alive and huge all at once. However, that first hour or so is much messier, and I think that last half of the film, largely got me to ignore some of the niggling issues that frontend the film.The Batman has been absent from Gotham City for eight years. In that time, Gotham has seen a period of peace and prosperity it has not experienced in a very long time. In order to create that sense of calm, though, Police Commissioner Gordon pumped up the idol of Harvey Dent who had become the psychopathic villain Two-Face, murdered several people, and threatened to kill Gordon's son as the White Knight, blaming all of his crimes on Batman. Together with the Mayor and the City Council, they passed the Dent Act which allowed for aggressive anti-crime actions on the part of the police, resulting in a city without any serious organized crime at all. In this time, Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, has become a recluse, having spent several post-Batman years and half of his fortune pursuing a fusion reactor before suddenly shutting it down and closing himself off from the world.In enters Bane, a member of the League of Shadows and a former acolyte of Ra's Al Ghul, since excommunicated for his extreme methods. After the death of Ra's Al Ghul, Bane took over the League of Shadows and will continue the man's mission of burning Gotham to the ground, much like the League had done to Rome and London before it. The revolution he ignites is based heavily on the Jacobins of France during the French Revolution, which fits hand in hand with the overall movie's ties to Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. He speaks of equality, but he rules with an iron fist, establishing a Committee for Public Safety, so to speak, that summarily executes enemies of the revolution. In order to get there, though, Bane must take control of Gotham.Now, the first half of the film is really setup for the giant spectacle that dominates the second half, and some of it is quite good and other elements end up going a bit too far. From beginning to end, I think Bane is great. He's intimidating physically and he ends up with a great plan to acquire wealth and demean Batman at the same time. Stealing his fingerprints through Catwoman/Selina Kyle to fake reckless options trading that wipes out his position in Wayne Enterprises is wonderful. The chase out of the Stock Exchange, giving Bruce Wayne his first moment as Batman in eight years, is exciting and well filmed. That it leaves Wayne so destitute that he can't pay his own power bill is...curious and a step too far. I get the point. The point is to take Wayne as low as possible both as Batman and as Wayne himself, but having his power shut off because of nonpayment roughly a day after his loses all his money feels weird at best and completely ignorant of how things work in the real world at worst.Another very good thing that the first hour does is establish the overall thematic thrust of the film, and that's around pain. Bruce is suffering from a leg injury. That's good. He immediately gets cured well enough to fight as Batman again because of a gadget on his leg. That's...less good. And yet, the idea runs through the rest of it very well. Wayne carries the pain of his loss of Rachel Dawes, from The Dark Knight (to the point that people misinterpret his receding from the world due to that loss, but that's not the case). Gordon carries the pain of having to defend the man who tried to kill his son, while losing that son in a divorce at the same time. The city carries the scars of past trauma brought on by the Joker, but it manages to live on, just as Gordon does. And what do these people do with their pain? Well, more pain must come first.Bane's efforts to take the city end up feeling great. He has an inside man at Wayne Enterprises, also knows that Wayne is Batman because of his connection to the League of Shadows, and he uses the greed of Daggett, a wealthy executive who wants to absorb Wayne Enterprises, to prepare his plan of cutting off the city from the rest of the world. But first, he must take out the Batman. That the ""every police officer"" gets trapped in the sewars is...less good, though. It's another step too far that didn't quite need to be taken. However, this element of the plot is where Selena Kyle is useful.Anne Hathaway as Selena Kyle is really good. She can switch between woundedly scared and feminine to coyly vicious and feminine in an instant. She steals into Wayne Manor as a servant at a party and shows both sides to Bruce as she steals his mother's pearls and his fingerprints, setting up the plot of the film. She's a survivor with a chip on her shoulder, so she's happy to watch as Bruce loses everything as the result of her actions. However she does still have a certain sense of justice so when Bane completely takes over and Gotham descends into a hellscape reminiscent of the French Terror, she's bothered by it, but being a survivor she does little to stop or escape it.The movie turns when Batman has his confrontation with Bane. Evoking the famous comics scenario of Bane breaking Batman's back in the Knightfall run (pretty much the only time I was reading comics, by the way), Bane breaks Batman and sends him to a prison with hope, the worst punishment he can imagine. The visual image of Bruce needing to rise from the pit in order to overcome his pain and fear is great. That it takes him so much effort and that he has to essentially return to an earlier form of himself in order to do it is even better. There's such rich imagery here.The final confrontation between Batman, as a symbol of order, and Bane, as a symbol of chaos and fire, dominates the last half of the movie. The film leaves open some unimportant questions of how Bruce Wayne gets from India to Gotham in about three weeks, but considering the character's history of running in the underworld, including in the Far East, that seems easily filled in by the audience, and once he's there he leads an all out rebellion against the ruling Revolutionary government with an aim towards getting his hands on the nuclear bomb set to go off in twelve hours. Yeah, it's very comic booky, but it's handled with the right balance of seriousness that I think the movie sells the situation well.And in terms of the final act, the spectacle of Batman leading an army in a war against Bane for control of Gotham and against a Jacobin Revolution is great. Batman the symbol leads those who had cowered away in fear to take to the streets, fulfilling the promise of Batman as a symbol established in the first movie (and re-explained to Blake, the cop who has figured out that Wayne is Batman in...another individual step that feels too far in the first half). The evocation of A Tale of Two Cities also helps provide the film a literary understructure that I appreciate. It's not just random bad guys butting up against a protagonist we all know from pop culture. It's a literary extension of the mythos.I feel like this was a bit of a ramble, but I'm gonna stick with it. The Dark Knight Rises is not a perfect movie. Its first half ends up taking a few ideas too far, which undermines them slightly, but not the overall story. What ends up carrying it all, though, is Nolan's sheer command of everything outside the script. Performances are very good. The spectacle is great. The use of image and sound creates a large story that carries interesting ideas about pain and the efforts to deal with it. It's an intelligent and rousing film that could have been a bit tighter, but, by the end, I don't really care that much."
72,"Watched it first day, first show. I'm a huge fan of the series so was going to watch it anyway, whether it was good or bad because generally the conclusion of any epic series isn't that satisfying. But....we forget it's Christopher Nolan who has directed this. I was actually speechless for a long time after the movie finished. It's PHENOMENAL!!!It's worth every dime of your money and time spent (it's a long movie). It's full of stupefying, yet sensible, action, with an addition to Batman's armada of stunning vehicles. There are many twists and turns which keeps even the most seasoned of the audience guessing till a long time. All the acting is genuine (no question there!), the cinematography is bold and raw. Catwoman steals the hearts. And Bane, oh.. He is so bad and so tough! The direction is, as always, brilliant. In fact, Christopher Nolan has given everything he's got to this finale. It's dark, we can emotionally attach to, and feel, every situation and along with all this I would like to make the special mention of the music, the background score, by Hans Zimmer. I wouldn't be wrong in saying that this film wouldn't have got this legendary aura to it without the background music!So, in short, whether you've watched earlier parts or not, it's an at least a must watch movie, three times!"
73,"I'm writing this for one purpose and one purpose only. I know it's fashionable to hammer Anne Hathaway for her portrayal. But what do people expect from her exactly? Do they want her to puRRR constantly? Do they really expect her to camp it up? That would run contrary to Christopher Nolan's vision. No, she played it to the level of Nolan's vision. She's not camping it up. She's not playing it big. She injects fragility into the character that is very much in keeping with this iteration of Batman. She injects much needed humanity into this character.As for the movie, I have the same problem as the other 2. Too much explaining. That's why Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best. He did things just because he's crazy. No more explanation needed."
74,"First things first, don't watch the Rises without watching the Begins. You will surely miss the heart and soul of the movie.This movie is not about the action, the conflict, the villain or the hero. Nolan returns to the roots of this series by making Bruce learn more about fear. Bruce must learn the power of fear yet again, see it in a new way and learn to use it in a different way.The expected things are all there, the villain winning the first battle, hero returning stronger, nice twists, action and fist fights, new gadgets, effects. But don't let them blind you, look deeper and you would find the crowning jewel of this series.Another thing worth mentioning, the soundtrack is amazing!!"
75,"I'm going to start off by saying that this was probably one of my most anticipated movies of all time. I went in the theater hoping for a masterpiece. I actually expected this movie to jump into my top five of all time. It didn't disappoint, I loved it.The opening scene had me questioning what exactly was going on. Movies that make you think about the smallest details of the plot are my favorite. In the scene the audience is introduced to the new villain, Bane. As a kid watching cartoons I always thought that bane was a mindless hulk-like bad guy. In this movie he has a true to the comic's portrayal. He's smart, he has a plan, and he'll stop at nothing to put it into action. Much like Dark Knight, the Villain is a major standout. He has such an intimidating presence on screen. Tom Hardy put so much work into the physicality of the character. The first fight between Bane and Batman is one of the moments that they had to get right. Luckily it's one of my favorite moments in the entire film! In the scene they don't use too much sound, just Bane's taunts as he fights, truly frightening. His voice is so interesting. It's something you'll really remember about the film. After the film my friends and I couldn't help but do Bane impressions. He has so many quotable lines that he will probably be one of my favorite villains of all time. You might be wondering if he outperformed the Joker from Dark Knight. The answer is no, not quite. He's so different of a character it's hard to compare, but Joker was just too hard to beat. Christian Bale's performance as Batman and Bruce Wayne was amazing. This was easily his best performance as Batman. The story takes place eight years after the end of Dark Knight so Bruce is feeling the ill effects of being batman. He uses a cane now, and he has a little grey hair. This is a story about Bruce Wayne coming back, and doing anything he can for his city. Bruce and Alfred have some amazing scenes where you forget your watching acting. The emotion they both convey when they're together is stunning. Michel Cane doesn't have as much screen time as he does in the other movies, but he's so good in the ones he's in you won't forget his performance. Morgan Freeman is back. He has some particularly funny scenes with Bruce. They feel like old friends yet again. You really can't go wrong with any of the actors in this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays young police officer Blake. He has some great character development during the course of the movie. I was cheering for him the whole time. If you come out of this movie saying ""I just wish it had better acting"" I'd question your sanity. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was one big worry I had about the movie going in. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. She did a great job of portraying the playful vigilante. She actually had okay chemistry with Christian Bale. Catwoman wasn't forced into the story, her character made sense within the plot. She didn't ruin the movie, which was all I was asking for. Plus, she actually looked like she could fight. She wasn't doing the ""I'm a woman who can beat up ten men with one hand tied behind my back"" routine. It was such a relief that they didn't try to do something annoying like Black Widow from Avengers.The story was fantastic. It's amazing that Christopher Nolan wasn't planning on doing this movie before he made Batman Begins. There are so many callbacks and references to that movie I would strongly recommend watching that one again before you see this one. I kept saying ""Oh I remember when he said that!"" or thinking ""That ties in perfectly"". This one had plenty of twists and turns. Multiple times I was questioning what was true and what was a clever ruse. If there are any negatives, you might say there are some plot leaps. Not holes mind you, but something upon thinking about it you might consider a little unbelievable. With such huge story and scope I'm surprised there aren't more mistakes. The scale of this movie is far bigger than in either of the first two Batman movies. Bane has a plan for all of Gotham and batman has to stop an entire city of villains. The entire trilogy comes to a very fitting finish. I absolutely loved the ending. I was very satisfied how everything tied together. I especially loved the conclusion of Bruce's story, perfect. When I came out of the theater I couldn't wait to discuss the amazing things that happened in the end. This is a movie where the more you watch it the more you'll understand and enjoy it.Of course, in the conclusion to a trilogy like this one you would expect to be dazzled by the special effects. They were quite impressive. The new batwing has some pretty amazing aerial maneuvers. You definitely get your money's worth with the cinematography. The opening and ending scenes especially stand out. There was an extremely cool Bat Pod driving scene that, as soon as it was over, I wanted to watch it again.It can't tell you enough that this was an amazing movie. It was certainly the best of the year. If you're wondering if it's better than The Dark Knight I honestly can't say. Time will tell. It could be better, and that's some of the highest praise I can give it.tkubas1.wordpress.com"
76,"Christopher Nolan did a great job on the two first films. His greatness came to be in combining a complex rich story with even more complex and interesting characters.No doubt that this is an epic movie in a lot of ways. The score, the directing, the visual effects. Everything is done with utmost precision and thought, but, one thing is lacking - Plot and even more important is the Character motives. There is no explanation to why so many people follow Bane (or why goddamn no one shot him down), or why bane himself is so devoted to the concept of the league of shadows. So is Miranda. Nor why exactly cat woman does what she does if it's helping batman or helping Bain. I wouldn't go about complaining about the love story between Batman and Catwoman which simply came to be without any explanations. There are many plot holes: mainly about the nuclear bomb (that came to be known by the bad guys after they kidnapped the nuclear physicist).Well the whole story itself and many scenes were just really CHESSY; like the one that Catwoman fight off one of Bain Henchman so that the poor little kid could have his stolen shiny red apple, the anthem scene and many others. Watching this movie you feel as Nolan didn't have put much effort to write an interesting script.In conclusion, just another breathtaking full of action and special effects summer movie, Nothing more."
77,"Let me start by saying, that I am an avid Nolan admirer. Up until now I haven't seen a bad Nolan film. All of his movies would be in my top movies list if I had one, I consider him a genius. After seeing the final act of his Batman I have started to reconsider.The movie was filled with moments where I found myself thinking ""This is not believable"" and after the first hour I asked myself ""Is this it?"". Gladly after the first hour things did become more meaningful. The ""fall"" of the dark knight was awesome, Bane was a tough guy and the Batman did suffer. It was great. Even Anne Hathaway came trough crushing all my negative preconceptions. Other than that, the movie certainly didn't deliver.In the end they ruined Banes character. Batman's training in this film was far from believable. There were lot of little stories and story structures going on, which didn't work when added together. I mean they worked but comparing to the previous films of Nolan they certainly did not deliver. In many scenes I thought ""This is something that just could not happen"", the things in this film just didn't work. And I don't mean Batman doing his stunts, of course they are unrealistic, I mean all the little things that left me bothered.On the other hand when it comes to Batman's stunts there were little, the end conclusion left me thinking ""was this the great finale of BATMAN?"". Isn't Batman supposed to do something cooler than fly a plane or ride a motorcycle? Isn't Batman supposed to be an acrobat who beats everyone in a cool, cunning and mysterious ways? Here he was the operator of an army plane. In the previous films he was Batman, in this film he doesn't really come off as Batman. His only a random commando wearing a Batman suit. This is something I could not forgive Nolan for.If the scenes we're actually believable I would've propably considered forgiving him this error, but these two errors together are just too much for me to say this is an impressive movie. You might be able to go as far to say this is good, but it is not impressive. This is a shame, because the guy who did this has done nothing but impressive movies. For some other director this movie could be a good stepping stone for something better, an acceptable movie that did have its moments, but for Nolan it is an utter failure. There we're times in this movie when he got me and I was impressed. The movie did in certain scenes raise my emotion and hit me where it should've, but as a whole taking into account all the bad things it cannot be regarded as a movie above others.I was let down with this movie. With all of his previous movies that I have seen in the theathre I have gone in with enormous expectations, like the kind of hyped mind you should never walk in with and every single time I have walked out with my expectations blown away by the grandness of what I have just seen. This time I walked in with the same expectations and came out disappointed. The only question in my mind being ""How was he able to not see these flaws in this movie, I thought he was a genius who could not fail""."
78,"First let me state that I love Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Needless to say that I was ultra-super excited about TDKR release back in 2012. But...after watching it a couple of times I realized that it had a few major plot issues:
1-If Bruce Way was really ""down for the count for 8 years, then how come he had so many physical issues?!2- This one not only bothered everyone, but should've been addressed as a ""special featurette anime"", or something, in the Blue-ray/DVD release!! How on earth did Bruce Wayne returned to Gotham City and got past Bane's blockade?!3-How come Bane was that ""surprised""
when Batman reapers in Gotham, if Miranda Tate (Ra's Al Ghul's daughter) already knew that Bruce Wayne is back in town?!4-Was it really that easy for Robin to figure out BW was Batman? If so, the anyone can!5-The Wall Street scam to take over Wayne's Enterprises' money and leave rice Wayne penny less couldn't have worked. The stock market doesn't work that way!So, I know that Nolan is an extremely talented and accomplished film maker, but someone within his circle should've addressed this script issues. Still, one hell of a comic movie!!"
79,"I'll be brutally honest here. I liked The Dark Knight better than this. Even though its just couple of hours since I finished watching it.Sure, TDK had its flaws, but then, it was such a marvelous noir saga, a treatise in crime drama that left us begging for more at the end. The phrase ""page-turner"" is often applied to engrossing books, but that could work just as well for the magnificent film. To this day, I cannot take my eyes off whenever I see TDK and by the time that ravishing interrogation scene between Batman and Joker is on, nothing is likely to stir me from my seat. By choosing to make the titular character undergo a perception shift, a massive (and ultimately successful) gamble was taken. And who can forget the late, great Heath Ledger's spectacular performance? TDKR is not a bad movie per se. Seen alone, it has the ideal ingredients for a summer blockbuster: an A-list cast, monumental action sequences, modern themes of terrorism and official ineptitude, as well as intricate sub-plots which mesh well together at the end. There is more than a passing reference to the predecessors, especially Batman Begins (which, in my humble opinion, is an enormously underrated flick). And it works to a great extent.Where this film fails as TDK succeeded is in the amount of layering. Some sub-plots were so complex that I was left confused as to where I was before that particular sequence (case in point: Blake's impromptu reconnaissance of a dockyard). Others were left frustratingly hanging in thin air. The plot also seems slow paced at first. While the first sequence is downright awesome, what follows afterward is distinctly underwhelming. Above all else, Batman is renowned to be a master strategist. Here, he ends up getting deceived not once, but twice at Catwoman's hands. You mean to tell me that eight years is good enough to make a superbly trained, marine-worthy, genius escape artist-cum-detective become dull? Really? I won't go ahead and slate Nolan more here, simply because he gave me the privilege of watching two of the best superhero movies ever filmed in Batman Begins and TDK. The glass is always half-full in my eyes, and I'll admit that Hathaway and Gordon-Levitt were both perfect selections for their roles. I'm not too sure of Tom Hardy, since his performance is more physical than metaphorical but given his task was to exude a ruthless menace, he did his job. The rest of the familiar supporting cast are brilliant as before, especially with Caine showing his human side that we always suspected was well alive beneath that stiff British upper lip exterior and dry wit. I read somewhere that this is not a Batman movie, but a Bruce Wayne movie. And I fully agree. Having to reconcile (with unflattering results) with a life without Batman, Bruce is alone even as a social presence and a corporate figure. It is a true challenge but then again, Christian Bale turned in a remarkable performance in both BB and TDK (he held his own in those scenes where Ledger was not present). And in TDKR, he leaves an indelible mark on a role that would probably be the benchmark.Batman Begins was all about ""Fear"" while ""Chaos"" was a running theme in TDK. TDKR does a great job in being a conclusion to the trilogy, but it is not the best one among the three, probably because there is no strong undercurrent of a theme here."
80,"I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and the first 2 Dark Knight movies, so I had high expectations for this movie. The Dark Knight Rises is good, but it is nowhere near the level of the other two movies. It has several things that are a bit cliché and it also had several plot holes that I found very irritating and distracting. My friend who I saw it with initially thought it was the best out of the trilogy, but after we discussed the plot holes that he missed, he ranked it as the worst of the three movies. Throughout the movie I felt like everything was a bit overdone. It seemed like they were trying so hard to make the ""epic conclusion"" that they forgot to make it realistic or reasonable. One of the things I loved about the first two was how it dealt with Batman in a fairly realistic way. There was a fairly good overview of how he functioned and how he was viewed. In this I thought there was much less dealing with the separation of Bruce Wayne and Batman, which was one of the interesting parts of the first 2. Also, I would describe the main character of The Dark Knight Rises as Bruce Wayne rather than Batman, which I found greatly disappointing. Still a good movie, but not nearly as great as the first 2."
81,"As a huge fan of superhero movies and undeniably the batman Christopher Nolan has depicted is the favourite of my choice. He is humane yet enigmatic, heroic and self-giving. Chris Nolan has produced superhero movies into a whole different level. The action, acting, sound and other visual effects was absolutely mind-blowing for the previous two productions. He is good at picking the right cast playing the right role like Michael Caine, Gary Oldham and Morgan Freeman who have always been the linchpin behind the success of the movie. I am also in awe of his previous works excluding the batman series such as Momento and The Prestige. So I had high hope and expectation on the Dark Knight Rises of how the director can build up the finale of the Batman trilogy which the world has long anticipated this blockbuster.Judged by the content of the trailers, lots of people might expect it to be an action intensive film with lots of explosive elements and the elemental conflict between good and evil. If I'm honest, I have already seen most of the action scenes of the movie via the trailers before watching the film which is a saddening thing to hear from an audience's point of view. The entire film was almost three hours long and there were way too much chit chatting with the whole conspiracy by the villain but not getting down into the main point or the action bits. I think those scenes about having trials on the people by the judge whether they were guilty or not was plainly farcical in my opinion and quite cheesy which I never experienced in the previous two batman films.The Dark Knight Rises has put in a lot of new characters who played a key role in the film including Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing John Blake and Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate. But the main villain, Bane played by Tom Hardy made me anticipated on how he can use his eyes as his weapon to proceed the acting, to show his wrath towards the corrupted society. I must say I was a bit disappointed at the villain role as the joker simply played too well in The Dark Knight in which Tom Hardy could not exceed the expectation. With those prestigious casts which all of them are great actors, I expected that it would be a sensational experience crafted by those actors. However, the entire film always talking about bits and bobs and never really get to one main theme. The experience was messy and too stuffed in without much focus to cause the audience to fall into the frictional world that Christopher Nolan was trying to present.In conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises does not exceed my expectation nor better than the predecessor. I thought it was a let down the way how Christopher Nolan wrap up this impeccable Batman series. I only gave the rating 7/10 because of the two fantastic previous productions he made."
82,"as much as i am huge fan of the batman in almost every facet of the genre, i am having a hard time getting completely behind this film. it makes the same mistake a lot of sequels do: it tries to pack too much into the story. the reason why the first two films in the trilogy, batman begins and the dark knight, worked so well was because they mostly focused on one central story and villain. in the dark knight rises there are too many new characters and too many story lines to be introduced and told that the film loses focus. sure it has plenty of action which you would expect but nolan strays too far from the source material when it comes to the characters in the film. the cast does a fine job with the script they had to work with and most film goers will probably like this film but i think true fans of the batman who know the history of the characters will wonder what nolan is doing to their batman."
83,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a mainstream accomplishment, a skillfully crafted, ambitious superhero movie that adds more dimension to the superhero genre. Here is the epic (2 and 3/4 hours!) conclusion to a most beloved trilogy that forever changed the genre that it was type-casted in.I really have to admire Christian Bale's dedication to the role. At times he is weak, lacking confidence, and shrouded in gloom. At other times (in later scenes involving a prison) his eyes show the painful return to his self-determination and perseverance. Yes his Batman no doubt is still the best interpretation of the character, but here he is more human, less growly and more prone to weakness than ever before. Here, we first see Bruce Wayne as a single, rich hermit with a limp in one leg, aided only by his loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine in his most emotional performance of the trilogy). Caine may get a supporting actor nomination for this movie.It's been eight years since he took the rep for Harvey Dent's crimes - but Wayne/Batman soon faces a new threat - the towering, ominous terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy in a remarkably gripping performance and an empowering presence) who threatens to destroy Gotham city. Hardy is ruthlessly terrific as Bane, true to the spirit of the comics, as he manages to instill fear in all of Gotham. It would be unfair to compare him to Heath Ledger's pitch perfect portrayal of the Joker, but these are two completely different characters. Whereas the Joker aims for a battle of psychological wits between Batman, Bane aspires just to destroy Bruce Wayne and Gotham.There is a pervasive sense of haunting dread and gloom throughout the movie, especially throughout the first 2 hours and scenes with Bane, this is achieved not just by Nolan's writing/directing but also to cinematographer Wally Pfister who shoots the film in a gloomy hue throughout, and composer Hans Zimmer's great, dark orchestral score. Zimmer probably has outdone himself in the trilogy so far, especially with Bane's ominous one-chord theme.But the last 30 minutes contains nothing but great, sometimes spectacular action sequences and stunts which segues in with the story (a rarity) and which all leads to an emotionally satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The stunts are so well done, they clearly show they were all done using practical effects instead of CGI (with the probable exception of the stadium scene and scenes involving ""the Bat"" and the ""Bat-cycle""... which still look great). Lee Smith's crisp editing and Pfister's cinematography cuts the action at a perfect clip while making the somber moments absorbing.Two love interests are introduced - Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway, looking mesmerizingly beautiful while giving a devilishly cunning performance), a specialized thief/con-woman who is not what she seems, and Miranda Tate (Marion Cottilard) who provides a more gentler shade for the lonely, love-lorn Bruce to rely on, or does he? Young cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) serves as a somewhat younger shadow of Bruce, and he also shows the same selfless courage at the climax of the movie where he tries to save some kids from an orphanage. Scenes involving Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) are not particularly notable, but at the very least every one of these characters are still very active in the film's climax.Its the screen writing which suffers slightly. While clearly ambitious and detailed, the screenplay lacks some depth from which the previous film succeeded, and seems to return to the roots of ""Batman Begins"", focusing more on comic book origins - combining with the sombre, ultra- realistic tone of ""The Dark Knight"". For the most part, it gels nicely. There's also some nice character development for Bruce and Alfred, where they're relationship gets strained to the fullest. Some twists at the end that would arouse comic-book fans too. However, Bane's full character should have been expanded upon - yes, even though the film is nearly 3 hours long, it's not really long enough. Bane's and Selina's characters lack in development and they come across as near-two dimensional. It's clear Nolan bit off a bit more than he can chew here, since he was trying his best to outdo his previous effort. No faulting the actors though.For all of its screen writing flaws though, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a mainstream triumph, putting new levels of fear and dread in a superhero movie not seen before its own predecessor. Nolan's vision for the character shines through completely and makes this trilogy rightfully stand out as ""The Godfather"" of superhero films. This entry may not be as brilliant as its predecessor, but it is still nevertheless great, sort of excellent really, and hats off to Nolan, Bale, Hardy and the rest of the cast and crew, past and present, for delivering the truest interpretation of the Batman character that has never been, and very likely in the future, never will be seen again. Kudos to you, Christopher Nolan.Overall rating: 86%P.S.: My review for ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) four years ago is basically a teenage me kissing the behind of the film, with me calling it a masterpiece and editing the review on IMDb so much until they won't allow me to edit/review it anymore. Looking back, I probably shouldn't have been so enthusiastic and made myself look like a rabid fanboy; it isn't a masterpiece, but nonetheless still an excellent film and the pinnacle of the superhero film genre.EDIT: My sincere condolences to the victims and their family and friends of the Aurora shooting tragedy. This was a real random, cruel and senseless act of violence."
84,"The Dark Knight Rises and Falls. I cannot put it in more simpler words than that.I went in there with my coffers full of hope of having my mind blown out. After all it was Christopher Nolan and I am yet to see a work of his which has under-delivered.But I guess everything has a first time.Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie, not just a great one, and it left me highly confused as to how I should feel about it. TDKR, more than anything, falls under its own weight. With the endless hype and as a follow up to one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, TDKR had a lot riding on its shoulders. Tasked with this,Christopher Nolan has to be lauded for what he has achieved, or should I rather say 'hoped to'?Let's begin with the basics. The Dark Knight trilogy was not a trilogy to begin with. Batman Begins (BB) and The Dark Knight (TDK) are almost two independent Batman films with little in common in terms of a story arc other than the characters it carries forward. That given, TDKR's greatest flaw was in attempting to connect the first movie to his final one so as to make it feel like one continuous arc. (Think kind of what happened in the final season of LOST) While I understand Nolan's intentions, the forced continuity just killed it.This was further amplified by the many plot holes that marred the story. To keep this review spoiler free I will not mention any of them here but it will suffice to say that if you are a fan of the series but are willing to look past your fanboy goggles, the failings are plain to see. Tom Hardy's take on the superstrong Bane was interesting enough to start off with, but as it went on there were just too many similarities with a previous villain (I will not say which one) to actually stand out on his own. Even his motives and methods were too familiar to be regarded as novel. His fights with Batman were epic enough though, and you almost pity Batman for having to face the mini-hulk that Hardy had transformed himself into. His menacing voice coupled with the cold hard stare in his eyes gave him the aura of a truly awful foe, one that must not be triffled with. But add to that some cringe worthy dialogues, forgetful action sequences and appalling acting by Marion Cotillard, and I find myself subtracting more from the movie than adding. Nolan needed to make this movie bigger and better than the previous two, and for that he needed a crisis large enough to destroy Batman's world. While he did manage to conjur up a scheme, its immensity and implausibility made it hard to believe. I really wanted to love this movie but far too often found myself shaking my head in dismay as things got grander and larger, until they no more fit into the world. But while I might seem to be cursing the movie a lot, remember I did say it is a good movie. And the best thing for me in the movie was - wait for it - Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle.I will confess that when I had first heard the casting I was more than dismayed. But now I'm forced to eat my own words. Anne Hathaway was brilliant. She might not be your regular comic book version of Selina Kyle, but in Nolan's Dark Knight universe she was the perfect choice to portray Gotham's sexiest vigilante. Everything from her stance to her fight moves and to the way she spouted sassy dialogues was perfect. Given more time and space, I am sure she could have probably stolen the show. That however would have been unfair to Christian Bale/Bruce Wayne/Batman. The man has been a constant shining light throughout the series. He is a perfect fit for the role and has carried both versions of his character almost flawlessly. Moving into his third (and final) film in the series, I am glad to say he has not faltered a bit. While BB was about Batman, and TDK about the Joker, this movie was about Bruce Wayne the man behind the mask. As a superhero who is a mere mortal compared to most others out there, TDKR's focus on Bruce Wayne's mortality was totally warranted. This was not a Batman movie. This was a Bruce Wayne movie, with his alter ego guest starring. TDKR plays out like the swansong it is to this great character Bale and Nolan have moulded over the years.Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are as dependable as usual. They provided stellar performances as always. Even the newcomer to series - Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave a fine performance as the hotheaded cop John Blake. His character was by far one of the most interesting in the movie, developing into interesting dimensions, but alas finally being let down partly by the story and mostly by the limited run time that a movie of this scope can afford to a new character.All in all, TDKR is a fine movie, but sadly nothing more. While I thoroughly enjoyed the ending (the last 5-10 minutes) and a bunch of scenes here and there, the action sequenced seemed bland, and the motives for some of the main characters left a lot to be desired. Batman was great as usual, but Bruce Wayne was better. And given the track-record of threequels, TDKR is a comparatively great ending to a great series, even if it is not all that it could have been. Probably the weakest entry to the series but nonetheless a wholesome entertainer on its own merits. Just don't expect to be blown away."
85,"I decided to write a re-review of The Dark Knight Rises because after seeing it a third time, you lose the hype, you lost the excitement because that is all done with. You can really focus on the movie, and I felt like I was never able to do that with the first review I wrote. I would probably have to say this is at least my second favorite Batman movie-- after Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight following closely at number three. You never realize the first go around, while TDKR is drastically different than BB & TDK in terms of it's style, it's that style that sets it apart from any of the previous entries.You get subtle hints to the grand picture of it all through tidbits throughout TDKR. A lot of people have different beliefs, whether or not Alfred was imagining Bruce near the end of the movie, but I believe it was a real vision. Bruce was finally happy, and left his old life behind. I also believe it is real because Alfred never was aware of Bruce and Selina growing fond for each other towards the end of the movie, and she was sitting next to Bruce at the diner. Bruce Wayne is ""dead"" but not the Batman. It is emotionally satisfying because now you see Bruce a character you cared for, finally have a life worth living. He's at peace.I ultimately believe Blake becomes Batman, for one the Bat signal is repaired. Bruce gives him the coordinates to the Batcave. And for all you Batman fanatics, remember in Batman Begins, Bruce told Alfred after being gone for seven years, ""As a man I can be destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be everlasting. I could be incorruptible"", or something a long those lines, and I look at that and tie it in with John Blake's character of indeed becoming Batman.Some of those points I mentioned is what makes TDKR such a joy to watch. So thoughtful, and emotionally engaging. Nolan definitely did give justice to the franchise. When I first seen it I felt like it was the least favorite of mine but still enjoyable-- but now I'd have to say it is my second favorite out of all the three, maybe even my favorite one in the trilogy!9.0/10"
86,"Ultimately, this is an excellent film, but after seeing this as part of an all night trilogy viewing, I have to say it is not as good as The Dark Knight.The film opens with, strangely for Nolan a quite farcical scene that introduces Bane. I won't spoil it, but please tell me, who takes 3 unknown prisoners on a plane without even looking at their faces? Really??The proper story starts, and to chose words like jaded, withdrawn, cynical, tired, lethargic and disconnected, is how we find our hero and Police commissioner. So ultimately this is how the audience is manipulated into feeling too, and so act 1 is ultimately a long ""downer"" as lots of elements are put in place for the last 2 acts. But, after sitting through six hours of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I was left feeling it was too much, and I started getting bored with the overall emotional shade of the film, coupled with the lack of action and the lack of any real story. It was like watching a plate spinner getting 40 plates spinning on pointy poles, necessary for his act, but ultimately boring for his audience.The second Act is where our bad guy makes his play and gains the upper hand. One of the strongest sources of praise for The Dark Knight, is the ultimately real-world story telling. But what Bane unleashes on Gotham, takes us back to the more comic book villainy of the first film, which I won't criticise, but for me is not as rewarding as the realism of the second film. All the while our good guys are slow, wrong footed, and creaking under their mental baggage, so we are two thirds through a superhero film, where our superhero has been anything but. Action has been thin on the ground, and we have all been through the ringer, and we are crying for some redeeming pay-off.After the third act, our her is restored, all has been put right. However, ultimately our pay-off for all we have been put through in the first two acts is only satisfying if you can shrug off the memory of what you have just been put through. It's much like childbirth, you need your brain to be swimming with endorphins to blank out the pain of labour, and for me, I didn't get enough endorphins to make the experience totally rewarding.Add to this, a slightly facial bad-guy twist, and a groan-worthy sequel shoe-in, I have to say that Nolan has tried to squeeze in far too much, and Batman's saga creeps over the line, rather than ending with a bang, so much so, you will feel convinced that this is not the final part of the story, and we will need another installment to accept that our hero has sailed off into the sunset."
87,"Before I get down-voted because I'm not giving 'The Dark Knight Rises' a 10 (the trend most of the users on her seem to be following), I'll list the numbers of things I really enjoyed about the film, and there were plenty.-The cast Nolan's able to put together to end his trilogy is really something to marvel at. From the veterans of the series (Bale, Freeman, Caine, Oldman) to the new faces (Gordon-Levitt, Cotillard, Hathway, Hardy) each bring their all to their characters, even if a few are somewhat undeveloped (more on that later).-Action scenes. 'Batman Begins,' while I admire it for it's first look at the gritty take to the comic formula, had some incredible poor and incomprehensible fight scenes, where it was unclear how who punching what or what was happening. In 'The Dark Knight,' the scenes were much more clear, a big improvement. Here, the fighting scenes are at their best. When Baine and Batman throw down, it's some of the most intense fight scenes I've seen in a long time.-Huge setpieces. I could say that about all of these movies, but in this film especially. Gotham City is beautifully recognized. It's always great to see a huge place like this down naturally, never been plagued by artificial CGI (Nolan uses as little as possible.) Not to mention the number of extras, which number in the thousands.-The ending. Even if it jumps the shark, the ending to Nolan's epic trilogy is overall fulfilling. Fans of the series won't be disappointed, even if the casual might Not that that's out of the way, the problems I had with the film. . .-Bane's voice. When we first meet Bane, on a plane, his voice was nearly unbearable. It sounded like something a ten-year-old would do when playing with audio effects on his computer. The dialogue didn't help, as he spewed out clunky one-liners. Here was Bane, with his terrifying appearance,sounding like a cartoon. It did improve over the ocurse of the movie, but the first introduction to the character was something I almost couldn't shake off.-Too many character introductions. Maybe this is a criticism of the whole trilogy, but I'll have to put the blame on this one. Too many characters are brought in, with their developments feeling rushed. It almost appears like Nolan adds these new additions to the script at the last minute.For the most part, the good outweighs the bad. It's a very entertaining film and, as far as summer blockbusters, it's definitely worth the price of admission.7/10"
88,"I feel The Dark Knight Rises is the best of Nolan's Trilogy in overall entertainment. The hallmark of this series is its dark, gritty realism, at least as realistic as you can get for a superhero movie. I prefer this approach to the semi-goofy style of the 1989-97 series.Bane's a formidable villain and Anne Hatheway surprisingly plays a good ""Catwoman"" (I say ""surprisingly"" only because I thought she has too innocent/sweet of a quality to pull off the role). Also on hand is Marion Cotillard, who's stunning as Miranda Tate, and Joseph Gordon-Levite, who's effective as police officer Blake. Beyond these we get the principal characters/cast of the first two films, minus the Joker and Harvey Dent.My only beef with this series is that the plots are convoluted and there's an overload of characters, which means you really have to pay attention or you'll get lost in the process. This is never a problem when a story is ultra-compelling, but none of these films are, although ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is definitely the most compelling of the three. This factor is what keeps this series from being great in my opinion.But don't take that the wrong way; I'm just being honest. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a quality Batman film.The film runs 165 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh (Gotham City), England, Scotland, India, Italy, New York, Newark and California.GRADE: B+"
89,"So let me start out with the negatives. This film was the least great of the three in my opinion. It had some major plot holes and confusion at the ending. But that's also something that made it great, because it is an ending that could be interpreted in different ways. So in one way, it could not be seen as a major plot hole although it has in my book. Anywho, the main antagonist Bane is one of my favorites. Find out in the film to see why, because it sure took me by a bit of surprise. On the other hand, some other appearances were quite obvious to be, but still enjoyable nonetheless. In general Christopher Nolan has made an epic trilogy that surely will stay a classic over the years to follow."
90,This film has the misfortune to be a sequel to one of the greatest films of all time. The Dark Knight is no easy act to follow. However Nolan does an amazing job of adding spectacle to make the final installment of the trilogy memorable. The realism has always made this series stand above the rest. Are there some plot holes? Yes. Do they make it a bad film? No. Go watch Justice League then honestly tell me TDKR is bad. It's not. It is simply over shadowed by its predecessor.
91,"Christopher Nolan concludes his epic vision of the Batman franchise in high style, as Christian Bale returns as the caped crusader, after masked henchman Bane threatens to destroy Gotham. This stuff is candy for superhero aficionados, and Nolan manages to balance a large cast without shortchanging anyone. Drawn from his slumber by mysterious cat burglar Selina Kyle, the Batman faces what may be his biggest and most dangerous test yet as Bane wields a nuclear explosive and threatens to detonate. Secrets from the past are revealed, and loose ends tied. Tremendous support from Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mariana Cotilliard, and others. This is a film to make you stand up and cheer. Fun comic fable, perhaps not up to the standard of the prior classic, but does amazing things with it's large budget and well worth viewing."
92,"The Dark Knight Rises is a great film and should definitely be watched. This review will have a bunch of critiques in it because... what's the point of reading a review that just compliments a movie non-stop. So remember, I really enjoyed the Dark Knight Rises... but it did have a bunch of annoying factors to it that did take away from the experience overall. I will list my issues with the movie first, then I will say what I enjoyed about the film at the end so that the review will end on a pleasant note.Something that really bothered me about this movie is that it was inconsistent at times. For example, the power of Batman's bat-copter. In one scene its rockets are extremely powerful and can easily blow up multiple cars in a single shot, but in the next scene it can't even scratch an armored truck with multiple rounds... or even burst its tires. This movie is full of small stuff like that which really bothers me. The other movies were all about making Batman... realistic and more logical. But in this movie it seems like everyone is making stupid decisions, wrong choices, and there seems to be a lack of anyone making intelligent moves except for the main villain. Though I will mention that Commissioner Gordon and his detective side-kick break that formula which was nice. First off (and this goes with all of the Batman movies): why are the cops portrayed as cliché jerks who don't really know how to fight? This movie really portrays cops badly and that they are useless. In the movie there is an army of cops with armed guns, running against an army of thugs with machine guns, snipers, and rockets. So what do the cops do? They run out into the open in a large swarm... and use hand to hand combat... they don't use their guns to fight the hundreds of guys with machine guns and tanks... it makes no sense. The military in this movie seems to work similarly to the cops but even worse. In case you don't know, *spoilers* this movie revolves around Bane and a nuclear bomb threat. Basically he has a fusion reactor that is portable and is threatening Gotham with it. The thing that bothers me is that the military does absolutely nothing about it. While Bane does say that if anyone enters Gotham that he will set it off, there still would've been ways to take out Bane. It bothers me that the military does absolutely nothing at all to try and stop Bane. But I guess this movie isn't about the military.A small problem I mentioned earlier and I will mention again is that no one except the enemies use their guns... at all. The enemies are threatening Gotham with a nuke, are killing hundreds (if not thousands) of innocent people, and armed with machine guns and even declare they are in open war... but no one ever really uses any guns (effectively) against them. Which leads me up to Bane... Bane is really menacing and well portrayed. But people seem to forget that (like the joker) a single bullet can still kill him. The second you realize that guns actually could've stopped this entire situation... the entire plot starts to fall apart... now I'm started to sounds like I work for the NRA hahahaha so I'll stop.Minor issues: No bat-mobile... at all, Bane doesn't have a dramatic death, all guys fall for women they've met two seconds ago, if you could stop the fusion core from going off by flooding it (which is stated in the movie) then why did it go off at the end? Another question, why didn't Morgan Freeman just flood the room with the reactor which would've killed all of the bad guys and would've disabled the nuke. That would've saved so many lives and the movie would've been a good hour shorter.Now that I'm done listing the minor faults of the movie, here are the good stuff! First off, the movie has a lot of nice standard special effects. Standard special effects always look nicer and keep movies from aging. Though the CGI in this movie... it already looks aged. Bane is a good menace in this movie and is very well acted. He looks very powerful and intimidating in appearance, but the movie didn't put much emphasis on the fact that his mask is what makes him powerful. The movie never really says that his mask is the key to his power but oh well. The acting is really good in this movie and it seems slightly odd that pretty much everyone is a little bit more interesting than Bruce Wayne. I'm not saying that Christian Bale didn't do a great job of acting, but all of the other characters were a bit more intriguing in my opinion.The plot is pretty good, there are a few plot holes here and there but that's not too important. I guess I was kind of curious why every single person that is in jail seems to be evil and a murderer. I find it odd that it seems like all of the gang lords and murderers want Gotham to be in chaos because most people don't actually want chaos.The ending was good, but it begs for a sequel sooooooo much! Which is kind of annoying since there won't be a sequel. But at least it ended on a good note that was actually happy. Good movie! Not perfect, but still good!"
93,"""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) is the third and final film in Christopher Nolan's trilogy about the comic book superhero Batman, created in 1939 by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. The franchise, starting in 2005 with ""Batman Begins"" and continuing in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is brought to a conclusion, and traditional Hollywood thinking is used by the Warner Bros. Studio here: everything is bigger, louder and more explosive and with higher stakes than before. Yet this expansionism hasn't translated into greater quality; if anything, it is the most flawed of the trio. Continuity errors, plot holes and logic defying events plague the film incessantly. The screenplay, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, feels like it is two or three drafts away from being a finished product. Geopolitical significance is constantly strived for, especially in the latter part of the film, yet it fails to fully grasp its own half-articulated ideas and ends feeling like the pat, smug ""safe"" hawkish ideologies of a studio executive more interested in profit margins than ideas. All these mistakes are a repetition of the previous entry in the series; in many ways this perfectly encapsulates Hollywood: nothing forgotten, nothing learnt.Still, Nolan's direction is as impressive as ever, really delivering in the large scale set pieces that dot the picture. He brings a real energy to the screen that almost papers over the cracks in the story. The dynamic action scenes are hardly original though and the opening sequence is straight out of a James Bond movie.The acting is generally of a high standard, with Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy all very good. Unfortunately, the Oscar winning Marion Cotillard is given nothing to do and struggles to create a performance out of a poorly written character.The cinematography by Academy Award winner Wally Pfister is good and a cut above the usual standard found in the average superhero blockbuster, the same of which can be said for the editing by Lee Smith and the booming music score of Hans Zimmer.If then this climax to the Batman series is a disappointment, torpedoed by a below par script, then at least Christopher Nolan directs so well that you will be immersed in the film to the point where perhaps you will be more forgiving of its flaws and be swept along by this enjoyable spectacle."
94,"I went to see the Dark Knight Rises last week and I have to say I was impressed. Story-wise it's a lot better than it's predecessors. The plot is coherent and has several interesting twists along the way that I won't spoil for you here. My only complaint is that it is a bit heavy going at some points. 3 hours is a long time, and I wouldn't go so far as to say boring, but it definitely takes a while to pick up the pace. However once it does you are in for a thrill ride.Nolan did a fantastic job with the Characters, from the troubled Bruce Wayne/Batman to Catwoman to the antagonist Bane, as well as secondary characters such as Alfred and Gordon, they are all fleshed out beautifully and are very believable in respect to the source material. Supplemented by superb acting by the all star cast, I have no complaints here.The direction is fantastic. As I said above, it takes a while to pick up, but it never ever get's boring. As soon as you start to think that, something happens that pulls you right back in. Nolan deserves to be commended for this. The action scenes are brilliantly done, the special effects are great, Hans Zimmer's score is, as always, superb, the editing and cinematography are crisp. There really is not much to complain about here. In my personal opinion it is the best installment in the Nolan trilogy, and if you haven't seen it yet I can only recommend you do so as soon as possible."
95,"Didn't think this film lived up to the hype surrounding it. It was good, don't get me wrong but it didn't compare with the Dark Knight. Seemed too full of action and definitely violence, which obscured the story somewhat.However Christian Bale played a blinder again and he has definitely made the role his and his alone. Nobody would be able to compare to him. The ending was again a bit rushed and didn't really come as any surprise, and again this let down the overall film. Sets up another series, which would have to be exceptional to compare. But overall a let down and not a fitting end to this franchise. Let's hope the Man Of Steel (another DC offering) will strengthen the comic lines takings as the Green Lantern certainly didn't. Sorry, the Avengers will be the box office topper this year!"
96,"'The Dark Knight Rises' isn't Epic. But its impressive nonetheless. Christopher Nolan delivers a film worth watching, however, he doesn't quiet top himself in here. Its an entertainer! 'The Dark Knight Rises' Synopsis: Eight years on, a new terrorist leader, Bane, overwhelms Gotham's finest, and the Dark Knight resurfaces to protect a city that has branded him an enemy.'The Dark Knight Rises' is overtly long & dragging. Christopher Nolan & Jonathan Nolan's Screenplay is excellent in parts, but at times, it comes across as dragging & long. For example, the bad-guy, Bane, played by Tom Hardy, why does he hate Gotham so much & why he's being so god-damn heartless. There is proper reason, yet he's creating a chaos. Another flaw, lies in its running time. 168 minutes seems a bit too stretched. Christopher Nolan's Direction is extremely competent. Cinematography is grand. Editing & Art Design, are spectacular. Action-Sequences are huge. Performance-Wise: Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, shines. The Oscar-Winning Actor is so believable & natural in his part. Tom Hardy as Bane, is a big letdown. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is quite good. Michael Caine as Alfred, is given the backseat, while Gary Oldman as James Gordon & New-Entry Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, are terrific. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate, has a delicious role. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, is dignified. On the whole, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an impressive superhero flick, but it isn't half as good as its predecessor 'The Dark Knight'."
97,"Nolan's films seem to have fans mainly among boys/young men. I have seen many of his films and never found them really satisfying. Emotionally, I have never felt a connection with his movies. They're OK, but they do not stay with me. I found Batman Begins tepid, I found TDK exciting only because of Heath Ledger but I thought the trailer for the movie was better than the actual movie, so I was not really excited to see TDKR.Having seen it, I have to say I think this was the most enjoyable one of the trilogy and I think one of the reasons is because there were finally some female characters worth something.I am not a fan of Anne Hathaway but she worked here. Catwoman had the best one liners and she was the highlight of the movie as far as I was concerned. Not being a fan of Batman comics, I was surprised that Miranda was revealed to be the mastermind and happy to see a woman in the ultimate villain role although her reasoning was nutty.I do not find Christian Bale to be attractive but for some reason, that last scene where Alfred sees him alive and well was hot as hell. Not sure why I found it so. Bruce Wayne being brought to his knees and being humbled, losing his wealth (but obviously he had something stashed away as any smart person would), but becoming free at the end by losing his identity and all the baggage that went with it, it was hopeful at the end, and perhaps it was seeing him a bit carefree that was very sexy.Interestingly, while Bane broke the Batman physically, Bane made Bruce Wayne whole emotionally/spiritually by the end. The person that truly broke the Batman was the Joker because we saw what happened to him after he put the Joker away. The Joker said ""you complete me"" to Batman and clearly that was also true for the Batman until the end scene where we see Bruce Wayne in sunlight.I do not think the Nolans can ever really write good female characters, their movies are so male centered and male POV, but TDKR was their best effort to date and finally, one of Nolan's movies struck at least tangentially, an emotional chord, albeit fleetingly and lightly."
98,"I did not like how this was the most sentimental of the three Nolan Batman-movies. I prefer when the emotional aspects are more subtle, letting the audience draw its own conclusions about the characters feeling given their circumstances and back-stories. In The Dark Knight I felt the director trusted his audience more to understand Wayne's reactions after having heavily emphasized his childhood in Batman Begins. Whereas in The Dark Knight Rises it was much dwelled upon and fed to us with sentimental music. This made the first part of the movie a bit dreary, but it quickly became more enthralling and kept getting better as the story progressed. The acting was impeccable as were the visuals. I admit to having prejudices against superhero-movies, but the characters are complex and interesting. So was the plot, though it is clearly made to appeal to a mass-audience. There is nothing wrong with being popular and I did not waste my time watching these three movies."
99,"The Dark Knight Rises Review 3/5The expectations were high for this film given that it was a direct follow up to The Dark Knight. With a great storyline, memorable characters, groundbreaking action scenes and a perfect performance by Heath Ledger it was easily one of the best comic book adaptations to date. But even that film had its flaws but not as much as this one. At the time of its release a lot of the critics received backlash and even death threats from the rabid fans. The fans were even worse than the Star Wars fans. Anyway The Dark Knight Rises is far from perfect but it does have some enjoyable moments throughout. Eight years have past since the events of The Dark Knight. Bruce Wayne is retired living his life in isolation, The Joker is locked away and Gotham City's crime rate is at an all time low. But the masked villainous Bane and his army are lurking in the sewers and he has a plan. After hearing about Commissioner Gordon being hospitalised and encountering a mysterious cat burglar Bruce Wayne decides to come back out of retirement. It's a real crowd pleaser when he comes back as Batman but he has to go toe to toe with his toughest opponent yet. He's not as fast as he used to be however that is what gives the film it's edge, we can finally root for Bruce Wayne because he is in a vulnerable state here. Bane is sort of like a 60s Bond villain taking the city hostage threatening to blow it up if anyone leaves. The opening plane hijack sequence is breathtaking and like the majority of the action sequences it was shot in IMAX using practical effects. From miniatures to daring stunts we see real stuntmen hang off of the dangling plane fuselage. The overall action scenes are intense accompanied by an epic music score by returning composer Hans Zimmer. Although some of them suffer from bad editing they are still enjoyable and look spectacular. It's best to watch it with surround sound speakers as the sound effects make the experience more immersive from Banes heavy breathing, the bone crunching punch ups to the extremely loud gunshots and explosions. It's the most action packed of the trilogy but it suffers from a thin plot. Christopher Nolan does a fine job directing the film but not much can be said about his screenplay. Unfortunately it's his worst writing yet making this the most implausible chapter. It's full of so many character storylines and it just gets confusing. There are a lot of things that make little to no sense. There isn't much logic to many of the scenes, there are some obvious twists throughout and a lot of things go by unexplained. Using flashbacks it harps back to previous plot lines and characters in an attempt to make it feel more connected to those films. On top of all that it runs at nearly 3 hours which is just too long considering how half baked the plot is. Aside from all of this Christian Bale gives his best performance as a more weary broken Bruce Wayne. Tom Hardy is really good in the role of Bane and every time he's on screen he is physically imposing, very intimidating and he has some great lines of dialogue. Michael Caine is only in it briefly but he gives an emotional nuanced performance as family butler Alfred. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Anne Hathaway both do serviceable jobs - However with such a big cast the film didn't really need them, they are just there for fan service and to be honest their story arcs are not very interesting. But that being said Hathaways cat suit has a cool realistic look to it which fits well within the continuity of the Nolan franchise. That's one thing you can give them credit for is they make these films as grounded in reality as possible. But with outlandish characters like Bane and Catwoman there are a lot of things they have to compromise like Selina Kyle/Catwomans backstory. She wasn't resurrected by cats like the comics, she is simply just a woman who is very good at sneaking about. Bane isn't a raging hulk who gets pumped on steroid juice he's just a conflicted man who has been through some bad stuff. Overall it's a thourouly enjoyable film but it's let down by lazy writing full and plot-holes."
100,"I came out with slight disappointment after watching DKR for I had huge expectations from Nolan after an exceptional TDK.I am huge fan of first two installment of Batman Trilogy. I liked DKR, it's a good movie, but it could have been much better.So rather than discussing its merit, which are many, I am pointing out its shortcomings.It's the weaker than other movies of trilogy and simple reason being it lacks strong characters. DKR is all about storytelling, just like Nolan's Inception, but not as efficient. And in doing so, it fails where Batman Begins and The Dark Knight had succeeded.Batman Begins was all about fear, doubt, self-realization and redemption where Bruce Wayne discovers his destiny as Batman. BB had a story arc which set background for main characters - Batman / Wayne, Ra's al Ghul, Gordon (to some extent) and most importantly Gothom City and hence set stage for a fitting climax.The Dark Knight explores the theme of chaos, morality and belief effortlessly and establishes characters of Joker, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Rachel etc. So effortlessly that people choose to ignore even some major plot holes. Heath Ledger's interpretation of Joker was so mesmerizing that it single handily carried TDK to path of greatness/ critical acclaim.But Dark Knight Rises is all about story telling - efficient but not exceptional. Bane, Miranda Tate, John Blake, Peter Folly (Deputy Commissioner), Selina Kyle - characters are introduced but never explored/ expanded - they just start working on their part - just like cogs in the wheel. They are not so much part of the story itself but just the agents which move the story forward.Bane's character is dull and single dimensional and do not evoke any fear or awe. He's meticulous, intelligent and strong and this is established quickly in movie but after that he slumps into a just another movie villain. Taila / Miranda character is never fully explored. Even Wayne/Batman is devoid of any emotions in this one and he feels so sure of himself that I start wondering if it's the same Batman that I saw in first two installments. Only new character which had some shades was that of Selina Kyle and Anne Hathaway did justice to it. Add to that helplessness of Alfred portrayed superbly by Caine. Other actors are good but there's not much for them to do.There's no dilemma, choices, moral battles, hope, chaos or fear - things that make characters and plot interesting and which made Batman Begins and The Dark Knight really good movies. Even the theme of ""Occupy WallStreet"" is very weak and, at best, is closer to London riots with its looting and arson. There's even perfect order in Bane's revolution. Movie moves effortlessly from one plot to another and to climax that it become at times predictable.But maybe Dark Knight Rises was supposed to be like that only and Nolan had too much to deal with in 2.5 hours. And maybe that's the main problem with DKR - too much is going on in the story that it seems crammed at times. And when there are too many characters and so many story arcs, it's tough to do justice to characters and story telling at the same time.Dark Knight Rises have a good story but lacks strong characters and relies on Inception's style which incidentally differs from style of first two installments of Batman Trilogy.And for me, soul of Nolan's Batman Series is its strong characters, their underlying emotions and a theme which is much deeper and meaningful than all fight, gadgetry and style. And this is where DKR fails.6/10."
101,"Well, I had the highest hopes when I headed to the cinema. I loved, I really loved The Dark Knight, thought it was the best hero/comics movie ever made. So you can imagine I would like to see something that at least compares with that. Boy was I wrong... my disbelief was growing as the movie passed on.So, I'm not telling you the story, you can see it on every other post. I will tell what did not make sense on the movie:the entrance scene, although visually stunning, makes absolutely no sense. - officer Blake has a pointless role, that should have been done by Gordon. - The script is full of holes and inconsistencies like shifting from day to night in minutes or motives for the villains... - the prison is ridiculous. - the plot itself is not very fresh - a bomb with a timer.. common. - Bane's fights were so badly acted, and the villain's deaths just stupid. - Batman itself hardly appears. - The music, from the great Hans Zimmer, actually got annoying on this movie, it was overly used, no time to breath.What I liked about it: - visually still very very good; - Michael Caine amazing as ever; - Anne Hathaway was actually very good for her part; - the stock market scene was well done, and I liked the trials; - the ending after the climax, was pretty good.In conclusion, Nolan failed on the script on which he actually tends to be very good. It seemed sloppy, and sometimes the characters were doing stuff with no point what so ever. The story itself is predictable and the only twist that was put there, actually did worse the better to the movie.I would have given 7.6 to Batman Begins, 9.1 to The Dark Knight and this one a 6.2 at most. It actually ruined a bit the trilogy that was very good.Hope Nolan gets back on his feet and writes like his other movies, because this is surely not the way to go. I also cannot believe how this movie is rated as 8.9. People expect too little these days."
102,"This film is certainly worth the price of a ticket, and I highly respect Nolan for wanting to shoot it on film. It generally looks very good. It's also loaded with ""big scenes"" for all sorts of secondary characters, and it was certainly a nice surprise to have Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy return. But what it comes down to is nearly three hours of pulse-pounding music, slugging, maiming, explosions, and the obligatory ""funny"" one-liners that come after brutal violence. It is indeed a brutal mess. Bane, super villain #3 in the trilogy, is like something out of those Mad Max movies, via television wrestling. The cultivated voice is a hoot, given his barbaric character. This all comes out of the old James Bond movies, and before that the criminal masterminds of countless pulp books and comics. But what does he offer that's new, except a seemingly supernatural ability to do whatever he wants and not be stopped? He can hire a company to dig holes and plant bombs under a city the size of New York, which has a super-powerful police force that has stopped all crime? Meanwhile, how does Bruce Wayne, having escaped from Hellhole prison (in some nameless Middle Eastern desert country?) get back to the USA? And how does he suddenly ""manifest"" himself in Gotham? Others have pointed out many flaws in police behavior. The sudden disruption of the market, coming at the same time as Wayne supposedly bankrupts his own company—-this doesn't capture the attention of the SEC and other organizations? The Board can meet that very next day and make radical changes, despite having gone bust? The city that is the center of American capitalism can be taken over by a revolutionary mob of criminals, and the American economy doesn't collapse? What happened to the stock market the day AFTER Bane took over?What especially bothered me here was not so much the flawed plotting as the tedious pacing, the drawn-out series of climaxes, and the way the film suddenly just reverses course to give us a ""happy ending."" Batman ""rises"" just like Jake the Snake and then, despite a broken back, can accomplish all sorts of feats that a 25-year old marine would be hard-put to sustain.The place where it all goes wrong, as I see it, is the football stadium sequence. That sudden catastrophe has real terror and captures the current American nightmare of being destroyed somehow both from beyond and from beneath our own soil, by enemies within the ""body politic."" Nothing can quite top this moment after that, and instead we are left to gape at physically impossible stunt flying, school buses with children being shot at by policemen (!), and a time period that is much too short for the carrying of a nuclear bomb to a ""safe"" detonation site. (No tsunami? No radiation worries? No dead fish piling up on shore?) And if Wayne was using autopilot, where was he? I think every good or entertaining movie gets at least one or maybe two ""gimmes"" when it comes to flaws in narrative logic. If we're having a great time, we don't want to poke holes. But when again and again you start thinking, ""Now how could THAT happen?"" or ""How did she get there"" or ""What happened to his seemingly fatal knife wound (and who fixed it)?"" etc etc – well, then, enough is enough. (Here's one more: Selina gets a job as a maid at a party at Wayne Manor and then cracks his safe, getting a copy of his thumb print. How did she ever find the safe, if Wayne had become a recluse and the only staff around was Alfred? What did she know that we don't?)Movies today have to be so ""big"" and ""brutal"" and filled with terror(ism) to make people sit up and take notice. We forget that a story like this was once much simpler and could be told in a clear graphic comic-book style that had far more excitement, because that medium is much thinner and doesn't want you to think everything is ""really"" happening. (You project your own imagination onto the story, rather than having the story impose itself on you.) But when you have to make billions of dollars on a franchise, and spend four years on a project this size, the sense of values is all skewed. Who can really take pleasure at a film's ending, after such momentous turmoil has been stirred up? To make it worse, the whole thing has deep fascistic implications, that at least in the first two Spider-man movies were much less obvious. I'll take Tobey Maguire over Bale's gravel-voiced Batman any day, and feel that the world is a much better place with him around. He's sweet. And for a superhero, that's saying a lot!"
103,Gotham's reckoning.Well TDKR the last installment of the Nolan's Batman series ended in the perfect note the way trilogies are a supposed to end the real trilogy. So whats so great about this movie? This movie has it own moments when you get the chills on several occasions about whats is going to happen next it is almost breathtaking.Brilliant performances by all the actors in the movie.Hans Zimmer did it again by making the perfect score for the movie which will glue you to the seat and a wonderful plot which brings justice to the entire series. But but there is a but there are a few things which i felt should have been how it was which I am not going to mention because this needs to be a spoiler free review and i want it to be but this movie is worth every penny. Is this movie better than The Dark Knight? Well to that I have to think about it I cant sum up to the conclusion yet but again for me Batman Begins revolves around Batman The Dark Knight about the people of Gotham TDKR well why are you still reading this go watch it for yourself as i said it was worth every dime ...
104,"I am not a critic but an average movie goer , but I must say that this movie is a pale shadow of the previous movie . Missing the usual quality of a Chris Nolan movie . The movie lacks the frenetic pace of the previous title .First half of the movie is painfully slow . Second half picks up pace but still no big fireworks. Anne Hathaway unexpectedly performed very well in her role . Weak story line .Background score average .Villain is simply lame with a dog mask ,and is nowhere near the calibre of Joker.No great twists or surprise in the plot ,lacks suspense .Overall a better than average movie .Take my advice watch it at home ."
105,The writing is horrible and the pace is agonizingly draining.
106,"Every time a good superhero movie is made ,fanatic fanboys have to rush to IMDb to declare it as the ""Greatest Movie Ever Made"" LOL,, I do give them credit for a least being consistent. With that said, it was a good movie but should not even be in any top 100. Yes, the storyline was far fetched for real life but hey, it's the norm for a sci-fi thriller action movie. Villain wants to destroy stuff,, hero must stop him. It was well acted, and the action, while not ground breaking was shot very well. While Anne Hathaway is great to look at, and done an okay job , I felt you could of totally removed her character from the entire film and it would not have made any difference . It was almost like her role was just filler material. In the end to me it's just a fun summer movie to get lost in,,but not to put on a pedestal..."
107,"The biggest problem with The Dark Knight Rises is that its predecessor was The Dark Knight, potentially the greatest superhero film of all time as well as one of the best movies ever made. There was so much hype, so much anticipation for this one to be incredible, that for me it fell flat, and not just because it didn't match The Dark Knight but because it was in itself a mediocre film. Many people are saying that you can't always expect a sequel to be better than the movie before it, but the thing is you should. Why make a sequel if it isn't going to be better, if it isn't going to be more? While the Dark Knight had flow and mood, this was graceless. With The Dark Knight scenes built off of each other to form a feeling of absolute tension, making the film feel like one cohesive whole. This was full of different scenes that didn't form together gracefully or create a mood, and as a result the film didn't leave you with an overall impression, it didn't flow like it should've, and it felt much, much longer than it was. Nolan needed to challenge himself and dare to be better than the Dark Knight, but with this it seems he didn't. And also, was this Batman or 24? A nuclear bomb just doesn't fit. Along with this, Nolan missed a great opportunity to show Bane's back story in detail, maybe in flashbacks, and thereby enhance the movie. The fact that Batman was a pariah didn't really play a part with concern to Batman himself for more than 5 minutes, Batman making jokes and fighting in daylight was hard to watch, and his epic ""return"" was a bit too effortless for someone who's been out of it for 8 years. When all is said and done this film wasn't terrible, but considering what it followed and who made it it could've been so, so much more."
108,"Immediately, probably, it should be stipulated that I'm not a fan of superhero films, I'm not a fan of comics, and even from cartoons, I'd rather have chosen ""Tom and Jerry"" than a cartoon about Batman.
 But despite all the first two films of the trilogy described above, I liked them very much. The reason for this is probably the cool, noir atmosphere of Gotem created by the directors, the fine acting and, of course, the good script stories.
Well, after such a long introduction, it is logical to ask the question, what about the third part? Nothing! Absolutely nothing! In the final part of the trilogy there is absolutely nothing that I liked in the first two previous parts of the trilogy. The weakest part of the film is probably the script, and this fact is very surprising, as Christopher in all his works spent a lot of time developing the script (which is only the scenario of ""Memento""). Think about the reasons why the script in this picture is so weak you can endlessly. It is worth saying that most of the film is trying to build an exhibition, to reveal the main actors, but the author does not get it in the end, half the time is incredibly boring watching. So the script is so drawn and adjusted for the denouement that it's simply impossible not to notice it, it simply contradicts all laws of logic and healthy meaning. The performances of some scenes are very depressing, many battle scenes also give up cretinism, and it is not clear how they can be looked at. Yes, in the end, Christopher prepared his own story twist, but even he did not work and was predictable and boring. And as for the final scenes, I'm sorry, I could not stand it, how much forgiveness do I have to spit on all the laws of physics, science and just common sense, what would come up with this ?! Well, in general, with the plot all.
 The second question that arose after watching where the atmosphere of Gotham City had gone? Yes, she just took and evaporated not that noir style for which I loved the first two films of the trilogy, now Gotham is an ordinary boring metropolis, which is simply not interesting to watch. Why was this done or why? There are no answers, alas, it's sad.
 Well, the last point is an actor's game. Yes, I did not expect something outstanding. In principle, there was nothing outstanding on the screen, all that was that good actors gave out a good game and in sum with the above described it looked again extremely boring and not interesting.
It's time to sum up and draw some conclusions. This picture is the weakest in the filmography of a good director Christopher Nolan. As it is not surprising, but basically the script was let down, of course, as a result of which the whole film is simply impossible to watch, the atmosphere and appeal were lost as in the two previous parts of the trilogy. Who can recommend this film, well, probably only to fans of superhero cinema and comic book fans. To all other lovers of good cinema, this film is by no means worth watching. I have everything."
109,"The special fx and action scenes were cool. The acting by the badguy was not that great. One of the reasons for that was the mask he is wearing. You cant really see the facial expressions and also the voice acting was clearly recorded in studio afterwards. The bad guy visually looking is really cool. The badguy is not that great compared to the previous movie where heat ledger really carried the movie, tom hardy doesn't. Also the storyline and screenplay wasn't that good. They tried to put to much info in to short a time. The characters where a bit shallow because of that, they lacked depth. All in all the movie was entertaining, but not as much as expected."
110,"The disappointment of the year. could not imagine the duo of nolan brothers getting it wrong. this movie should have been titled "" Cat woman and Bane"" because Batman is just an impotent shadow of his old time over here. Cat woman aka Selina Kyle is given the major amount of the screen time and Hathway is a pretty competent Catwoman. Bane(Tom Hardy) is unfortunately all masked up so he can convey the menace only from the way he walks or talks in that Irish lilt. Michael Caine is excellent in the scenes he is in and so is Morgan Freeman. Marion cotillard is totally wasted. i could not really understand the necessity for her character in the movie and also could not fathom why an Oscar winning actor like her would go for such a two bit role. Joseph Gordon Lewitt creases his forehead throughout the movie and that is pretty much all he does. Christian Bale is above average but he cannot lift a screenplay which is weak and predictable from the very beginning. the only bright spot about the movie is its music which is better than the previous installments. This movie is a disappointment when considered in seclusion. when compared with The Dark Knight and Batman Begins, it is a f**king disaster. very very unhappy."
111,"When I saw the dark knight rises, I expected a villain who would be able to stand up to the acting which Heath Ledger had given in the dark knight. But I was disappointed with Bane's character even though Tom Hardy tried his best it didn't have the charm which the other two villains in the prequels had... Marion Cotillard didn't do what deserved of her role.. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine had no new form or structure even after 8 years, people change with time.. and u need to show at least some change in their character.... The only people who showed justice to their roles were Anne Hathaway as catwomen and Christian Bale.... The story was nothing exceptional. But I say to the people don't expect anything like the The Dark Knight... Just an ordinary story, with an ordinary villain with no character devlopment like the Joker or Ra al gul... And a batman who can and at no point feels weaker in courage than then villain... Overall I give it a 6 for just Anne Hathaway and Christian Bale's performance with the direction of Nolan."
112,"I don't normally review movies unless I feel compelled to do so. In this case, I feel I was duped into expecting a very good movie. Isn't that what I should have expected with an 8.5/10 rating?I won't get into the details, they're well-documented throughout these reviews. And I won't detail the nonsense that is considered a plot for those that may not have had the displeasure of viewing this movie. There are so many times that I was left shaking my head that I sustained a neck injury just watching this.I like the idea of Bane as a physically powerful foe, I like Anne Hathaway as Catwoman (although her character has serious flaws) and the veterans do their normal commendable job attempting to bring stability to this disaster.I gave it a 3 because I like Batman and I still want to like him. I will put this movie out of my mind so that I continue to like him."
113,"Nolan has got us accustomed to a very high standard of film making, no matter what he tackles as the subject. The Dark Knight trilogy is a very good example of this, when your typical superhero films can also stand as powerful pieces of cinema. Alas ""Dark Knight Rises"", after the exploding success of the brilliantly captured ""Dark Knight"", did fell short in comparison. Arguably, the success of any Batman film and even comic/graphic novel is dynamics between our dark hero and the villain, and in my opinion, Batman vs Bane was not taken to it's full potential. The tactical brilliance of Bane, portrayed by Hardy, was always out-shadowed by his brutality and sheer raw power, with a very dubious choice of voice effects that subtracted the terrifying factor right out of the equation, while Bale's performance was never stellar throughout the trilogy, this script did nothing to develop his character, mostly the opposite happened when you reach the end of this story. The big revelation concerning our villain only made the whole concept of Bane even less powerful, shedding some light into some questionable plot holes in the story, and there is an unwelcome sort of cheesy in all Joseph Gordon-Levitt scenes, unquestionably brought to light in the last minutes of the film. All in all, the film does feel like an ending, further deconstructing the myth of Batman, a vigilante created by a common crime by a faceless criminal, to fight so that someone wouldn't suffer through the same."
114,"A disappointing movie, Ben's character, despite the wonderful performance from Tom Hardy, that he was a character that was not up to par and the characters in the film made many stupid decisions"
115,"The Dark Knight Rises fails to capture the magic of its predecessors. While it was understandable to suspend disbelief for the Joker's antic because of his volatility, the same doesn't hold true for a cold and calculated Bane. This time the nihilistic philosophical lessons come off as pretentious and worn out. Even the repeated formula of action sequences pale in comparison to the first two films. What's left is a hastily done wrap-up of a film with zero character development for the supporting cast and a shallow narrative painted over a faux black."
116,"Okay, some major spoilers later on, but I'll let you know beforehand.First: Saw it at an advance screening after watching Batman Begins and The Dark Knight back to back. The story of The Dark Knight Rises (TDKR) is okay (except for a couple of things), but overall, it's long and dull. Maybe it was because I'd just seen TDK, which is a textbook exercise in movie tension and atmosphere, but I found that TDKR was simply lacking.It lacked tension, menace, and atmosphere. The story itself is okay apart from a few things that don't really make much sense (it's based partly on the Batman comic story Knightfall). It connects back to Batman Begins with the League of Shadows, which was okay.The villain, Bane, somehow lacks menace. He's big and tough, and beats a few people up, but not in any way that shows just how bad he really is. Maybe it's because you never really see much of his face, hidden as it is behind a mask of sorts (which they apparently made in a filthy middle-eastern jail), but there's no real facial expressions going on. This means that he's always kind of blank, even when describing horrors. Heath Ledger's the Joker was built on facial expressions (among other things), but Bane is devoid of them.His voice is also, I found, difficult to understand at times. Whether that's due to the cinema speakers or not, it was a little frustrating.The plot is pretty slow (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but it too lacks tension and emotion. The ingredients are all there, but it just doesn't work too well. I'm not sure that's the story's fault as much as the way it's told. Yes, things happen, but there doesn't appear to be much at stake overall. The movie lacks an emotional core.**Major spoilers ahead!** Okay, so Bane does a WWE move on Batman and almost cripples him. That's fine, and part of the Knightfall story. However, the problem is that it just doesn't feel important enough. By that I mean that Batman should have been broken spiritually _before_ this, making his physical breaking all the more damaging. It does go into it all, but it's not good enough. Batman enters the fight because he wants to, but his death-wish isn't pronounced enough. There's just something about it that didn't feel satisfying, but I'm not sure what.EDIT: My mistake. The whole point of trapping the people in Gotham is documented in the film, but that brings me to this point (and one of the film's greatest failures): We don't see the ordinary people of Gotham suffer. There's nothing of the impact of Bane's nefarious plans on them, and that's where the emotional heart of the movie is lost. It's all well and fine that Batman is going through some crisis, but he's always been about protecting the people, and without that as context, it's not as satisfying.The twist in the story is okay, if unexpected. It doesn't really add anything though.Overall, it's not as powerful as The Dark Knight, and lacks real tension. I don't think it will be anywhere near as successful as it's predecessor. That's a shame, because I think Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors around. He seems to have lacked the vibrancy here of his earlier work, though.6 out of 10."
117,"disagreeing with most reviews i've read so far i thought the movie was flat. It just seem to never find it's footing. i found myself bored at times and had no problem getting up to get more popcorn in the middle of the movie. Catwoman was awesome. i really wish there was more of her in the movie. bane was not quite as awesome. he just didn't give me that omg what is he going to do feeling that i got with heath. I also dislike that they reused plot items from previous installments, it would have been better without the connection. The middle of the movie is like a long montage that could have been given some theme music and condensed to about 10 min. dkr had an overall bad flow which brushed over things that could have been flushed out more and dwelled on things that could have done with out.The movie is worth a watch but don't expect to be blown away like with the dark knight."
118,"Disappointed as a viewer. The worst thing a film can do it to make the viewer step out of the film and say ""Give me a break"" If the film interrupts the viewing, it is flawed.Give me a break. Detonation of an atomic bomb off the coast of Gotham? The aftermath: Huge waves, devastation to the city. Radiation fall out for years. The suggestion that Batman is alive is also absurd. He had 5 seconds to detonation and had not dropped the bomb. NO WAY he could have reached any kind of escape velocity. And if his BAT vehicle submerged, which I doubt it did. He could not have survived the radioactivity and heat generated by the blast. This is just stupid writing. The film makers should have resorted to another scenario.Next, the entire police force crowded together in a massive mob heading toward city hall. That is just stupid. It may have worked in an old 1930s movie where UNION workers confronted private police and then fought it out with CLUBS, but to walk into a direct assault of canons? Have we learned nothing since the CIVIL WAR. Battles are not fought that way anymore. The police would have spread out, infiltrated the city hall via underground passages, used ropes to repel from buildings, and overwhelmed the bad guys, not walk in to certain death. The entire attack on city hall was plain stupid. Another example of pulling the viewer out of the film and making him say ""What the Hell?"".In fact, the movie should have been called BATMAN and CATWOMAN. Ann Hathaway was an equal to the Dark Knight and I might say did more to save the city that he did.BANE was a bad dude, psychotic and menacing, but his mask was his Achilles heel. It was much too vulnerable and as such was a stupid idea. If the mask was controlling his pain, he needed to have it protected. All of the punches to his face would have been more than enough to disable this Darth Vader Wannabe. I did like the use of the Sean Connery voice. It added a bit of class the the maniac's demeanor.Also, having a Mideastern villain wanting revenge on Gotham? Old news since 911. Not very original.The film does show how vulnerable modern cities are to terrorism, but DUH! that Old news as well. Bottom Line. Too many flaws in logic and writing for me to really enjoy the film."
119,"As ""The Dark Knight Rises"" opens - picking up eight years after the events chronicled in ""The Dark Knight"" - we find eccentric billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a rather depressed state of mind. He has essentially withdrawn from the world, given up his crime-fighting ways and hung up his Batman cape, having largely fallen out of favor with the citizens of Gotham City who see him less as a hero and more as an out-of-control killer. Only his loyal servant/father-figure, Albert (the venerable Michael Caine), cares enough to give him a swift kick in the rear-end every now and again to try to get him to move on with his life. All this changes, however, when the fascistic Bane comes to town, a figure so consummate in his villainy that he is willing to blow up the whole blasted metropolis with an atomic bomb if he doesn't get what he wants.Though Christopher Nolan's latest entry in the series is nowhere near as engaging or as gripping as the previous two (especially the second), the movie attains a certain historical and contemporary significance with its echoes of both the French Revolution and Occupy Wall Street, though, oddly, the movie seems intent on putting us on the wrong side of history in both cases (rooting for a corrupt status quo and against a grass-roots uprising against that corruption).And, let's face it, Heath Ledger's Joker - one of the richest villains in all of movie history - would be a hard act for anyone to follow, and Tom Hardy's Bane, even with his mask and amplified voice, seems a mite tame in comparison. On his own terms, however, Bane is reasonably effective, if only because of the implacable nature of his evil, which manifests itself in his willingness to sacrifice masses of innocent people to enrich his own power.Thanks partly to the muddled politics and partly to the overstuffed nature of the storytelling, the movie never finds a way to fully engage its audience in the world it's created. In fact, in comparison to the narrative sturdiness of its two predecessors, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" comes across as a bit of a messy affair overall, with subplots spinning off in all directions, with little gravity at the core to bind it all together. A case in point: while Anne Hathaway brings a degree of flirtatious charm to the role of cat burglar-turned-Cat Woman, the character as a whole seems like an afterthought, tacked onto the story to provide some counter-balancing romantic interludes for the sullen, all but monastic Wayne.The cast is rounded out by Gary Oldman, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Aaron Eckhart and others, but, more so than in the two previous entries in the series, the real stars of ""The Dark Night Rises"" turn out to be the visual pyrotechnics and special effects."
120,"After the Dark Knight was released I couldn't avoid the hype that surrounded it and decided to give the two first movies a watch. I thought both movies were okay but not spectacular, apart from the memorable Joker. The thing is, i can't just name exactly what caused it but both movies just bored me a bit. I think this feeling is caused mainly because the world of Gotham doesn't get a lot of attention. Sure, we see skyscrapers, Batman's mansion and an occasional location for a fighting scene but it isn't enough, it makes the city feel like a cardboard background, which for me just kills the atmosphere and chance to immerse myself in this fictional world. Besides this, i like Christian Bale in most movies but as Batman...he just can't convince me! The fact that he changes his voice when being Batman doesn't help, it just sounds silly. But okay, I was entertained enough to watch the close of the trilogy and i must say, it was the best movie of the three. Bane is an awesome bad guy and the movies has some 'big moments' (that collapsing stadium!) that shocked me. My biggest complaint is that the pace of the movie slows down considerably after the stadium scene. It seems that after Bane conquers Gotham he just does NOTHING! Then it is just a matter of time before Batman saves the day. The ending was cool though but again...this trilogy just isn't for me. In most cases i can understand/share the love for a movie/trilogy but here it seems i am living in a different dimension, a dimension in where i think Gotham should be portrayed as a vivid but grimy city, with things like crazy nightlife filled with shady characters and a Batman who talks like Batman..even when he is off duty."
121,"Christopher Nolan's Batman films have both surprised & disappointed me. On one-hand, Nolan has strived to ground the mythos into as realistic and relatable setting as possible. Given the suspension of disbelief needed for most of these comic book adaptations, the change was risky and admirable. However, along the way, specifically with the second film 'The Dark Knight', Nolan's realistic setting is at odds with increasingly implausible and fantastical happenings. This sense of imbalance carries over to the bloated & meandering final film.'Rises' spends the greater part of its nearly three-hour runtime in escalation, introducing plot lines & characters that serve too embellish a sense of importance & complexity too the proceedings. The main issue with the film is that the majority of the multiple plot lines are poorly executed and unnecessary. For example, while the character played by Anne Hathaway adds a touch of much needed sarcasm & sensuality to the overtly serious proceedings, her motivations & actions are never explained.On the other hand, the characters of Bane & John Blake were well-etched and save the film from outright mediocrity. Bane is equal parts fascinating & menacing, with a convincingly crafted back story that forms the emotional core of the film. Whereas the Joker is the titular villain in the Batman mythos, he is ultimately an absurd character that lacked development & conviction in the previous film. While I never viewed Joker as a legitimate threat in the previous film, Bane's actions are well-plotted & he challenges Batman accordingly. However, both characters actions are ultimately unrealistic, resulting in a film that is neither crime drama nor superhero fantasy.John Blake is the only other character in the film that is well-etched. Unlike Lt. Gordon, Lucius Fox, & Alfred, Blake rises above being mere plot device & garners genuine emotion through a well-developed back story, realistic staging, & strong motivations/actions. As it stands, I found Gordon-Levitt's Blake a far more convincing & interesting character than anything Nolan has written for Bruce Wayne since the end of the first film.Thus lies the main problem with 'Rises', Bruce Wayne & his Batman alter-ego come off as emotionally stilted & reactionary rather than mature & intelligent. This is most likely based on the poor narrative in the previous film, where I had trouble buying into Wayne's relationships & Batman's fall from grace. The character has simply failed to develop since the first film.It's not helping that the films script & technical aspects are also poorly manipulated. While Nolan's script for Begins was generally competent, it's still hard to digest moments of thought-provoking dialog intermixed with sophomoric dramatization, & cheesy one-liners.While a few scenes stood out in this film, particularly in the beginning sequence & Bane's prison, the cinematography on display lacked any sort of flourish, reveling in gritty skylines & explosions over any sort of interesting composition. The action sequences are admirable, if not poorly shot. Sound editing & mixing are first-rate. The score by Hans Zimmer is abysmal.Overall, The Dark Knight Rises is a film that falters due to a weak foundation. 'Rises' ambition & scope are grand, however, it's setting and characters lack development and conviction, ultimately rendering much of the proceedings hollow & self-important. As summer entertainment, Dark Knight rises is the best of the bunch, a gem amongst a sea of nameless sequels, testosterone driven action films, regressive family fare, & tasteless comedies. As a film, however, 'Rises' has no reason to exist, it stands tall amongst such relevant masterworks as 'Avatar' & 'The Matrix'.Stay for the taut & thrilling opening sequence that introduces Bane's character, than fast-forward through the rest."
122,"I didn't really enjoy the Christopher Nolan trilogy, and I am not sure why. I don't think there was anything in them, thematically or otherwise, that really interested me. I liked the villain, Bane, mostly for his cool accent. The movie had a decent build, with Bane defeating Batman and taking over Gotham, but I really didn't follow what it was for. Then the final sequence where they are trying to find the bomb in time felt really generic. Another superhero-saves-the-world-at-the-last-minute type of deal that had zero interest or suspense. I really don't care about any of the questions that the movie might be raising about how far does Batman have to go to stop terrorists who don't play by any rules. I didn't care about any of the characters or performances, except maybe Gary Oldman. By the time we find out about Talia and who everyone is, I felt like everything had deflated. It was well made, but I was just never into it."
123,"The movie repeatedly refers to events that happened in past movies as though viewers are intimately familiar with those details. If you don't really remember what happened there, be prepared for an eternity (2:45) of asking what's going on. Thankfully though, there is still enough new material to keep the movie reasonably interesting on its own.I was left feeling unclear about Bane's motives for wanting control of Gotham City and I didn't understand the financial arrangements that Bane invoked to inflict pain.Plenty of the police elements were ridiculous, for example, how could the sewer gang grow so large without the police knowing about it? Furthermore, Bane not only pre-empts, but relies upon some of the police's actions even though those actions are only triggered by what's presented as genius breakthroughs.Batman's habit of refusing to use guns is childishly naïve, inconsistent and it occasionally causes the deaths of police. This is a movie that gave me a strong urge to yell at the screen and give advice to the main character."
124,"I always feel like I am missing something whenever the latest BEST COMIK FILM EVAR comes along. The release of TDKR (and resulting mob mentality) is just the latest example.I enjoy Batman Begins, largely because it has quite a lot of variety in what's shown on screen. The origin story is presented nicely without dragging on. I also think they did a good job with Scarecrow and his trippy brand of terrorism.TDK was a bit of a fork in the road for me. Most people I know loved it, while I found it sloppy, pretentious, vaguely neocon, and quite ridiculous where technology was concerned. I appreciated the amount of time given to a strong Joker, though I do feel like Ledger went a bit too hammy with all the lip smacking and other mannerisms. It should be said that I am a permanent fanboy of The Wire, so complicated plots and many characters are nothing special to me (esp when you have hundreds of millions to buy the best talent in the biz). TDK delivered a pseudo version of an intellectual comic book flick, and everyone went wild (combined with Ledger's performance).By the time TDKR rolled around, I was expecting Nolan's muddy politics, pretentious writing, odd casting, and sterile visual style, yet I still came away disappointed. It's just so dull. I was invested for about 45 minutes, at which point I (like a certain someone's back) broke. Endless gum flapping ensues re: why people need heroes, why heroes need people, why cops need Batman, why Batman needs women, why Alfred needs Batman, etc.. For about an hour, I was praying for death. Then the obligatory urban terrorism finale begins. Great, we get to see ANOTHER NYC-esque city being threatened by bombs while being torn apart? Haven't people tired of this propaganda? All the resources in the world, and ANOTHER ticking timebomb is the best they could do? It made me sad when people applauded at the end, because it cemented the divide in our society. I see movies like TDKR as pure propaganda for our new, post-9/11 world. Why people eat it up is beyond me, and why they insist on calling it ""best movie ever"", ""best comic book film ever"", etc. is just baffling.If you like watching people run around dusty streets and alleyways while trying to decipher a needlessly-complicated, cliché plot, sign right up. I'm sure it will be as awesome as you need it to be.Ugh."
125,"Much like Zack Snyder's Meh of feels, TDKR is a bloated, incoherent mess. It's obvious that Mr. Nolan was forced into directing this movie so he could make interstellar. The film feels rushed and is poorly edited. There is a moment near the end of the film where a character says that they have 21 days till a bomb goes off. Then, literally in the next scene, they say they have 5 hours till the bomb goes. Apparently this film has a floating time line inside it's ridiculous running time. So many inconsistencies and plot holes that took me out of the film. Sure, the dark knight had some plot holes, but it never seemed to break the rules of the universe it was set in. This film breaks the rules established in the previous films in every scene. How did nearly every single cop in the city get lured into the sewers in the first place? They couldn't have a drone or a robot check and then send a swat team down? This film also has the distinction of being too long and not having enough in it. There must be scenes on the cutting floor that would've made some of the stranger and downright stupid parts of this film make more sense. The best parts of this film are the parts I was skeptical about. Hathaway's Catwoman is fantastic and fits well in this universe, as does the menacing Bane- who Tom Hardy emulates with very cold and haunted eyes. The fight scenes are great, and the acting is top notch. But something seems...Off. The writing is more on the nose than in the dark knight, and some parts don't add up. The pit in this movie seems like it belongs more in Inception.The ending to this movie is what really ruined it. Another race against the clock climax that's been done ten thousand times before. The 'twist' could have also been done better. The most disappointed I had ever been in a sequel until the force awakens was released. A 5 out of 10 for Chris Nolan's worst film."
126,"There is not much to say about TDKR, because after some days there is not much left in my movie-loving-mind. Not much except this: a disappointing villain, who is beaten in a fist-fight (!!!) and without any cool action which wasn't shown already in the trailer ... a batman who was once struggling about his gone love-of-a-lifetime Rachel but bangs now two girls in a row ... a main villain who suddenly plops out after bane is dead but acts just some minutes as head of the bad ... and a foreseeable average climax with an atomic bomb (how creative is that???). Where was the epic conclusion? where was Batmans inspiration to the people (not just Blake), were was Alfred??? TDKR is technically well done. But thats it. Don't be stupid and let cheat you by that! Not a bad movie. But not more."
127,"you disappointed me Nolan, what the f? -cheesy way of ending conflicts -uninteresting characters. -deus ex machine in its cheap form. -sleepy time in action sequences (not in the ""more hardcore action, images that balance content"" persuasion). -destroyed the image of a passionately followed character (not talking about batman). -are you going to slack in next project? -more preproduction man, think stuff trough. -where you in contract debt to finish the movie or something? -you know you are better than writing stuff for the ridiculous ""10 line in comment"" rule last night i proved my girlfriend its a hassle to take care of one another while drunk"
128,"The most anticipated movie of the year has arrived, and I'm sorry to say, but at least for this moviegoer, it disappoints. The Dark Knight Rises is such an overly ambitious film that it tries to pack in way more than it can handle. I know I am in the minority here, but by the final hour of the movie all that I really felt was overkill.This is the capper in Christopher Nolan's trilogy which re-booted the franchise and did indeed make it more respected than it was after the last few Batman films of the 90's. This series has a much darker tone which I always preferred over the lighter fare of other superhero movies like the Spider-Man ones. The dark tone still works well here, but it's hindered by the blown-up storyline. Just as many people observed with Spider-Man 3, there's just too much going on here. It's not that the new characters of Bane and another Catwoman are what bring the film down; it's just that everything is so dragged out in scene after scene. In fact, the re-introduction of Catwoman was one of the things that worked best. I've never been much of a fan of Anne Hathaway, but her scenes were often the best ones. This is a much smarter and slicker Catwoman than we've ever seen before. And that's exactly what you should expect of a character of that name. Maybe a little more of her and less of some other characters would have served the movie well.Aside from a drawn-out plot about Batman (Christian Bale) being gone for 8 years and Bruce Wayne trying to get his alter-ego mojo back, it seems like the movie tries a little too hard to give ample screen time to all of the other actors as well. It wants to make sure that returning veterans like Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are properly accounted for along with all the new guys played by Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Matthew Modine, and Anne Hathaway. This results in many unnecessary scenes in my opinion. There's also a little surprise about one of the characters at the end of the film, but it was something I had already figured out at the beginning. And while the primary villain Bane (played by Tom Hardy) is menacing in his physical appearance, it is a little odd that they chose to give him a voice that sounds like an old geezer from England.All in all, The Dark Knight Rises was just a bit of a letdown for me. It's not that the expectations were so high that they were hard to live up to, but I actually found this Batman film to be the worst in the trilogy. I have noticed that each one of them has a prolonged climax at the end, but this one seemed 3 times as long and I found myself zoning out while trying to stay interested. At 2 hours and 45 minutes, it really just became a movie loaded with a lot of filler. I mean Malcolm X was 35 minutes longer, yet didn't feel nearly as long as this. There's nothing wrong with a lengthy film as long as each of the scenes are interesting or important to the story. In this case, they were not."
129,"I fail to see how this film is so highly rated, the film bored me to death, it seemed like over half the film was slow, tedious buildup revealing how Wayne became isolated from the outside world after taking the fall for Dents death, and although this was done well, the film failed to grab my attention throughout. The film introduced a set of new characters such as Blake and Foley but it failed to develop the characters and I felt no attachment to them. As for Bane, the main villain in the film, the character was incredibly false, the characters crippling mask led to there being a voice-over for Bane, which took away from any atmosphere, it just felt like Bane was speaking via a recording studio, no matter where the location, the voice never changed in volume or acoustics. As for Catwoman there was nothing sexy about the character, every kiss was done when the camera was at the back of a characters head, blocking the kiss itself, there was no sexy combat either, as done in other Movies and Video Games, the sexiest she got was trapping a villains hand with her high heel but that was it. It seemed like she was just thrown in a cheap attempt to boost interest/paying customers, but there was no reward When it came to acting Christian Bale did a great job, however even his aggressive Batman voice seemed half-hearted, Oldman, Hathaway and Gordon-Levitt gave good performance but with 50% of Banes face covered by metal and leather its difficult to say Tom Hardy did a good job. However, the real star of the film was Michael Caine, he had a number of emotional scenes and delivered brilliantly where he held back tears and struggled for words and made me appreciate the genius he has. There weren't that many graphics in the film apart from a few gadgets (in which there were only one or two) and some random explosions (believe me, the scene in the baseball stadium in the advert is as good as it gets) If you are reading this and thinking, how can I say these things, look back at The Dark Knight, compare the acting, villain and tension from that film with this one and you should understand what I mean, I felt more under threat when watching Heath Ledgers Joker than Tom Hardys Bane *Slight spoiler* (not even a cameo from Liam Neeson could save DKR)In conclusion this film is a boring, long-winded and unthrilling motion picture with mediocre acting and unimpressive visuals, Catwoman seemed to be thrown in and the poor voice acting for Bane made the character seem unbelievable and artificial, the film just seems to rely on its franchise after Nolan's The Dark Knight to win over fans and it seems to have worked on the majority - if you want a thrill ride with the Batman name go see The Dark Knight on DVD because that is a much better film than the DKR - cheers for reading"
130,"Rewatch. I rated The Dark Knight Rises (2012) 5/10. This just dosnt hold up. It's way all over the place & is just poorly written with tons of illogical plot points. It does have some decent action & good cinematography, but it can't save a shambling film.Considering this is Nolan's ""worst"" movie, he has still had an amazing career run as a director."
131,"I know that most people, when they think of Bane, automatically think about Joel Schumacher and his Horrible, attempt at a Batman movie. Or they will think of Chris Nolan and the third installment of his Batman Trilogy. Personally, I think that BOTH depictions of Bane are Horrible. I have two reasons; First off, Personality. Bane is supposed to be a smart and calculating gang leader and mercenary. Nolan got that (but a little exaggerated in my opinion because he made Bane less of a Gang leader and more of a Cultist Priest). But Schumacher completely missed the mark, making him a mindless brute. Second; Appearance. Schumacher was practically spot on with Bane in the costume department, albeit adding some embellishments here and there like the multiple tubes (as opposed to just one), the device on his chest (rather than on his wrist), and the green veins etc. And, in my opinion, those additions/changes actually work and even make sense. Nolan however, his Bane looks nothing like the comics. That guy is just a big ex-con in a flak-jacket, fur coat, fatigues, boots and a souped up gas mask. I get that Nolan wanted to make this incarnation of Batman more gritty and realistic and I respect that, but at least the other villains Looked like themselves. Scarecrow: Costume reduced to just a mask. Ras Al Ghul: No Cape or scimitar. Joker: Mutated face reduced to scars and badly applied make-up. Two-Face: No Custom suit. But in all of this as I said, they were still recognizable.So, All in All, both Banes were terrible."
132,"There is a Difference between Cynical and Depressing. There is a Difference between Dark and Dull. There is a Difference between Gotham City and New York City.What has Happened to Batman in this Film? That Cool, Stylish, Mysterious, Haunted, Brooding, Anti-Hero that, at its Best, is an Art-Deco meets Noir meets Pulp Creation.There is a Difference between Cynical and Depressing. There is a Difference between Dark and Dull. There is a Difference between Gotham City and New York City.What has Happened to Batman in this Film? That Cool, Stylish, Mysterious, Haunted, Brooding, Anti-Hero that, at its Best, is an Art-Deco meets Noir meets Pulp Creation.All of that is Siphoned away to Make way for this Unstylish, Long and Boring Gab-Fest about Modern Angst like Terrorism and Financial Fat Cats.This is a Meandering, Muddled Mess of a Movie that Under Utilizes Batman and brings forth a Mumbling Hulk of a Villain that is Void of anything but Brute Force. This is a Lifeless Movie.Catwoman is the only Character that seems to have a Heartbeat and is Not Mentally Scarred and has a Biting, Satirical Sense of Humor. When She Barbs is the only time the Movie Rises above the Glum and Gloom in this Disappointing End to the Director's Trilogy.The Fight Scenes between Batman and Bane are Boring and Lame. You would think that Batman, suffering from a Back Break and a Blown Knee, would Resort to some Bat-Gadgets.No, its just a WWE Slug-Fest. The Clunky Bat-Plane is another Step Down from the Clunky Batmobile in its Lack of Cool and is a Square, Flight-Unfriendly, Ugly looking Thing.Overall, this is a Dud. The Bat-Suit is the only thing on Screen that is Worthy of the Batman. The rest is a Laborious Misuse of the Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, the Super-Hero that is Super-Powerless. This Comic Book Character that is Deserving of so Much More."
133,"After the sudden death of Heath Ledger, many were doubting that Christopher Nolan would continue his version of Batman. In fact, it came as a surprise in 2011 when the film was actually announced.Choosing to not recast the role of the Joker, Nolan elected to bring the Ra's Al Ghul story full circle and make that the central plot of the third and final film of his trilogy.The story is an exposition machine when it begins. Bruce Wayne/Batman hasn't been the latter in eight years due to an injury he sustained and is also battling with grief over the loss Rachel Dawes (still?). His company is reeling after he abandoned a multi-billion dollar energy project, but a board member named Miranda Tate is still trying to get him to go through with it. While this is going on, a new villain is on his way to Gotham named Bane, who kidnaps a doctor and needs him for a specific mission within the city. To make matters worse, Bruce's fingerprints are taken by a cat burglar named Selina Kyle, whom is working for the man who is in charge of Bane and does this in exchange for a clean slate. Also, we follow a new police officer named John Blake, who not only knows Bruce Wayne is Batman but is somehow able to figure out everything the entire rest of the Gotham police can't.There is a ton of story in this film, and the biggest problem is that it not only goes against the Batman mythology established in the comics but it also goes against the first two Nolan movies as well.That's why this film is sort of depressing because it has the ingredients to be great. It's well shot, acted, and has some tremendous sequences. This should have been as good, if not better, than its predecessor based on that but it falls extremely short due to Nolan attempting to push the envelope in areas he shouldn't have.As I stated in my review of The Dark Knight, the film is tremendous until its third act, particularly its ending. The ending is extremely flawed in that movie, and this movie built on that ending, which is the preliminary problem with this entire movie.For one, Batman takes eight years off due to the death of Rachel. I know they throw in the knee injury but as it proves in the movie he was able to get rid of that in no time. That logic just flies right into the face of every Batman comic including the more comedic 1960s version of Batman. This is a character that doesn't give up for anything. Also, making Rachel the excuse is tough to swallow for a character that watched his parents get gunned down in front of him.Another issue is this revenge story that they try to weave with Ra's al Ghul's daughter, Talia. As she poses as Miranda Tate, she does a multi year plan to help Bruce Wayne create a clean energy project that could be turned into a nuclear bomb to destroy Gotham. While I'm happy that a movie took the time to introduce Talia into a live action movie, it was the most convoluted story they could've given her, and is easily one of the worst revenge stories I've ever seen in cinema.Bane is good for the most part. Tom Hardy did fine but he really needed to be the solo villain. Making him the lackey for Talia undid everything they had established for this movie. It also doesn't help that he's killed off so easily.Catwoman was a welcome surprise. Anne Hathaway proved a lot of people wrong and plays it well. Now if only Nolan could have allowed her to be called Catwoman in the movie that would have been awesome. However, in Nolan's realistic world, there's a problem with calling most of these characters by their comic book names.The character of John Blake is interesting, and also infuriating because of the way he's written. I can get by that he knows who Batman really is but the orphanage story that he gives was not the best direction to take with it. Also, it was just weird that they did this M. Night Shyamalan reveal with his legal name being Robin. It was less clever and more throwing a bone to the actual comic fans that would be seeing the film.The ending also doesn't help the film either, because it's also an M. Night Shyamalan reveal. To me, the ending is what made the rest of the film tough to handle, because it was already a difficult plot to fully get behind. And instead of doing the things that you would expect them to do, they elected to swerve the entire audience by doing something else. That can be clever at times, but can be infuriating other times, with the Dark Knight Rises being very much the latter in my eyes.So overall, I love the film for its look, the cinematography is great, the action is serviceable, and the acting can be downright brilliant. However, the storytelling and the plot just go down a deep rabbit hole with no chance of climbing out. It does way too much and creates more questions than it does answers."
134,"First off, I am a HUGE fan of the first 2 Batman films. I think #1 was stylish, intelligent, had great gadgets, fantastic performances and set the stage for a terrific new series. The second Batman was equally as explosive and of course the performance by Ledger was phenomenal. He had a chilling presence every time he entered the frame. That kind of chemistry is hard to create thru the magic of film. So let's get to it, shall we? This last chapter (it's only labeled ""last"" to further hype the series, as we all know ""Robin"" is just around the corner) was an overblown miss. It's almost as if everybody got tired and substituted genius film making for guns and explosions.1)First of all, there were no new gadgets!! Hello?? This is Batman! Part of the initial fun of watching Batman is getting to see all the great new toys. All they did was whip out a flying space ship and said, ""O.K., we've given the audience enough."" It's like a James Bond movie, we need to see the new toys we'll never get to play with.2)There was no humor at all. Nothing cute or charming to snicker or laugh at. The pacing of the film was beyond dark, it was boring. Toss in a little ""Batman humor"" to balance the explosions and gun fire with.3) Which leads to the gun fire and explosions. The film had about 90 Min's of pure gun fire and bombs going off. Again, no pacing, just explosion after explosion with multitudes of guns, guns, guns, in almost every scene. It was mind numbing. The terror should be in the mind, not in the gun. It's almost as if the writers gave up and inserted a gun in every time they came to a blank spot. Cut about 30 Min's of guns out of the film so the movie wouldn't run about, what 4 hours? 4) The film editing was so over the top choppy and jumped around so quickly between time frames that I thought it was cut by a first year film maker. OK, we get it, they are trying to be stylish and creative, but there were so many continuity mistakes in the film it's hard to know if they were created by bad editing or just bad production.5) Story. NO STORY. Beyond simplistic. Save the city by throwing the bomb in the ocean at the end? That gets a huge PAAAALLLEEEEZE. It reminded of the original series when Batman was on TV and they had to get rid of the ""bomb"" by dropping it in the ocean. Hilarious. Is that the only thing these top notch writers could come up with?? Really??6)And this is my biggest complaint. Bane. What a huge Darth Vader RIP OFF. Come on, it's like somebody borrowed Darth Vader and forgot his helmet. I didn't buy his ""wannabe mini Darth Vader voice"" either. Totally overdubbed, and extra loud like some cheap post production house did it. My favorite part was when Batman was punching him in the face over and over and his little mouth piece just wouldn't budge. Oh, I forgot, it had a little leather strap holding it on his mug. OH, and when Bane did that back breaking knee crunch to Batman's back and his only problem later was a slipped disk? OK, now we are really stretching reality... which by the way, is what made the first 2 Batman's so great is because they were based on reality.And the very last scene, was clever, but they screwed that up as well.Here's how the ending should've gone: Show the restaurant, Show Alfred sitting at the table, he looks up, appears to be looking at something... and smiles. Cut to black.That's how you end it. Now we all could've speculated what he was looking at and the mystery surrounding Batman if he was alive or not would've been created. But NO... they ruined it by SHOWING Batman sitting there with Cat Dish, sipping tea, and removed all the mystery out of the stigma that is Batman.Who writes this crap?What a let down. Creativity and story has indeed fallen from the series. I predict ""Robin"" will be more of the same, lots of explosions and acrobatics with no substance or story for the mind to enjoy. But hey, if you're 14, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT."
135,"After a third viewing, I cannot praise enough how much I adore this movie. It is another magical film made by a director on a role since 2000, Christopher Nolan.There is so much to love about the conclusion. Our favorite characters are back. The story itself is superbly told, the acting is brilliant, the music is superb, the action scenes are brilliant and the dialogue is good but cheesier than ever before Tom Hardy looked the Bane for this movie. Christian Bale had not lost it with Batman, neither had Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman or Michael Caine. The story was very well told and honestly, the dialogue in the movie is good but very cheesy, adding much unnecessary dialogue parts such as Bane- ""So you have come back to die with your people"" Batman- ""No, I came to stop you"" That part would've been a whole lot more powerful without Batman delivering any dialogue. There are certain dialogue points that do let the movie down, but only for an instance. There wasn't five minutes in the movie where I felt bored. It was that entertaining The direction by Nolan...is well....BRILLIANT! He has done it again. The beauty about Nolan, despite his immense success with the Dark Knight is that he was able to start right back from the beginning in this movie. He knew the job had to be done new and that he had to go back to the basics if he were to succeed The characters are great. Bane was superb. Blake was great as was every other character who was there The movie was emotionally draining and intensely exciting. The comedic lines were done well but the script could've been a bit better. My only real issue with the movie is in the DVD where some scenes contain black bars but other scenes do not have any. It would've felt much better if the entire movie contained no black bars or black bars all the way through.*Spoilers ahead** The plot twist at the end of the movie with the discovery that Miranda is actually Talia Al Gul, the daughter of Ra's Al Ghul and friend of Bane, who all along was just a protector was a surprising plot twist. By the end, we are emotionally connected with Bane Bane's death however was a vast disappointed when he just gets blasted away by Catwoman. Despite having a fight, seeing his torture himself to death would've felt far more satisfying than getting blown to smytherines.Batman's supposed death was handled very well and despite knowing what happens, I still felt teared up.***End of spoilers** Overall, the Dark Knight Rises is a must get movie for DVD and is a very satisfying conclusion to an epic triloy, suffering very minor issues with some cheesy dialogue sequences."
136,"I really wanted to like the last part of Nolans Batman trilogy; after all, together with the first ""X-Man""-movie and Watchmen"", Batman Begins"" and The Dark Knight"" were among the few comic book adaptations that actually worked. ""Batman Begins"" gave new life to a franchise that was crippled by Schumacher's ""Batman and Robin"", while ""The Dark Knight"" had one of the most iconic performances of recent years (and I'll give you a hint: it wasn't Bales performance).Where did the final part go wrong? Well, to begin with, it had all the weaknesses of ""The Dark Knight"", without having TDKs strong points. Bane is not nearly as iconic a villain as was the Joker, and although Tom Hardy does a decent job, he's never able to out-Herod Herod. Plus, it doesn't help that his mask renders him pretty inaudible – I mean, the hero growls, the villain mumbles; come on Nolan, was it part of the concept that the audience cannot understand the main characters? Bale is going through the routine, agreeable as usually, be it as the Howard Hughes-like reclusive millionaire or, later, as more or less rejuvenated Bruce Wayne. Yet, if that is at all possible, his growling and grimacing whenever he's wearing the Batman costume (which seems even chunkier compared to the sleek suit in ""Batman Begins"") is even more annoying than in the previous parts.Caine, Oldman and Freeman have little more than cameo appearances. Speaking about the supporting roles: the first two films did a good job casting actors like Rutger Hauer, Michael Jai White or Eric Roberts (to name but a few) in small but effective roles; the third installment features mainly bland, uninteresting extras. It's almost a relief to see 'veterans' like Cillian Murphy and Liam Neeson, but again, their appearances are limited to the blink of an eye.Like in the prior installments, Nolan once again presents the villains as thinly disguised terrorists rather than super powered megalomaniacs. However, other than the Jihadist-like Ras-al-Ghul or the urban terrorist Joker, the Bane character is distinctly influenced by contemporary events, namely the ""Occupy Wall Street""-movement which was briefly trendy last year and was the butt of jokes for all but followers of this movement. Not exactly a good premise for a supposedly impressive scenario.As for the finale: it's neither as grand as the hype would have demanded it, nor is it as witty as it thinks it is. That the non-canonical figure of John Blake would inherit the cowl of the Bat was as foreseeable as tomorrow's sunrise. Rather than a grand showdown between Bane and Batman, Bane is relegated to a mere henchman at the end of the film and disposed off rather unceremoniously; almost as if the Joker had slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck halfway through ""The Dark Knight"".It's not mindless, CGI-driven Popcorn cinema like the recent string of Marvel-Superhero films but its trying way too hard to disguise that in essence, the Batman films are first and primarily action flicks.""TDKR"", despite its convoluted storyline, plot-holes big enough to let the bat-plane fly through and often annoying acting, is a solid action flick but wants to be more – but the wish remains the father of the thought.5/10"
137,"I really can't understand why grown adults take these movies seriously. It's an over long, overly serious comic book movie. It has all the trappings of a real movie, big budget, A list actors and a big name director but it's like sitting down to a sumptuous feast only to find that under the facade it's all made of bubble gum."
138,"I really liked the first two movies of this trilogy and so I was thrilled to bits at the opportunity to watch Dark Knight Rises when it appeared on my TV screen.But oh! How I was disappointed! This is one of the most frustrating let downs of a movie I've seen in a long time.Batman, far from street-fighting criminals from the off, spends long chunks of the movie first moping about his manor, then getting holed up in an underground prison. I think these episodes are supposed to show some kind of character development but they are just insufferably dull.Then there are the half-hearted introductions of Catwoman (half- hearted because they seem too embarrassed to allow this character to fully develop and end up portraying Anne Hathaway as a kind of confused burglar that dresses in black) and Robin.Thank goodness there's a decent bad guy or this movie would be an unmitigated disaster. Tom Hardy as Bane is a tour de force, a twisted, exaggerated, mad villain in the best traditions of all batman reproductions. He is so good that in the end it seems laughable that batman finally defeats him.Not great although just about watchable because of Bane. A let down."
139,"We've all seen Batman. We all know Batman. While many people would use different terms to describe him, we all know who Batman is, how he acts, what he does. We've seen him played by plenty of actors such as Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney and, my personal favorite, Kevin Conroy, and all of them have left a mark on the character for better or for worst. Then, there's Christian Bale. Don't get me wrong here, Bale's a great actor, but he just... he... can't... play... Batman. At all. As Bruce Wayne, he's great. As Batman, he's... a goof. My point is Batman in this movie is an idiot. Don't act like he isn't. He's a doofus. He sucks at his job. He gets his butt kicked, falls for every possible trap and (minor spoiler here) trusts Catwoman on her word. That is the absolute least Batman-y thing to do. Ever. And for the record, does every person in Gotham City know Batman's secret identity?! AND HIS VOICE SUCKS. COULD NO ONE ON THE SET JUST STOP HIM AND TELL HIM ""F*cking rre-- seriously?"" BEFORE HE MADE THREE WHOLE FILMS TALKING LIKE AN IDIOT?!With the Bat-rant out of the way, TDKR. I enjoyed the other two films (The Dark Knight was great, if not a bit overrated, but it was the best live action Batman film) but this one just... felt lazy. Yeah. It was a lazy film. The overall plot is terrible. It has holes so big you could drive the whole cast of the Transformers films through it (Bane's entire plan, alongside how he takes care of Batman makes no sense, sending the whole police down the drain, Batman's escape, the city surviving the bomb, etc.). Tom Hardy is a good actor, but he was terrible in this role. How do you take him seriously?! HOW?! He's hilarious! He was also nothing like the comics (minor complaint, I know). And Talia? Talia Al Ghul got f*cked sideways. Batman's equal, huh? Leader of the League of Assassins? Interesting character? Maybe a cool love relationship? Nah, let's just make her a whatever evil villain and make her have sex with Batman. Sure. Anne Hathaway looks WAY too young to play Catwoman. She's not that bad, I guess, but she didn't really fit the role. The movie moves at a snail's pace. I know it's Nolan, but Jesus. 30 minutes of Batman. In a three hour long film. It drags like a car with no back wheels.And as a last ""Screw you"" to the fans, Nolan casted Joseph Gordon Levitt as Notrobin so that he can tease the fans with Robin and then call him Robin. Like he's shaking the keys in front of your face. The movie isn't terrible, it's somewhat competent, certainly not the worst Batman film ever, but it is overrated. Way too much. Let's hope the next one get's it better."
140,"Batman Begins was a nearly perfect origin story, The Dark Knight is among the best sequels ever, and probably the finest comic book film ever made.. the third entry however is almost like everybody was ""well let's just be done with this trilogy, people will love it anyway!"" and most people actually did.. But the truth is this is full of plotholes or just lazy writing, dumb moments and worst of all wasted potential! This could have been so good, the premise is great, the talent behind it(both behind and in front of the camera) is phenomenal and yet for every good, cool or awesome thing in this, there are twice as many irritating, stupid and downright counter-productive moments that tear down important points the first two movies established. The villains plan from the first movie for Gotham doesn't make any sense anymore.. the whole point of the end of the second movie loses it's meaning.. the ending is absolutely atrocious and goes against the character of Batman and also is cringeworthy as hell.. This whole movie is a mess!"
141,"Been an avid comic book collector since 1970. This is the dumbest plotline, admittedly from the comics, that I've ever seen. Incredibly well made with a killer soundtrack this film wants the viewer to swell with the magnitude of the splendor of the gravitas blah blah blah. And it is inherently watchable due the commitment and acting chops of the actors, especially Anne Hathaway, who could read a ancient map in a foreign language wearing that catsuit as far as I'm concerned....but...What the hell? Does C. Nolan hate Batman? Having sat threw the mewling out of breath growl voice he gave Batman for three movies...I mean, even when the persons he talks to already know his identity, we have to endure Batman being beaten, tricked repeatedly, sleep with the effin villain for God's sake, lose his fortune, see his entire city, the one under his watch, become absconded...the entire city! Lordy. Not my Batman. Some detective. What good are all the gadgets and batcave mechanics if his entire city can be kidnapped.I'm only posting this because I sat threw this flick again and I see that gaudy 8.3 rating and I still want to yell at the screen. A movie is not just the thumping heart of a soundtrack ladies and gents. No where near as good as the Dark Knight."
142,"I am reminded of Lethal Weapon 4 (hell, Part 3 was the beginning of that series) during The Dark Knight Rises. True, people grow old and weary, but these are fictional characters and that's not what I wanted to see, for Gotham's sake. Likewise, I wouldn't welcome Sean Connery's return as Bond in today's world - I want to see my ""super"" hero be just that, not one hobble from retirement and doesn't ""go back for that one final job"" cliché.Allow me to explain. In The Dark Knight Rises, many years have passed from the previous installment - although you wouldn't know it with the many flashbacks, Bruce is sequestered and all-but in a wheel chair. Naturally, someone(s) sparks life back into the ancient Wayne and back-from-retirement comes Batman.Now, stating Batman returns (again) is not a spoiler - but this is: don't get used to seeing Batman for too long. He's in barely 10% of an almost 3-hour film. This very well-crafted film with very good cinematography and deep characters - both older, established ones and new ones, is an entertaining character-driven story, but light on both action and Batman.Personally, I like my Superhero/Comic Book movies with the actual Superhero at center stage. Obviously, that wasn't the goal, and so be it. It was entertaining for the other aspects.Bane (a barely understandable and muffled Tom Hardy) enters the realms of Gotham with a mission - and bang while burglar Selina Kyle (a delicious Anne Hathaway) steals various items for (no spoiler, but for very, very weak) reasons of her own. After countless conflicts with practically dozens of character pairs, Gotham is under siege and it's up to a broken man to ""learn to pick himself up"" again and save the day.(I really didn't want to give away the majority of the story or spoil any more - but in a nutshell, that's the gist.)While the movie isn't terrible, or bad by most reasons, it's filled with plot holes, pacing issues and a grand minimum of 40+ minutes could have been cut easily. That all said, it's worth a viewing and it was a nice conclusion to the Dark Knight trilogy. Also, I loved Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anne Hathaway and their characters.Suggestions for the inevitable reboot: MORE BATMAN. Oh, and keep a great story with great performances, definitely, but fit MORE BATMAN in there, please. Please."
143,"'Batman' series and in general the super-hero movies are supposed to be popular entertainment. Their 'literary sources' if they can be named so are in the comics books enjoyed by the kids and teenagers of the 30s and 40s which grew older and did not really know to much other literature, and then passed the same taste for direct action, plots that many time passed the border of the credible and 'deux-ex-machina' solutions of the story involving in most cases the super-heroes with their super-powers. After a first generation of movies building the premises of their success from the visual effects that tried to equate the thrills on the printed paper later productions emphasized other aspects of the story - like the romantic aspects (the 'Lois and Clark' TV series that I enjoyed greatly) or the growing pains of the hero on his path to become a reluctant superhero.Comes now this Nolan adaptation. I must say that I greatly admire Nolan for much of his early work, but my feeling was that in the New Batman series he simply failed. The million of dollars invested in special effects or in paying the superb cast (or I should say the cast of superb actors) are mostly lost in a story that grew too much became too complicated. I loved some of the early work of Nolan, movies like 'Memento' or 'Insomnia' with true characters faced with credible dilemmas in real life. Even in the later more sophisticated (and more expensive) movies like the Prestige or Inception his characters have their own truth despite the twist and a-reality of the stories. Here there are two many characters some of which are redundant with other, and the story becomes too complicated with no real reason (it can be easily told in 5 sentences and 50 words, but the film lasts close to three hours).Christian Bay, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine (where does his character hide for most of the film?), Marion Cotillard, Ann Hathaway, and the splendid Joseph Gordon Lewitt are all fine talents. Christopher Nolan is a fine director. The film they made? - not fine and even not fun."
144,"He's getting too old for this sh*t. Apparently.I am reminded of Lethal Weapon 4 (hell, Part 3 was the beginning of that series) during The Dark Knight Rises. True, people grow old and weary, but these are fictional characters and that's not what I wanted to see, for Gotham's sake. Likewise, I wouldn't welcome Sean Connery's return as Bond in today's world – I want to see my ""super"" hero be just that, not one hobble from retirement and doesn't ""go back for that one final job"" cliché.Allow me to explain. In The Dark Knight Rises, many years have passed from the previous installment – although you wouldn't know it with the many flashbacks, Bruce is sequestered and all-but in a wheel chair. Naturally, someone(s) sparks life back into the ancient Wayne and back-from-retirement comes Batman.Now, stating Batman returns (again) is not a spoiler – but this is: don't get used to seeing Batman for too long. He's in barely 10% of an almost 3-hour film. This very well-crafted film with very good cinematography and deep characters – both older, established ones and new ones, is an entertaining character-driven story, but light on both action and Batman.Personally, I like my Superhero/Comic Book movies with the actual Superhero at center stage. Obviously, that wasn't the goal, and so be it. It was entertaining for the other aspects.Bane (a barely understandable and muffled Tom Hardy) enters the realms of Gotham with a mission – and bang while burglar Selina Kyle (a delicious Anne Hathaway) steals various items for (no spoiler, but for very, very weak) reasons of her own. After countless conflicts with practically dozens of character pairs, Gotham is under siege and it's up to a broken man to ""learn to pick himself up"" again and save the day.(I really didn't want to give away the majority of the story or spoil any more – but in a nutshell, that's the gist.)While the movie isn't terrible, or bad by most reasons, it's filled with plot holes, pacing issues and a grand minimum of 40+ minutes could have been cut easily. That all said, it's worth a viewing and it was a nice conclusion to the Dark Knight trilogy. Also, I loved Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anne Hathaway and their characters.Suggestions for the inevitable reboot: MORE BATMAN. Oh, and keep a great story with great performances, definitely, but fit MORE BATMAN in there, please. Please."
145,"The Dark Knight Rises. The most anticipated film of the decade so far, and the finisher to an epic trilogy. Only perfection will do, it seems. Unfortunately, perfection is something that has arguably never been achieved in film, so asking that of Nolan may be a bit much. What should be asked of Nolan, however, is cohesion. And it is this which drags the film from an intelligent and deep thriller down to an average summer blockbuster. The lack of cohesion manifests itself in each element of the film, as sporadic directing hampers an ambitious story. When dealing with a story of this scale, intimacy is the key balance that must be applied; but intimacy is hard to find. We are given stacks of characters with their own branching stories, but none of them feel particularly fulfilled. Bane's history is lightly explored, and a dire lack of information is regards to Selina Kyle brings down what is otherwise a respectable performance from Anne Hathaway.Our titular hero is also handled bizarrely, being followed religiously by the story at the beginning of the film, only to be lost in a sea of scenarios by the second half.The reason the Dark Knight was so compelling was that it was focused - The Joker and Batman were polar opposites, and flowed seamlessly along the story line. But with Rises, the lines are blurred; as characters swap sides and back-stab with seemingly no reason or motive. Such flippant and fickle disregard can only be tolerated by the audience for so long.Overall, the film is a mixed bag of jarring ideas and contrived messages; but when stripped to it's core, it's an exciting and menacing spectacle. It's just a shame that its predecessor's integrity wasn't kept intact."
146,I can't understand the high rating this film gets on here. Not a poor film but a very average film. The narrative jumps all over the place with some very poor dialogue. The plot is so easy to predict. Michael Cane an actor I usually rate is a bit over corny as the butler! After the last film what a let down. The main bad guy is quite good and puts in a good menacing performance. Don't believe the hype! Hollywood are you creatively bankrupt?? It's a case of nothing new. Great action shots though. The special effects are good as to be expected with such a large budget. I've got to say this film could of been a whole lot better. It just seems to try and cram in too many individual stories around the main narrative.
147,"'Batman Begins' was a symbol of identity. 'The Dark Knight' was a symbol of hope. The Dark Knight Rises is a symbol of liberation. To release one's self from the shackles of our own imprisonment. Providing deliverance to the civilians of Gotham City, oppressed by both the disappearance of Batman and Bane's arrival, a physically intimidating terrorist. Gotham is thriving from the exploitations of a lie. A fabrication. The Dent Act. Eradicating organised crime and sentencing those criminals to life imprisonment within the walls of Blackgate Penitentiary. Batman, as the caped crusader, may not be wanted anymore. Yet he lives on, manifesting his iconography into the souls who witnessed his arresting power.Nolan's conclusive act in his rebooted trilogy serves as a reflection on America's political, economical and social structures. However, it's just not a very good mirror. It's cracked. Damaged by the success of its legendary predecessor that meshed realism with superhero shenanigans perfectly.Right, where to begin? The Dark Knight Rises is over two and half hours long. There is so much plot stuffed into that runtime, that the feature itself becomes plot and only plot. Essentially, it's all plot. Nearly every single line of dialogue from the Nolans' screenplay alludes to a plot mechanic, sub-plot, plot structure or foreshadowed plot point, resulting in minimal characterisation throughout. For example, after the events of 'The Dark Knight', Bruce Wayne becomes a recluse in his own lavish mansion. For eight years, he did nothing. Selina Kyle prowls the corridors one night, stealing pearls from a seemingly ""uncrackable safe"", and all of a sudden he shifts back into the Batsuit ready to take on Bane. The only genuine development between that transition is when Alfred endearingly confronts Master Wayne about burning Rachel's letter. That's it. In fact, throughout the entire feature, that precise scene is the only authentic moment where two characters interacted without having to further the plot. Another example? ""Hotshot"" John Blake becomes conveniently promoted to detective, just because Gordon believes he represents the idealism that the Commissioner once held, and somehow deduces Wayne's secret identity. Why? Well it's so that Wayne returns as Batman, Blake investigates Bane's implausibly merciless plan and to build up Blake's real identity right at the end of the film. There are no organic conversations between these two righteous individuals, inevitably forcing them to be mere objects for a narrative derived from a multitude of plots. This vacuous aura that envelops Gotham and its residents consequently produces an incredibly inconsistent pace.The initial plane siege over Uzbekistan, powered by Zimmer's monumental score, exemplified Nolan's insistence for practical effects and categorically commenced the blockbuster with excitement. Bane's introduction was memorable, with CIA agents building him up to be the most imposing terrorist ever, and cemented a visceral style for the character. Then, for the next hour, nothing happens. Plot thickening agents for Tate's fusion reactor project, corporate rival Daggett whom is funding Bane and his mercenaries, attacking Gotham Stock Exchange to bankrupt Wayne Enterprises. That's not even a third of the sub-plots! Fast forward to a brawl between Batman and Bane, acting as a test of physical strength, and the adrenaline ramps up again. Only to then rapidly diminish minutes later when Wayne is thrown into an underground prison and must endure Gotham's reckoning as Bane traps the entire police force within tunnels after exploding half of the island. Well, you get the idea. All these plots, all these strands of franchise building/closing, are haphazardly edited together by Smith. One scene includes Batman, then cuts to Kyle, then Bane, then Daggett, then Fox, then Tate, then Blake, then Gordon and then back to Batman. Nolan, simply put, cannot juggle all of these characters and plots coherently. Some, admittedly, are more interesting than others.Then we get to the conclusive act, which turns an unbalanced yet tonally somber feature into an absolute mess. Terribly executed character reveals, a complete loss of real-time, the worst death sequence to ever grace our screens and resolving a hundred million sub-plots in the space of twenty minutes. The snowy second brawl between Batman and Bane was clunky, with a fighting style that was obviously choreographed instead of inhibiting natural fluidity. The inadequacy of certain early demises essentially destroyed the thin character development that preceded, again, likening individuals to plot devices. And the essential buildup to anarchy never really resolved itself.The harshness of my critiquing is at the forefront due to the excellence this trilogy has previously provided. Make no mistake, there are meritorious attributes to The Dark Knight Rises. Hardy's body-language exuded a menacing demeanour. Bale, as Wayne, builds himself up stoically and with subtle complexions. Hathaway certainly looked the part as Catwoman, exercising her typically nice persona with a ""bad girl"" attitude. Zimmer's score, as always, delivers in the bass department, turning the most menial scenes into epic tapestries. Pfister's cinematography, especially the IMAX sequences, were beautifully shot and saturated colours enhanced the suppressed environment of Gotham.Objectively speaking, The Dark Knight Rises is a technically astute blockbuster. Narratively though? Not in the slightest. It's a mess. Borderline boring. A case of too many ingredients unable to simmer in a broth of explosive potential. Nolan completes his renowned trilogy in a dissatisfying conclusion that, unfortunately, many will not admit to being mediocre. Marking this feature as Nolan's weakest film to date, in what is a stellar filmography."
148,"I just finished seeing this movie or the second time. It is difficult to find something I liked about this movie and I am a fan o Batman and this kind of movies in general. I've seen hundreds of action movies, from 50's to today.Previous batman movies were closer to the hero. This one shows a broken batman who does not want to be batman. Suddenly he decides he wants to save the city. His loyal servant abandons him when he decides to save the city. Everything is different than the batman we know and love. This one is definitely the worst batman movie ever. Cristian Bale the worst batman. Michael Keaton was far better for the role. I didn't enjoy this movie at all. I saw it only because it was a batman movie. Too much talking and little real batman action."
149,"I have registered on IMDb just to review this title, when I saw ""Best Movie of the Year 2012"", ""Even better than the first two movies"" I think my brain just froze wondering if we actually have all seen the same movie. I am a great fan of the series, but even with a biased point of view I cannot rate this movie higher than a 5/6, and here's why.INCOHERENT Do you seriously believe that a city would send its whole police force just to follow a lead? Worse, after that they seem to spend like 2 or 3 months trapped with no way of interacting with the outside world, yet they are still perfectly in shape when going up to the surface. I don't know if you have tried to spend 2 or 3 weeks in the dark, without any clue regarding the daylight, but I can assure you that you quickly start to suffer from sleep deprivation, nervous breakdown, stress etc.THE PRISON Worst point of this movie in my opinion. First, how climbing a wall is going to make him stronger than Bane? From what I saw in the first fight, it was clearly a physical issue and not a psychological one (or at least it's what I have been given to see). Then, I felt really betrayed by the plot, they talk about this hole like the hell on earth, so I started to feel excited wondering if Bruce would have to become a bad ass beating the other prisoners to get stronger and finally more like Bane (which would have make better sense than climbing a wall, but then again it's just my opinion). When I look at the prison in the first movie, the conditions seem far worse than this hole in the desert where basically nothing happens. Finally why makes him fail two times? we know that he will eventually manage to get out, why not use this time differently? I really don't get the choices made regarding the editing. PREDICTABLE Catwoman coming back at the end of the movie, no really? Again we know that she will play a role in this movie so why treating us like ignorant by presenting a moody character who just want a clean start? Regarding her skills, I wouldn't think having problems with the justice is such a big deal (she manages to steal from Batman remember), but ho surprise she has a heart after all. It's really a shame, I really like her performance otherwise. WHERE IS BATMAN 165 minutes of movie, my only conclusion is that they could not afford a serious editor who would have had the decency of asking the production ""hey guys, is this really The Dark Knight Rises or I am in the wrong place?"" And when finally he comes out of the shadow, he gives us one of the most boring fight in the whole series (it was 1/3 of movie so we obviously knew that he was going to get beaten). I am not saying the development of Bruce Wayne was not interesting, but half an hour of mystery ""where is Bruce Wayne, where is batman"" was too much. Catwoman manages to steal from one of his safes.. read the sentence again and find the mistake, yes the Bruce Wayne who uses a tank as his car, who is worth billions, get robbed like the tenant of a candy shop. THE END I am French so obviously I am great fan of Marion Cotillard, but she's just not credible as the mean daughter who want to take over daddy's work. It escalates in 3 minutes (with an epic Friend Zone anecdote that surely have made some teens cry + a few flashbacks to compensate the lack of development regarding the characters), maybe to compensate the overall predictability of the movie, and Batman after being stabbed just remains still, you have to understand a knife is really a big deal after having fallen from 30m, been on fire (first movie) or being hardly beaten (broken back 1hr earlier). I don't care if I am surprised or not, I am batman I am being stabbed I do something, I react at least ""ouch that hurts""... Having said that, there are a few surprises which fortunately improve a bit the quality, but again I feel there was much more consistency between the first two movies. In my opinion, there are just too many holes in the plot, too many bad decisions in terms of editing, not enough Batman scenes, and not enough development regarding the supporting cast. That said, I wouldn't say that I have wasted 10 bucks, I had still a good time but it really could have been much more better. A special mention to Michael Caine who has brought - I think - so much in the 3 movies, providing an outstanding and consistent performance."
150,"I was quite sad that the movie turned out to be like it is, because I really had high hopes for it, especially after the amazing movie that The Dark Night was.I think that the movie simply has too many inconsistencies and just plain badly done scenes:1. The scientist takes about 10 seconds to fiddle with a state-of-the-art reactor and make it into a bomb. 2. They had never seen this reactor before, supposedly didn't even know it existed, yet somehow, they have a ""nuclear"" piece that fits right into it and magically turns it into a bomb... 3. How batman stays still like he can't move when he's stabbed, yet 2 minutes later everything is fine again and he's running around. 4. How when the truck with the bomb crashes, the woman who's in the front of the truck dies, yet Com. Gordon, who's in the back of the lorry, in a huge metal compartment, with no seat belt, no nothing, is just fine. Not even a scratch on him. 5. How they make people walk in ice, yet in the next scene where they show a view of the city supposedly 1-2 days later, there's no ice to be seen. 6. How when Robin goes to save the cops and tells them to come up the manhole, the cop is immediately shot. Also, if the manhole was there the whole time and it was open, why didn't the cops just escape? 7. The scene where all the cops charge up to the criminals, how come no one shoots at the running cops before they're like 50 meters from City Hall, and also, how do Bane and Batman just stand in the middle of hundreds of guys with guns and yet nobody thinks to shoot at them?Seriously, I could go on, but the truth is that at one point I could not stop realizing how many sloppy twists and events were happening on the screen, and how little attention had been given to detail. On top of this, the story becomes weak by trying to include so many different, irrelevant little things at the same time, which leaves nothing but poorly developed characters and too many scenes that add nothing to the plot...All in all, a huge disappointment. I mean, if I hadn't had such great expectations from such a good director as Nolan, then I probably would have considered it as passable, nothing to write home about. But after seeing what he was able to do with The Dark Knight, and then to see such a crappy followup, leaves me feeling disappointed and sad for what could (should) have been a great movie."
151,"This is one of my favorite bad movies ever. So many things in it don't make any sense. It's awfully written and the fact that this movie has an 8.4 shows that many people don't have a single braincell.FBI guys in plane instead of shooting attackers outside plane decide to start punching their tied-down prisoners so the movie can happen.Who are Bane's armed men in the first place and why do they blindly follow him?Gotham sends the entirety of Gotham's cops (3,000 in a city of 12 million compared to New York's 40,000 cops in a city of 8 million) into the sewers instead of smaller teams of Swat troopers or national guard and now they're trapped? And can't they just climb out of the manholes or is Bane's men guarding every manhole in the city?The cops charge Bane's men armed with machine guns and hardly any of the cops die and the next scene everyone is in a fist-fight?Why doesn't Bane detonate the bomb immediately? Why wait 6 months? Literally no reason because he intends to just blow it up regardless.Awful ending twist with Talia Al'Ghul that means nothing to anyone and leads to an unintentionally hilarious death scene.Batman's broken back fixed by a rope and a punch to it.All in all, not good."
152,"I felt compelled to submit my first IMDb review after seeing the film today and looking at the IMDb rating and some of the reviews which have been posted.Nolan has been praised for his gritty realistic portrayal of batman, yet chooses to focus this last film on a giant cartoon bomb with huge digits counting down to destruction.WOW...Social, moral and political issues are hinted at but never truly addressed, instead mind-numbing punch-ups and chases play out with inevitable conclusions."
153,"Nolan's recent blockbusters stand like looming corporate architecture: shining and cerebral; stately and sexless. His scripts are like visitors' guides to these spaces, proudly explaining every detail, surgically removing every doubt. His tell-don't-show insistence is of an artist possessing consummate technical skill and curiosity, but one unwilling to allow his crafted geometric edges to be rounded off with anything approaching satire or self-effacement. Nolan's style is rigorously formal and conservative, eliding evidence of the author in favour of ruthless aesthetic efficiency. Handsome and functional but lacking personality: Apple iPod films.His sort-of-superhero trilogy began with Batman Begins, an elegant, taut, stirring comic book thriller, in which Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) struggled with his entrenched internal fears, and how to externalise them and use them as a weapon. It was followed by The Dark Knight, which had some fantastic scenes, usually involving the Joker, and maintained a convincing sense of dread up to a point. But it was dogged by hyper-plotting, scattergun characterisation and maddening verbosity - and sadly its successor continues and extends these trends.The third film is set eight years after The Dark Knight, and we meet Wayne as a limping recluse, still suffering physically and emotionally from his sacrifice. The first hour is a spaghetti mass of new characters and reintroduced characters and references to characters, but it's pretty much the same plot as Avengers Assemble, with a bad guy (in this case Bane, played by Tom Hardy) threatening to use a powerful yet unstable energy source as a weapon of mass destruction. Bane was ""born in hell on Earth"". He's built like Lord Humungous from Mad Max 2, his gas mask looks like a Predator mouth, and he speaks like Darth Vader. Not nice. Luckily Batman has help from cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), feisty rookie cop Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and the usual wholesome oldies, Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and Alfred (Michael Caine).There's a great central scene in which Batman is lured to Bane's hideout, and the two go head-to-head, elbow-to-elbow. It's the one satisfying action scene in the film. (There's nothing to rival Begins' monorail showdown or The Dark Knight's truck chase.) Bane is still a seething, menacing presence at this point. All physicality: the embodiment of rage and fearlessness. But soon after he starts speaking at length, and his voice rises and his mystery evaporates, and he becomes just a man, much less than the horrible primeval idea he'd been before. If anyone could have done with a media spokesperson, it's Bane.The film then enters zeitgeist territory, with Bane's army tearing down Wall Street (or whatever the Gotham equivalent might be), nullifying the police presence, and staging the ultimate Occupy protest, while the meek Gotham citizens cower indoors. By this point serious questions about plot logic and group dynamics emerge - a lot of ""How did he end up there?"" and ""Why don't they just...?"" type enquiries. This is what happens when writers follow every digression their story allows.The Dark Knight Rises isn't a terrible film, but at nearly three hours the content must more compelling than this. I don't mind its neo- conservative messages; the worship of the feted elite is not new to the superhero canon. I can cope with the portentousness. Even Christian Bale's funny Batman voice doesn't bother me. These are all matters of taste. But if we're expected to take this stuff seriously then excessively exposition-heavy screen writing, narrative over-complexity in lieu of profundity, plot chasms, extraneous characterisation, and editorial indiscipline are inexcusable.Remove the cumbersome political overtones and you're left with something disappointingly generic: a doubtful hero (with attachment issues, of course) facing up to a brutish nemesis, a city in peril, and an explosive showdown. So you might as well watch Avengers Assemble again."
154,"THEY CHANGED THE ENTIRE CHARACTER OF THE VILLAIN. All of the stuff that made Bain interesting, they didn't even include in the movie. The premise was idiotic. Batman fans always except that for some reason villains want to take over Gotham City, who knows why; especially since they are stuck in the late 50's with the old cars, slum neighborhood etc. But this was just dumb. First of all they really gave no reason that this would be so in this movie, they usually give us that. Then the costume Bain wore served no purpose except to make him look scary, or in this case like Hannibal Lechter. And then the complete departure from the storyline that took us out of the country for what seemed like hours in real time, before ""the Dark Knight Rises"" which everyone knew he would, and they didn't even bother to make that interesting. What they succeeded in doing with this movie was making my butt hurt because I had been sitting waaaaay too long. So if you go see it, buy the extra large popcorn, dump a gallon of butter on it, buy a hotdog, a huge soda, lots of candy, take a cushion, because you're gonna be in there for a while, waiting for what you already know is going to happen."
155,"I've seen this movie a few times, all in the hope that multiple viewings may unearth some hidden gem I missed the first time or two. Sadly, none were to be found.I have to say that I was initially discouraged with the choice of villain for this installment. I do not follow Batman lore (canon?) so I had no idea who ""Bane"" was or why I should care. After watching this movie, I couldn't get over the thought that Bane was a mediocre criminal at best, who was only successful because the screenwriters made him that way. He didn't come off as menacing, intimidating or, well, crazy enough to make me think that he was some formidable opponent for Batman. Maybe I was spoiled after seeing the maniacal genius in Ledger's Joker, but Bane came off as very pedestrian.The scenes with Hathaway were unnecessarily long and drawn out. And so were the scenes of Batman/Wayne in the pit. This movie could have been better served by having been cut down by a good hour to get some pacing going because it never really took off. The bomb chasing / tracking sequence was interesting as was getting the police force trapped underground. The football sequence was neat, too, as there was a comic-book like feel to watching the field fall away right behind a streaking player's trail. And the ending sequence (batplane on autopilot with the nuke) was a bit formulaic but entertaining. But there was just... too... much... space... in between these parts to keep the movie from lagging. Overall, it would have been much better served to have had (1) a universally known villain (the Riddler, maybe) and (2) much better pacing."
156,Way longer than it had to be. Bale is still not good. Bad acting by levit. Only good thing about the film was Anne Hathaway. Second one was better. First and 3rd were just ok.
157,"THE REVIEW DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS REGARDING THE DARK KNIGHT RISES.As it is with every Nolan film, the film starts off with an impressive mid-air action sequence, doing justice to the proverb: ""Well Begun is Half Done"". Synonymous to the bank robbery scene, Bane enters the action with a different style clearly showing off how evil he is. The film then slowly settles down showing us what has changed in the past 8 years after Harvey Dent's death. Harvey still is considered as the ""White Knight"" and Batman as an outlaw vigilante. Bruce is weak and filled with a regret. Then the story takes shape in to the usual good-versus-evil plot in an extremely aggressive environment with a few shocking twists and a great conclusion.First of all, let's throw light on Bane. Bane is totally perfect. Tom Hardy portrays him extremely powerfully. I was impressed by the amount of dedication he took which clearly can be seen. But we cannot compare Bane with The Joker, who was spectacularly portrayed by Heath Ledger in the The Dark Knight. Bane doesn't possess the sense of humor that Joker possessed, true; but that's just because he's pure evil and wants his job done. He is true to his word and his actions. Tom Hardy is as good as Heath Ledger was.Then there's other performances to hail. After Bane I thought Alfred, played by the Michael Cain, and Billy, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, were the strongest. Alfred is more than a butler in this film, he is Bruce's guardian. There are many scenes when they both exchange emotions and a part of it was shown in the trailer where Alfred says ""I don't Want to Bury you..."". Those were seriously well filmed scenes, probably the best in the entire film. Joseph plays a cop who turns out to be another great character. After that the entire ensemble did their job well too with good acting. I had a feeling that Catwoman wasn't gonna work but I was wrong... In other superhero movies, you will find that the Hero is given the most vital spot, his sidekick a little less, the people he loves a little more less and the villain is always portrayed with exaggeration. Nolan however very perfectly places them on the same level. His films are quite natural and down-to-earth, including TDKR, which is what makes his films so special. Now moving towards the technical aspects of this film, they are brilliant as always but I did not find anything new in them. If you expect it to get better than the technical ingenious of Chris Nolan's Inception, you will be slightly disappointed. The film is actually 70% drama and 30% action. But it is worth it. If you ever get the opportunity, don't miss it on IMAX. Similar to Batman Begins, the story is quite straightforward. It does not have the beautiful complexity of The Dark Knight because it focuses more on the experience where Nolan is trying to give you that feeling of ""Rise"". The ending was quite smart but I won't say anything more than that. It totally depends on how YOU take it... In conclusion, it was a worthy ending to an amazing series. I wouldn't like to compare it to The Dark Knight as this film has it's own different story to tell. So I suggest you watch it with an open mind, making no comparisons to it's predecessor and you might enjoy it more... In case you are too excited to watch it then go to Wikipedia, they have the entire plot there ;)Visit my facebook page: www.facebook.com/filmsthemostbeautifulart"
158,"Morgan Freeman's character goes from clever to worthless. Alfred goes on and on about what's going to happen to Bruce when we know that Alfred is always right so he's practically giving the plot away. Bane could apparently do so much with no ease you become numb and unimpressed by his character. Stronger than everyone, able to hack anything, everything. Seems to know where everything is effortlessly, where the reactor is, batmans batcave, how to hack the stock market, find 100s of thugs who have no prob committing suicide when the bomb goes off, c'mon. So far fetched. So unintelligent unlike the dark knight. Colliard's character was the most unsatisfying, not to mention unconvincing twist. I could go on and on about this movie..Jesus"
159,"Interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, interminable, did I say interminable yet? What a waste of acting talent, the only bright spot was the good casting /production values which made the film tolerable to sit through but I never want to see it again although I did enjoy the first two films and have watched them several times. The directing was poor, the writing was poor, character development was poor, and the actors were not allowed to act to their potential. Scenes were drawn out, some were dead ends (long and drawn out dead ends, perhaps this was an even longer film and too much was cut out to shorten it? The film was as a dirge. Perhaps it should have been named the ""The Dark Knight Trudges On"". Only ONE moment of comedic relief and it was not original but the film was so droll the joke, any joke, was appreciated. This movie could have been standard length and been much better or much longer (with fewer dead ends) and perhaps better. Another film which was clearly done to just rake in the residual dough."
160,"After taking the fall for Harvey Dent's tragic demise multi-millionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale returns) turns into a semi-crippled recluse hiding out in his mansion, reducing his companionship to the faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine). Gotham is now a city governed by the rigid Dent Act, which has cleared the streets of crime, but overfilled the prisons. With Batman now both obsolete and wanted the war on crime is seemingly won and even the hero Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) contemplates a hard earned rest, while still troubled by the Batman's sacrifice. That is until the up-and-commance of the masked mercenary Bane (Tom Hardy voiced by Sean Connery) topples the facade and awakes Wayne's past demons. Batman reemerges - together with Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) karate high-heeling and street-cop Blake (Joseph Gordon-Lewitt) as the moral fibre of the city.The masterful ""The Dark Knight"" together with a relatively spectacular career spanning from ""Memento"", ""Batman Begins"" and ""Inception"" the Nolanite army has become a powerful force (as proved by the ridiculously high IMDb ranking of this movie). Despite apparent flaws, idiosyncrasies and an inexplicable flush of ""Batman and Robin"" reminiscent cheesy one-liners, the ending to the trilogy has garnered an astounding 8,8 rating. Much is owed to the brilliance of the previous two outings of Nolan's Batman, especially to the mind-warping villainous and already legendary Heath Ledger Joker (not toppled by the slightly bombastic and naive ending of the boat conundrum). With the whole film world in awe everyone wanted and expected the Batman trilogy to end as a masterpiece.Alas - it was not to be. Naturally the final part lacked the same captivating evil-doer as Joker and no one expected anything of the same magnitude to be possible. Although Hardy as Bane does a great job making himself a credible and deadly opponent to Batman, he lacks the same story impact (unable to carry the movie as Ledger did in his outing), which is even more diminished as he is inexcusably downgraded and lazily disposed of before the denouement. Therefore it was quite apparent that the weight of the final part of Nolan's Batman will lay strongly on the shoulders of the plot and story, which would have to outdo the already sturdy scripts in the first two outings. Unfortunately for the Nolan brothers their creative genius is vastly overrated, as they embark onto their final Batman adventure with a nonsensical script ridden with holes as vast as an exploding stadium and several iffy performances (featuring the most laughable death scene in living memory). These flaws are glossed over by the technical and narrative brilliance of Christopher Nolan, who manages to bring together a pretty looking picture with framing to die for. However instead of coherence Nolan goes for the effect factor, regardless of logical bearing (like the visually engulfing, but literally dumbfounded police squad fist fight).After giving the movie a second chance, the incessant problems instead of receding, start overflowing and expanding (instead of one sore thumb down your other thumb starts feeling numb). Essentially ""The Dark Knight Rises"" does best as a pure action flick, even though sequences are rather sparse and interlope with many dramatic sequences of varying valour. Nolan's picture is mostly dissatisfying on a cerebral level - various moral questions appear, but function mostly as superficial and purely instrumental plot points. Given Nolan's capabilities a more focused look into the morality of the Dent Act or the underpinnings of the nod to the Occupy Wall Street movement would have been very welcome. Instead Nolan offers us outtakes of cheesy superhero one-liners like ""This isn't a car"" and ventures in soapy melodrama with a side order of overcooked pathos. Not quite Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" or ""Batman and Robin"", but much closer in class to those productions than to the previous Nolan Batman movies or Tim Burtons comiccy gems."
161,"After Batman begins and The dark Knight movie I am totally disappointed by seeing this movie.this lacks drama, story and emotions that we have see in first two parts of this great 'triology'.but we will definitely remember this triology for first two parts and our favorite joker."
162,"I can't believe this is the same director...I thoroughly enjoyed the 2 previous films but this was a CrapFest.I found myself asking questions throughout the film, which is a disjointed, boring, batless flick...when he does show up, it's not very interesting...the bat, I'm afraid, has lost his touch...Ingredients for DARK KNIGHT RISES POOP MILKSHAKE>>1) Swap Wayne Water Device from the first film with a Wayne energy Atom bomb, thats pretty much the story, even with its own timer..also include explosive drains. 2) Add 2+ hours of dull exposition with 20 min of bland/repetitive action scenes. 3) Add the pointless character of Gordon Levitt, {correction}.. replace Batman/Bruce Wayne screen time with Gordon Levitt. Nolan has sold the fans short by catering to the next film in the Bat series by giving this character too much screen time. The character knows who batman is too quick and the audience is asked to make a leap of faith and just go with it.....WTF...Seriously...WTF...some sob story about seeing Bruce at an orphanage...and knowing its batman..blah blah 4) Convolute the story even more by adding in more uninteresting characters, and a last minute villain...that you could see a mile away. 5) Add the compulsory Scarecrow character into the film through a bizarre court scene. 6) Have enemies that can't shoot fully automatic weapons in a straight line. 7) Force in the ""Bane breaks Bat storyline"", then unconvincingly have Gotham under siege for 5 months. 8) Destroy Gotham Bridges or have scenes involving the Gotham Bridges. 9) Add overwhelming music to try and recover/improve bad scenes. 10) Fail to capitalise on a great baddie in Bane and a great actor in Tom Hardy by one shoting him at the end...cheap O' so Cheap... 11) Have a plot involving cops being trapped underground for 5 months...I call them Mole-cops, thats trademarked! 12) Have an atom explosion scene in the end that rivals Indiana and the poop skull. 13) Have Gotham cheering (even as the radiation cloud is blown towards Gotham).I could continue... but I'm so underwhelmed, I have to try and remember to breath."
163,"Since the cinematic genius of The Dark Knight, I've been eagerly awaiting the final instalment. In this review, I will be comparing The Dark Knight Rises to its prequel, given that the hype has been created by the brilliance of its predecessor. From the start and throughout, the film just didn't work. I couldn't get into this film whatsoever. Perhaps it was a combination of a lousy script, including poor dialogue and an outrageous plot that seemed rushed together; completely out of tone to the simplistic but intelligent, and most importantly, realistic plots we've seen in the first two of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. **SPOILERS**Firstly, the plot was ridiculous. Take a step back and view what actually happened in this movie. A man with an atomic bomb trying to blow up the city he spent months 'cleansing'. As opposed to a man hell bent on showing the city that when push comes to shove, they'd eat each other alive. On the face of it, which sounds like a master-class, the one with substance and logic? That's what used to distinguish this Batman from Superhero films.The dialogue was a mess. I challenge you to find a single quote that had any worthwhile meaning to it when compared with great lines like ""Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now"" and ""You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain"" and that's leaving out all of the Joker's classic quotes. PS ""I'm Gotham's reckoning"" isn't a meaningful quote.They ruined Batman. Batman is supposed to be a hero that never gives up. In this film, we are told he gave up for 8 years because of a girl, and at the end of the film he retired for a girl again. It wasn't just the ideology of Batman that was trashed in the film. He is supposed to be a fighter who thinks on his feet and utilises all his gadgets and weapons, whereas, in this movie he was nothing but a mad brawler. Disgraceful. Let's compare the opening scenes to show how out of proportion and wild Nolan has made this film. In the Dark Knight, it opens with The Joker raiding a bank, killing off his accomplices and escaping in an organised fashion. Whereas, we see Bane tearing up a plane with another plane, whilst placing a dead body and taking blood; unexplained and just unrealistic.The actors performed well, but the characters were poorly scripted. Alfred was ruined by and overuse of crocodile tears. Gordon's character was a complete mess, even cringe worthy at times. Catwoman was good, but seemed like she was conveniently thrown in whenever it suited. Miranda was perhaps the weakest link. Overall, I could not relate to them or become emotive to their dire situation.Nolan's idea to connect the film to Batman Begins was ultimately a failure, and even ruined Bane's character as a result.Moving on to the numerous flaws in the story:We learn that Bruce Wayne has serious injuries, including no cartilage in both knees. He would have been in excruciating pain from every movement if this was the case, let alone get back in the suit.This one was perhaps the most unrealistic. Batman had his back broken, his vertebrate was sticking out. Yet somehow, a man punched his spine back into place. How he managed to become 'un-crippled' and later defeat Bane in a fist fight is insane. Why didn't he just shoot Bane? His head was exposed at all times. Earlier, we saw Batman use projectiles to knock out his men so why did he not use that on Bane? From escaping the random prison in a faraway place (nonsense), Bruce Wayne managed to get back to Gotham in time and find Selina Kyle on the streets. How?You know it's going to be a Blockbuster drag when the main threat in the film is the unoriginal nuclear bomb. And this was no exception. This bomb didn't even make sense too! The Doctor estimated it would be 5 months until the bomb explodes, yet it had a precise timer on it, despite them being able to blow it up at any given point. How did Batman escape the explosion when he was seen in the aircraft just 5 seconds before it detonated? Surely, the radiation emitted would have critically mutated the citizens of Gotham regardless of the blast radius.To summarise, The Dark Knight Rises was not only garbage, it ruined everything that made the first two films brilliant. There wasn't a sense of realism or intelligence. I can only imagine the majority of users who have given this film parity with its predecessor, have fallen for the hype and forgotten everything that made The Dark Knight a magnificent spectacle."
164,"This is probably a totally different kind of review, but it does have to do with the movie, so I'll just get started.You know, I've been writing this book and at a point when I was stuck and needed inspiration I decided to watch this movie, hoping it would inspire me so I could connect the dots in my story line. I have a plot, but all the pieces don't fit together. It's been incredibly important to me to make sure that anything that happens in my book doesn't just pop out of the blue; that it's explainable and the audience can understand why it's happening or how it got to that point.When I was watching this movie, it was the first time I really paid attention to the plot....and realized that it's FULL of loopholes! For instance, how does Robin - just by looking at canisters full of explosives - realize exactly what Bane is trying to do with them? That certainly wasn't explained. Yet it gets an 8.8 rating on IMDb? How did that happen? Now I'm confused on how this movie got such a great rating with a plot that's full of unexplained gaps."
165,"This review is spoiler free. There are so few films that conclude a story right. The very few I can think of are The Return of the King, Toy Story 3, Back to the Future Part 3, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Return of the Jedi. I am very glad to add The Dark Knight Rises to the list. The reason the final Harry Potter film is not on that list, is because after watching both parts of the final film in a row, they feel uneven when viewed together and the second part grows weak after multiple viewings. The Dark Knight Rises is what the final Potter should have been like. I usually try not to get too excited for a film. In this day and age, a movie theater is mostly full of disappointment. But this was different. I am a Batman fanatic. I always loved him as a kid and Batman Begins opened up a whole new world for me to dwell in. He is my favorite fictional hero of all time. So after four years of waiting for this, I am so happy that this truly is the ending this series deserved. I am not going to reveal plot details. Like most of Christopher Nolan's films, the less you know going in, the better. Like Nolan's other films, the cast is fantastic. Christian Bale gives his best performance of the series as Bruce Wayne and Batman. Michael Caine returns as Alfred, who will break your heart in one scene. Gary Oldman is still great as Commissioner Gordon, who has had an excellent character arc in this series. The new characters are all awesome. Tom Hardy as Bane is one of the best villain performances I've seen in a long time. His master plan made my jaw drop. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays John Blake, one of the few good cops left in Gotham. Marion Cotillard does well as supporting character, Miranda Tate. She is not given a lot of screen time, but she is definitely not a throw away character. My favorite of the newcomers is Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. She is perfect in this role. I thought she really did the character justice and I think she's the best on screen Catwoman yet. The technical aspects of the film are flawless, like the previous two films. The cinematography is incredible. If you can, see this film in IMAX. There is about an hour of the film in the format and it looks stunning. The action is spectacular and never overdone. The visual effects are truly incredible. I am so glad that Christopher Nolan prefers practical effects over CGI. The opening sequence is perhaps one of the most exciting stunts ever put on film. And the fact that they really did it, is amazing. Hans Zimmer's score is beautiful and really adds that extra level of excitement to the film. Even though James Newton Howard doesn't contribute to the score for this film, Zimmer has proved to be a really talented composer.I think Christopher Nolan made the right choice to tell his Batman story in three parts. Looking back on the first two films after seeing this, it really is a solid beginning, middle and end. After seeing the Dark Knight, as much as I wanted to see a finale to the story, I was so unsure of how they could possibly end these films right. Luckily, Nolan is one of the best directors today and he has certainly given us an ending of epic proportions. It's the best film series since The Lord of the Rings. The Dark Knight Rises is not just another summer movie. It is an event and you should definitely take part in it. I doubt we will see anything this spectacular in film for a long time."
166,"I loved the first two Batmans because he was Batman, but this one was such a let down! There wasn't one moment where the audience or anyone in the movie was like ""wow thats Batman!"". I kept thinking: ""after this scene they are really going to make him come back"" and then, ""oh after this scene we are really going to see Batman!"". Never happened. I am pretty sure if I had counted he probably only put the suit on five times the whole movie and they tore him down never to bring him back up in any real Batman capacity. Basically the entire movie was him getting his you know what kicked. And the end was left open too. I am so disappointed."
167,"So Let's see, The Conclusion to Chris Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Starting with Batman Begins which was a great movie that pioneered the new wave of superhero films with blockbuster action and near art house philosophy with superheroes at the center. It took the concept of fear and turning it into power. Then came what is considered Nolan's greatest work, The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight brought in an engaging villain, ideas of anarchy vs control, real tragedy and analysis on what it takes to turn a hero to the dark side. Then came this movie...Well I personally don't care for it. It's long and pretentious and has loads of laughable moments. Bruce Wayne is written to be a little annoying and out of character. There are GAPING plot holes, nonsensical writing and odd creative decisions.First, what I like about the movie: Bane and Cat-woman. Bane is great. Tom Hardy is a great actor. He can be just a little hard to understand at times but did a great job nonetheless with an intelligent yet intimidating portrayal. That said, the character he played was Bane, in name only. No characteristics were taken from the comics otherwise. Cat-woman is great and that's all I can say. Her scenes are the most fun to watch in the movie.So where did the movie go wrong? Well, it has a lot to say but never takes the time to say it. It's also over 2 and a half hours long, which I don't usually mind but the editing and pacing are very hectic. It never takes the time to examine it's characters. Batman is a whiny recluse now and that character change plays no real part in the story later. The Batman voice is even more annoying in this one. The plot of the Dark Knight is made completely useless. They could have skipped that movie and gone to this one and everything would have been fine. the only remnant is Bruce Wayne's trauma (which goes NOWHERE) and the Dent act which caused peace (which goes NOWHERE). Things they could have cut out of the movie to save time since they clearly lengthened the movie ad cut bits and pieces everywhere.Bane has an overly complicated plan that involves (yet is not limited to) stealing Bruce Wayne's fingerprints, bankrupting him, breaking batman and throwing him into prison, destroying the city for the next 5 months, taking over the city and revealing the lies of commissioner Gordan, using tech from Wayne industries to break open black gate prison, then nuking the city. In that exact order. Why not just break Batman then nuke the city?Some Questions: If Bane has Bruce's fingerprints why is he stealing his tech? And why bankrupt him if you're just going to throw him in a pit and take over the city anyway? What is Bane's motivation really? He says the criminals are oppressed by the government but never explains how. His MO keeps changing though out the movie really Why is he attacking Gotham and claiming it needs to be saved like this when the first 30 minutes established Gotham is perfectly fine and at ""peace time""? If you're going to say because the commissioner lied about Two-face you'd be wrong because the league of shadows has no problem with lying and deceit to gain power (evidenced by Batman Begins and this movie). Why put Batman, WORLDS GREATEST DETECTIVE, in a prison A CHILD once escaped from? Why keep him alive anyway? The entire ""your punishment must be more severe"" line has no logic in it. The league of shadows kills its enemies but now it just keeps the most dangerous ones alive?Talia al Ghul appears. I have issues with this. Why do her and Bruce Suddenly start having sex completely out of nowhere when they've JUST met? she says she hated her father for banishing Bane but still wants to carry out his plan. WHY? Why send EVERY policeman in Gotham to fight Bane in the sewers? couldn't they have gassed the sewer instead or kept some officers on the surface?Aside from those questions, there is really no chemistry between Bruce and Talia or Batman and Cat-woman or Bane and Talia. These romances happen without any prior indication and just confused me.It's not very faithful to the comics, but Nolan never wanted it to be anyway. I don't mind that and the other 2 movies did it pretty well, but in this case it's so far from the comics that there's no reason for this to be a Batman film. NONE. Other than the costumes. Where is the detective work? Where is the use of intelligence? Where is the dark atmosphere? most of this movie happens in the day time. Where's the noir feel that Batman is known for? Bane is nothing like this in the comics and for that matter neither is Talia.But I'd let that slide if the plot made logical sense. Bane's and Talia's deaths are both completely lackluster scenes. The ending was predictable and foreshadowed heavily by both Lucius Fox and Alfred. And speaking of the ending... BATMAN DOESN'T QUIT!!!!! WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THAT ABOUT? ONE OF THE MAIN FOCUSES OF THE COMICS IS BATMAN'S OBSESSION WITH CRIME AND HOW IT CONSUMES HIS LIFE!! HE STAYS BATMAN TILL OLD AGE. It might sound nit- picky but it's a major trait that batman has.There's just so much wrong with this movie. It has great scenes but they don't make sense in terms of the over-all film. Things aren't really explained very well either. to each their own I guess. This was not for me."
168,Dark Knight Rises is a tale of two movies. The first half is engaging and Cat Woman is stupid hot. They also introduce an interesting Character in Gordon-Levitt. Then the movie looses itself. The story falls so flat I don't even think the actors can get behind the on-the-nose writing and terrible character development. It becomes hard to watch at times. Get ready to cringe at all the clichés you see coming a mile away. The Villain is awful. The choreography brings nothing new to the table. The Gordon-Levitt characters story line in the second half is so under-written that it makes for some of the worst scenes in the movie. All brought together with the most ridiculous ending imaginable.
169,"What a disappointment this movie turned out to be. First it is over 2 hours and 30 minutes long. Batman doesn't even show up in the first 45 minutes. It was too drawn out and so much stuff in it had me asking why. Also the bad guy is someone named Bane. If you don't know anything about the comics like me, Bane made no sense. Little was explained about him, did he have super human powers? It seemed like he had extra strength but the guy that played him wasn't in hulk type shape. The body type didn't go with the character. Then catwoman gets thrown in. Why, she steels some stuff and some how has contact with Bane. And Bruce Wayne is so torn up, he can't do anything in the beginning. Batman hardly does anything. And at one point Bane captures Batman, how does he get him to some desert country to put him in a pit prison, then how does Wayne get back to Gotham. It made no sense.FINAL VERDICT: There's not anything about this movie that would warrant a recommendation. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it."
170,"I was looking forward to this. Unfortunately, my two buddies and I left the theatre quite disappointed. The plot was weak and full of holes and often as unintelligible as the villain. I appreciate that the actor was supposed to be speaking through a mask, but one really has to strain to hear what he was saying. It was too long, by at least 30 minutes. The conclusion and wrap up were lazy. I felt like I was being treated like an idiot fan-boy. The special effects and cinematography were superlative. Granted. But one has to assume that will be on the screen for a bloated blockbuster like this. We, the audience, deserve better and we deserve more. Batman deserves better! Ultimately, it's just another stupid movie, but some folks get so caught up in this fluff - a movie very few will care or be talking about six months from now. That's my opinion. And I'm not alone."
171,"I consider myself a huge fan of comic book movies. They're basically character studies with huge budgets and great special effects. I have to admit I'm not the hugest fan of Nolan's trilogy. For a movie that's supposed to be so serious and realistic the movies stop to have really dumb unrealistic moments for the sake of being ""epic"". Not to mention whenever Nolan writes dialogue for the mystique or mythos of Batman it's ALWAYS corny. He writes such great dialogue for his villains but anytime he tries to write for Batman or people talking about the idea of Batman it gets super cheesy *SPOILERS*****. The result we have here is basically Nolan sleepwalking through the movie with poor dialogue, plot inconsistencies, character motivations that aren't clear, poor fight choreography, and probably the worst ending I've ever seen in a superhero movie or a Nolan film in general.To get the good out of the way.... Ummm I honestly have nothing good to say about this movie. All the pieces are here to make a great movie. I can see why people love this movie, because it's basically a copy of The Dark Knight. Everything good gets undercut by the end of the movie. Tom Hardy as Bane turns in a great menacing performance that is worthy being held up to next to the Joker. He almost saves the film just like Heath Ledger did with the first sequel except towards the end of the movie he is totally underused and undercut. But all of his scenes where good or at least set up well. There's also two cameos that where great and really pumped me up for the rest of the movie that I won't spoil. I could say the movies greatest strength and crutch is that it ties so well into the first movie, but that also slows the movie down and makes it trip over it's own feet several times. The Score is solid if a little repetitive and the movie looks great at points.Now to the bad. This movie is so slow. I'm not going to say boring because that's subjective, but even people who loved the movie can attest to the fact that this movie's pacing is a big problem. What's more is the story pacing which takes it's time inching along until the final act which just breezes by important details leaving anyone besides the core fan base cold and unsatisfied. The editing is horrific and I don't know if I can blame the editor or Nolan's top heavy script which just like the last movie brings in the overly complicated story. The problem with such a convoluted narrative is that in order to get people to know what's going on the audience gets their hand held through scenes as actors have to constantly repeat what we're supposed to take away from the scene, which makes the movie predictable. I knew the ending to every single scene either from knowing the way it mirrored a scene earlier in the trilogy or just the way it's telegraphed. The acting isn't very good either aside from Bane who ironically gets more expressiveness out of his face when it's mostly covered up. All these actors are normally great but they're literally given only one expression. All the characters are one note throughout the whole movie there is no real character progression. The ending is stupid in so many ways i won't get into and this is just an unpleasant experience for anyone who isn't already loving the movie walking in.Now to hit some personal points I think Nolan is a good director who gets a lot of credit for using a very specific bag of tricks and makes crowd pleaser's that function as thought provoking movies. Much like Tarantino once you see the formula a lot of the magic is gone. Nolan is no David Fincher or Sam Mendes. He doesn't have the teeth to end a movie in a dark way everything always works out in the end and it's frustrating. *****SPOILERS***** The last act is probably more boring because there's no sense of tension. I knew from the beginning no main characters where going to die because Nolan is so soft. If I had to give the last harry potter movies credit they killed off a lot of the main cast so there was a genuine sense of not knowing whose going to make it. Another problem is that this is the most indulgent movie I've seen this year. There is no reason this movie needed to be so long. It pretends to be some great thoughtful movie, but it's not. There are so many themes in this movie that are too obvious or don't come into play into the movies ending. Not to mention the themes in this movie heavily contradict the ones in the previous movies. This is a really dumb movie pretending to be a smart thoughtful one. There are so many moments that are exaggerated to a ridiculous level to be ""epic"" that made me roll my eyes, this is on a Spiderman 3 level of trilogy ending.I'm giving this 4 stars because the average movie audience isn't going to care about story structure and not look as deep into it as some cinephiles may. It's a very polarizing movie, but it's really insulting at times and the more I think about it the more I dislike it. I'm really worried that superman might be 3 hours long now."
172,"Sacrificed Man City v Spurs to watch this rubbish because the IMDB rating was so good.... This is my first review, and the disappointment compelled me to leave my take. Weak characters, weak plot relying on a star studded cast to get it through, I must admit I only watched an hour but honestly couldn't take any more.... Just to add to.... the continual background music does nothing for the film. It's the only one of the trilogy I have watched and defo won't be watching the other two. I grew up with Batman in the 70's and also watched the earlier films in the franchise so it's not as if I'm not a Batman fan because I was 👎🏻"
173,"This was a decent movie, however it was not the best movie of 2012, or the summer. The drama was strained at times, and the movie was excessively long. Long for no reason. Fans of Nolan's work will like this end to what was a good stretch for Nolan's trilogy, however I'm not sure how comic book fans will respond to this last story-line. Christian Bale and Morgan Freeman were good as always. Tom Hardy was good but he was no where as good as Heath Ledger. Anne Hathaway did not change my view that she was not a good choice for this role. Sir Michael Cain is a great actor, he did what he could with what was given to him. The action was good but the movie drags terribly at times. Again, it's a decent movie, better than many that have been released so far. Many people have been trying to compare it to the Avengers or The Amazing Spiderman, it should never be compared to these two movies. The drama in Spiderman was better, the story moved more fluid. The Avengers is still, to date, the best comic book based movie and The Dark Knight is still the best of Nolan's version of Batman."
174,"Loved the first 2 instalments, so had high hopes for the third (and supposedly) final film.In its own way it's a passable film, but there are way too many plot holes to make this film stand up to its predecessors.##Spoilers ahead## If you're watching this film for 'Batman', then think again. Throughout much of the film, Wayne is either virtually crippled, beaten or away from Gotham.In many ways the film is unbelievable (I know it's a comic book story, but there needs to be some element of believability)...........consider: 1) Wayne is shown through much of the first half as being crippled - a fact backed up by a Doctors examination...........knee cartilege gone, kidneys damaged etc. etc (in other words, Wayne is a physical wreck).Yet within seconds of this diagnosis, he's seen abseiling out of a hospital window to see Gordon.And when he gets back to the 'Bat Cave', a simple attachment to his knee seems to miraculously cure all his problems.2) Wayne is bankrupted by the Stock Exchange robbery, where Bane uses Waynes fingerprints to carry out some bad dealing.Surely these transactions would have been nullified, given they were executed during a raid - yet Wayne is left penniless.3) Despite stealing his pearls and betraying him, Wayne (for some reason) forgives Anne Hathaways character.4) Wayne being thrown into the 'deep dark pit', that seems to be constantly lit by sunlight.He essentially has a broken back, that's miraculously cured by being hoisted up by ropes and punched in the back lol.Then despite his bad knee and other physical problems, he starts on the 'Rocky 4' routine - pushups, pullups and other physical exercise..............culminating in him climbing out of the pit and jumping from ledge to ledge DESPITE his knee being useless.Then for some reason he throws a rope back down - why ?? To allow the other prisoners to escape ?? And to top it all, from this unidentified country, where he has no money or passport, he manages to get back to Gotham, enter Gotham (despite there only being one bridge) and basically walk round unmolested.There are far too many other inconsistencies to even list - many of which you'll see if you watch. ALL of Gothams police force trapped in the sewers, the reactor core cum bomb that has a built in timer..........the fact Wayne sleeps with the Master Villain lol.But the bad points about the film don't stop there: 1) Bane and Batman are almost incomprehensible at times - gravelly or distorted voices against loud music or action scenes.2) 'Robin' being revealed as a police detective - presumably this leaves the franchise open for another instalment if the studio decides to make one.3) Wayne (despite being a physical wreck) is seemingly capable of overcoming anything - even being stabbed a few times towards the end of the film.Despite this, the film's still worth watching - if you can find a cheap copy in a few months time, or wait for it be shown on TV.But compared to the previous 2, this one just comes across as a clichéd mess."
175,"I am a huge fan of batman director Christopher Nolan. He is the genius who brought us such groundbreaking films as Memento and Inception, the very good Batman Begins and the excellent The Dark Night.That's why my hopes for this third installment were so high. Boy was i disappointed. This movie is a GRAND MESS. Here are some of the reasons why:Nolan cuts off batman's balls and holds them hostage the entire movie. He is either hobbling around as Bruce Wayne looking like he belongs in a Senior's Home or in his batman's suit trading punches like an aged boxer with MS. No great fight scenes in the inimitable batman style with the whooshing and swooshing and swooping and gadgets and disappearances/reappearances. I would conjecture that this is both because of the post modern philosophy adopted that no man is a true hero (including batman) and also more practically because the fight team was actually changed from the first two movies to a new one for this film, a change drastically for the worse. They should have stuck to the Keysi Fighting Method.Another error is that any movie is only as good as its villain and Bane is a horrible villain. He's really more like a big goon that the main villain usually sends in the eleventh hour to do his bidding like the big Russian guy in the Punisher for example. Don't expect another performance like Ledger's Joker here. What really gets me though, is how the second film developed the whole origin of Twoface as Harvey Dent (who was a great character) and then just dropped it and brought in a much worse villain???? Extremely irritating was Nolan superimposing the Inception style of for example heavy background music etc on this film where it doesn't belong. Even the dialogue was hard to always pick out, especially when you have two of the main characters growling through masks and the war drums right beneath their voices.But it didn't stop there. Nolan invited almost the entire Inception cast and stuck them into this film inflating the story by giving them non- essential roles and by constantly taking you out of the illusion of reality a film is supposed to create when it forces another much better film to come to mind. He and his buds must have been having such a good time on set enjoying the Inception reunion that they must have forgot they were filming an entirely different movie.The cherry on the top of this egregious casting is when in the middle of the film you suddenly have a cameo by none other than Cilian Murphy the scarecrow villain in the first Batman movie as some minor people elected judge. (And yes, you guessed it, he was also in Inception). To me that's tantamount to giving Heath Ledger (Joker) or Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Dent) a role as a cop or a waiter in this film. Seriously man, is there anything else you can do wrong to break the movie spell and keep reminding me i'm only watching a film with actors- something totally fake?I wish i could stop here but honestly i could go on and on. The movie spends time with characters whose story lines are not that interesting and leads up to a cliché climax that you and i have seen done in previous TV shows like 24 and other films.I believe the production suffered from the all too common problem of having too large a budget (250 million) that enabled Nolan to create a spectacle of ""Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing"" instead of an interesting film. The film alternates between dragging with boring exposition and blasting your ears off with nonsense. There is a tender moment between Bruce and Alfred that is very brief that was nice though ;)....Guys, I went into the theatre ready to love this film, willing to try to like it, but it never even gave me the chance. Unfortunately it does not live up to the hype. Like the Godfather Part 3, there is no reason to watch it even though you enjoyed the great Parts 1 and 2.Let sleeping dogs lie and let dead films die. For your own sake, do not break the caution tape to watch this wretched bomb of a film."
176,"One star for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's fresh and believable take on the rookie cop with street smarts, ideals and courage.One star for Anne Hathaway's purr-fect performance as the Catwoman.One star for an aging Michael Caine, in memory of the man who was a king.Beyond that, it's all a murky sea of meaningless explosions, sodden speeches, missed opportunities, and plot holes you could drive the Batmobile through.Some lowlights include . . .A super villain who mumbles so much he might just as well have a sock in his mouth. And speaking of laundry, why can't Bane afford an undershirt? A doctor who explains in clinical detail, with X-rays, exactly why Bruce Wayne can't fight anymore. Just so his fight scenes will feel even more fake than they already did.A pointless half hour in a phony-looking prison in some make believe foreign country where guys walk around all day clapping and chanting. Cool Hand Luke, this ain't. I really didn't care if Bruce Wayne climbed out of that stupid hole with a rope -- but then, the guards didn't seem to care much either. (""Climbin' out of here, boss!"" ""Yeah, Bruce, climb on out of there."") All I wanted was for Bruce to ""prove"" himself by eating fifty eggs, like in the Paul Newman classic. And at the end he could send the boys a postcard of him back in Gotham City, wearing a custom-made suit, with his arms around Miranda and Selena Kyle. And the card could just say, ""Boys, playing it cool -- Bruce.""A staggering total of 3000 cops trapped in a sewer for three months -- yet they all emerge in clean uniforms, in good health, ready to beat Bane's minions in a good old-fashioned street brawl. And even that was more exciting than watching Bane and Batman go one-on-one. This movie could have been twice as good and half as long, with one tenth of the money spent. All it takes is imagination, courage, and respect for the audience."
177,"Not sure what they saw in the screenplay to actually go ahead with this film! Not a particularly compelling plot at all, and most sections just drag and drag on with no pay off. Doesn't really end on much of a note.Standard Nolan film, really. Weak characters, cute time puzzles, decent cinematography and unintelligible sound/dialog mix."
178,"What a mess. This is one of Nolan's weakest movies and definitely the worst in the Batman trilogy.I didn't expect much from the trailer, but it was even worse than I thought. It's not terrible, but it's not a good film either.The characters were uninteresting, plot was a mess, lots of useless fighting scenes. Tom Hardy's talent was wasted and Bane character isn't even 1% as strong or as interesting as the Joker. Most of all I liked Michael Caine's performance, but that was brief and the editor rushed his few scenes too.Oh, and the movie is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long. Did they really need 3 hours to tell this mess???"
179,"I had no real expectations for this movie but never thought it would be that bad. The tone is sort of alright, but the pacing is terrible, not to mention it just didn't had to be that long. Acting is mediocre at best and the action scenes are unimaginative. Compared to the other two movies its just crap.I believe when it comes to superhero movies in Hollywood they are just generally getting the whole picture wrong. And its especially tricky in the case of Batman since he is also a unique animal"" among all the DC and Marvel superheroes since he doesn't have any kind of superpower.You know there is a difference being Batman and a guy wearing a bat costume. There must be a reason why a character dresses like idiot"". In the comics and cartoons Batman is intimidating and turns out to be an extremely clever guy, always planning ahead and bringing interesting moral questions into the equasion while Bruce Wayne is like any other generic person. Here Christian Bale is a guy wearing a bat costume and this time there is no Heath Ledger to save the movie. Don't get me wrong its not just the actor's fault, creating a perfect Batman requires the cooperation of the director, the writers etc...Apart from that there are many problems with the movie bu I don't feel the need to list them on a wall of text."
180,"It takes over one-hour in this overly long miserable film to establish the plot-another terrorist campaign against the city of Gotham and its residents. The flashbacks relating to medieval times are of absolutely no value here.The one redeeming item in this otherwise awful film is the performance by veteran actor Michael Caine, as Bruce Wayne's faithful servant Alfred. He knows when it is time to go; he is dramatic when he has to be and he certainly knew when to pour on the tears.Anne Hathaway presents an interesting but conflicting character here. She is a jewel thief, cunning, vicious and the ultimate lover for Bruce Wayne."
181,"Christopher Nolan's new film fails in terms of plot and directing.It has great visuals but it remains just a action movie, nothing more.It's not like Dark Knight anymore, a movie that makes u connect with it and feel the situations.This one is just an action packed movie nothing more. Bane's performance is not good enough ! sometimes u can't even understand what he's saying through his microphone, Heath Ledger killed it with Joker but Tom Hardy fails to create a character for Bane.the film won't even let it's own actors to feel their situations.because there is a short scene and then the next one starts, a very fast paced movie that doesn't live up to the standards of dark knight or other Nolan works.I think this must be one of his worst movies to date."
182,"Must be something about the bat-signal that causes people to up-rate blindly. This is over-produced, over-storied, and over-acted. Bale is wooden, the Bane character is stupid, the all-fists action is lame... it goes on.I watched this followed by ""Bloodshot"" (2020). The latter, at a 5.7 rating, is a much better film. Choose it instead."
183,"After All These Years This Film had potential it's just that all the Negatives I have with it just weighs it all down for me. And so with that said we'll start with the Positives. It's so nice to finally have the Batcave in the Nolen Batman Films. Then the Next is some may have Problems with the Nolen Bane I however don't oh sure at times I can't Hear what's he's saying. But all in all this Bane is really good in my opinion. And I still like how Christen Bale was still able to use one Voice for his Batman Voice and another for his Bruce Wayne Voice, I guess that's not just for this film but for all three Nolen Batman Films. The Next I like how the Tone of it still Matches the other two Nolen Batman Films. And the Last is that I like how Batman had a Much Tougher time in this film for reasons it makes a lot more interesting story telling, and I'm not just talking about in climax fight either.And On to the Negatives, the first hands down is Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, and Catwoman. For she was a horrible catwoman Salina Kyle, for me personally I think that Michelle Pfeiffer made a Lot Better Catwoman Salina Kyle in Batman Returns. And as such I feel the Party scene with Salina Kyle in Batman Returns had more of an Impact and Contributes more to the Movie as a whole, and all around much better for me personally. And no offence to the Actress maybe she wasn't given much to work with I truly hope she isn't a Terrible Actress with a Bases for comparison but aside from her introduction in to the film I found her version of Salina Kyle really Annoying and Really Unlikable for me personally. But as Max Shreck would probably In But The Plus Colum I loved the fact that the Goggles that she wears really Cleverly Designed to look like Cat Ears when it's on top her head. And that's about all of the Positive things I could say about her Sadly, her acting really isn't for me. And Speaking of acting and Characters feel the same for Marion Cotillard Betrayal of Talia al Ghul or Mranda in this film. I feel that Lexa Doig did a Lot Better Job as Talia al Ghul, to start off I just feel Marion just simply didn't look like Talia but also she doesn't feel like Talia, and not only that she doesn't really look like she could Dodge Bullets or Kicks or Sward Swipes. Her version doesn't look like she could even Dodge a Pillow flaying at her. How the good news is the only other part that I've seen her from I actually thought she did a decent Job at it, but as for Talia al Ghul, it takes more than having a Bang over the actress's eye and having her play some one with a Bad Attitude to make a Convincing Talia, she has to look like she could Dodge anything. She made a decent Mal from Inception but as for Talia al Ghul....not so much. And the so call Caged Fight Scene was way to quit so much so it felt Either Unfinished or either a Deleted Scene or an Extended Scene. In the BTS the Director Christopher Nolen clams it's meant to feel like a MMA Fight or something. First of all I'm not Criticizing his Directing or anything like that Love his movies but his Choice with this one I'm Afraid I'm going have to but just with this one. I think he sort of forgot take in account that In MMA Fights you have the Cheering and Booing of the Crowd and the Color Commentators, Wrestling Comparison since neve r seen a MMA Fight in my whole life. And the Final Thing is the Ending just Felt Rushed Especially the final scene of the film before the fade out.In Conclusion after giving it possibly my Last Chance not too long ago after PVRing it off of the TV and Quitting Less than Half way through the Party Scene to be Exact. Sadly I can't really see myself rebuying it since I bought it once before years ago but tossed it since I ended up not enjoying it after only about two watch throughs. Sadly at least not for the foreseeable future."
184,"I had to stop watching this movie about 2/3rds of the way through it. I don't understand why people liked it so much. I found it to be poorly written and poorly acted. I thought Christian Bale's performance was weak and found the dialog to be pedantic and predictable.The character of Bane would be interesting except for the pathetic description of his 'creation.' The 'toys' were pretty good, but that's far beneath what this movie could and should have been. I have enjoyed all (or most) of the other Batman movies but honestly found this one to be unwatchable. I'm astounded by the good rating here because I usually agree with user reviews on IMDb. Live and learn."
185,"This story has nothing to do with Batman. Batman is not about action-packed large scale wars, where he is just one of several heroes. Batman should be a one man show in a smaller context. In this way, instead, the existential drama typical of Batman is sacrificed in favor of too many distracting elements. The movie starts slowly, trying to develop a story from the ending of the previous installment, but it's not that compelling. Neither Bane is that interesting as an enemy, at the end of the day he's just the same old anarchist tyrant menacing the masses. The exotic setting of the central part of the movie is redundant, it would have been better to leave the asiatic setting of the first movie alone. On the other hand, the ending is good and the Hathaway character is also. Overall, the movie tries to reach an extent that's too much for a Batman story."
186,"I really liked the first two. I did. It was clear from the first gratuitous, plot-crushing soliloquy of Michael Cane (there were four in total) that this was headed for disaster: a disaster that even Anne Hathaway in black latex couldn't save. There was unintelligible dialogue from everyone, especially Gary Oldman; Bane never had a chance to be understood, with that auto-tune mask set to 'distort' on his face. People around me were constantly asking, ""what did he say?"" What little action and Bat-gadgetry there was just couldn't save this bloated failure. The names 'Waterworld' and 'Indiana Jones 4' will justifiably be raised in comparison. I really liked the first two. I did."
187,"I bought the DVD in good expectations, as I was really impressed by Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. To say the least, I want my money back. It's impossible to enjoy the movie unless you really have severe attention problems. Nothing gets properly introduced or explained. Characters come and go. What really put the nail were these things: 1. Robin drives a bus with10 kids like a hero and fails like a retard. What? 10 kids or so? What the... 2. Let us solve our issues on ice. And, oh, I quickly took a few tons of gas to draw a bat on the bridge and poured some to light it up in a convenient path from wherever you conveniently drop the torch, AND ALL THAT WHILE WE'RE ALL ON ICE IN A SECOND. 3. Wat? Things just not get explained. Inception much? I thought this was Batman. He ended up being a puss."
188,"(spoilers) The only redeeming quality of this movie was the character Bane, who had some interesting dialog, though hard to hear at times, and some well done fight scenes. But everything about Bane is undermined by the introduction of a last minute arch villain turning Bane into a glorified lackey. The last movies in the series tried to hold on to reality giving them extra tension. This movie abandons reality at every turn. Broken back, no problem just just punch it a few times and do some push ups; No money, who needs it just hitch a ride from another country and get back to the other side of the world with no funds, no identification, and no hope get there on faith. One of the biggest problems to the movie is the character Miranda Tait(aka Tila Al Gual) The film purposefully goes out of the way to give her importance and through in a contrived romance just for the sake of having her ""twist"" betrayal at the end any amount of significance. Was anyone actual shocked that she stabbed him in the back, they where setting it up the whole movie. I could go on but it might get a little mean. Next piece of contrived garbage was the character Blake( aka Robin). the hole ""I just looked in your eyes and I knew"" crap was the weakest piece of nonsense I ever heard. What is more frustrating is that Nolan had a perfect set up from Batman Begins. Blake could have been the kid Batman saved with Rachel at the end of the first movie. Wouldn't it be better if Blake had said,""oh I was on the Roof when that one chick called you Bruce and I put two and two together"" verse the crappy ""I just knew line"" absolutely weak film making. Not to mention the dialog was weaker the characters completely undermine who they were in previous films. Alfred had always been supportive, albeit sarcastic, about helping Bruce, but know he is a blubbering baby crying about Batman stopping and abandoning him to his fate and then cries again when he thinks his dead. Maybe if you stuck around to help him he would have had a better chance. Stupid writing. The lazy where going to blow up the city cliché is used instead of the themes like fear, of Batman Begins, and Chaos, of Dark Knight. No the themes are abandoned for a bomb in the city. I can not believe this movie is rated as high as it is. I have only scratch the surface of flaws in this movie without not even mentioning the titanic sinking plot holes."
189,"I just finished watching the movie and the first thing I wanted to Google was, ""The Dark Knight Rises plot holes,"" because I COULDN'T be the only one who saw them all. Lo and behold, there were hundreds of people writing about them. I then breathed a sigh of relief that people were actually critically analyzing vs. blindly absorbing. BUT, then I went to this website and saw the movie rated 8.6 out of 10!!! The 46th best movie of all time??!! Are you fu*king kidding me??!! What a joke.The sad part is, I bet the people who gave it a 10 out of 10 don't even know what a movie plot is and what makes for a good one. I bet they have no idea what character development is, a movie timeline, logical event sequences, etc. They probably just see guns, explosions, car chases and fighting and thus rate the movie as EXCELLENT...I mean, with all those cool things how could it not be? (eye roll) This is one of the major flaws in a democracy, too many sheep get a vote.Batman Begins was excellent, don't get me wrong and so was The Dark Knight, but this one was not, it's that simply. They didn't even try. Just Google ""The Dark Knight Plot Holes"" if you want to know what I'm taking about. It takes more than cheesy action scenes to make a great movie...oh who am I kidding, if you gave the movie a bad rating I am preaching to the choir, if you gave it a great rating I wouldn't be able to sway you anyhow.To sum it up. The Dark Knight Rises was cheesy, illogical, ridiculous, unbelievable, and went against common sense...but, it did have some really cool graphics and fun toys. However, even if you did combine all the coolest machines and you placed them all in one movie, in the end, it never adds any depth of the plot, it just distracts from it."
190,"This movie should be morphed into a cartoon for kids 7-10 years old. I can't believe that people are allowed to spend so much money making trash like this. And that we still go to see it. Heartless acting ridiculous screenplay and dialogue. Poor production, could barely understand what anyone was saying but so what ....what they were saying we've heard in every other film of this type anyway. And the scene development was chaos. I never knew what was happening or why. When the cops attacked Bane's men who were armed with automatic weapons as opposed to the cops with flashlights and steel bars what a joke, they never fired their weapons!. My advise is don't go to see this shovelled manure anymore at the theaters for $9-12 ea. Rent it if you really need to see it. Also how much of a weepy Michael Caine can anyone take?"
191,"This film is just an example of when directors fall in love with their own hype. Nolan has made some great films, The Prestige, Inception, Batman Begins. This is not one of them!He got off to a good start to the trilogy with Begins, Dark Knight was good when it came out but when I watched it earlier this year it hasn't stood the test of time for me personally.Then comes this one, Nolan had the potential to make something compelling and adrenaline pumping. He didn't. This was little better than 2.5 hours of watching paint dry.1. The action sequences were terrible, I just could not get into the fight scenes as they were so poorly choreographed. On a couple of occasions I saw criminals just waiting to be beaten up, including one scene where you see one guy with his gun trained on Batman who is busy beating someone else up however instead of pulling the trigger he thinks ""hmmm, maybe I should just wait for him to finish with that guy and then let him knock my teeth out?"".2. Anyone that thought Bane was menacing scares too easily. The voice while supposedly based on a gypsy bare knuckle fighter was laughable. It sounded like a really bad Darth Vader impression by David Cameron (current UK Prime Minister). Also his physical stature was not big enough, Bane is supposed to be a man mountain, Tom Hardy is not.3. The Batman voice, how does sounding like you smoke 200 cigarettes a day and could pass out from breathlessness any moment meant to strike fear into the hearts of criminals?4. Joseph Gordon-Levitt becoming Batman - No No No No No, just No! 5. The story is basically the same as Avengers, but the Avengers was more entertaining. As a life-long Batman/Superman/DC fan those words taste like poison but could not be more true.6. The stock market scene was not needed, if you are going to isolate a city from the rest of the country and take it over, money then becomes useless anyway. I thought Nolan banged on about how much of a ""tactical genius"" Bane was supposed to be in the lead up to this films release, evidently Nolan doesn't understand what good tactics are.7. When the police were walking down the street with hardly a weapon between them towards a mass of criminals armed to the teeth I heard ""Fish in a barrel, Fish in a barrel"" being chanted in my head. Joss Whedon 1 - Christopher Nolan 0.All in all I found this film to be far too preachy and pretentious. I don't understand how this film has such a high score on IMDb, maybe it has something to do with the death threats people sent to the reviewers that rated it negatively in the first place and no one had the balls to give it the review it deserved.If you are a weak willed, easily led by what people say you are supposed to like Nolan fan-boy you will love this film, if you are a true Batman fan you will hate this with a burning passion. If you want to watch an entertaining Superhero film that was made this year, watch Avengers."
192,"I still haven't read a credible defense of this turd. Overlong, overstuffed, lugubrious, and entirely nonsensical, I just don't get how anyone finds this enjoyable. The worst Batman movie since Batman & Robin, but at least that didn't take itself seriously."
193,"The high rating of this movie here is unbelievable. Did they WATCH the movie? Especially that it is given status as a ""Top 100"" in ANY forum - absurd. This movie, though filled with all the FX of an high budget movie, was a stinker. Everything had the feel of a contractor, over budget, wrapping up a job before the holidays - contrived story - lacking even abstract, ""comic book"" common sense. Packaged, 'out of hat' storyline. I did like The Dark Knight - though Heath Ledgers role Joker/Devil archetype, was what gave its greatest depth. Though it's not new for a high budget movie to be a dud - the biggest disappointment is how many people (here) laud it so highly. Kind of like politics I guess - people will vote party line regardless of the quality of the candidate. I'm glad I didn't spend any money to see this. What a waste."
194,"The characters of Bane and his team are good and represent a strong cohesion, but the action itself, fights, and realization disappointed me. It seems that the movie production has been accelerated to meet some deadlines and that the realization didn't follow the initial storyline. It makes a nice teenagers' movie though, for someone that just wants to enjoy some special effects. Not much original things have been done to make the movie an exceptional piece of cinema. Well, Super-hero movies are in general not intended to make revolutionary creative images and i guess that Batman fans would be very satisfied with it, although it is a bit lower than the previous ones."
195,"The Dark Knight is one of my favourite films, and I want to like this film, I do, but I just can't. I envy those who love this film but I can't. The Dark Knight Rises is not just disappointing because it is a bad film, but it is disappointing because it comes off the coat tails of the 2008 masterpiece.
Unfortunately, I cannot talk about this film without going through some of the huge plot holes, so spoilers I guess.Nolan did not want to make three Batman films, he only wanted to make the two, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, however Warner Bros roped him back in to complete the trilogy. It is quite apparent that Nolan didn't really want to make this film. There are the obvious problems with the script, like the infamous time skipping from when Wayne escapes the prison to managing to get to Gotham extremely quickly, and everyone has talked about that so I'm just going to skip it.Now, is everyone in Gotham an idiot? I cannot believe for a second that anyone would believe Batman, the protector of Gotham, The Dark Knight, would have killed all these people and Harvey Dent. At what point has anyone seen Batman with a revolver? Surely no one would believe that Batman killed Dent nor killed anyone, especially seeing as he left Joker alive.The Dark Knight Rises has much to many things packed into it's two and a half hour run time.I don't think that anyone needed a sequel to The Dark Knight, so this film does just feel like a contrived, over packed mess of a finale to a pretty good trilogy up until this point. If you do like this film, I am very jealous, but I just couldn't enjoy this film. I suggest you rewatch the film if you enjoyed it because I doubt it will hold up to your memories."
196,"I understand why people like this film, Bane is fantastic, the music is epic, and the prac effects are wonderful (also, the first bane batman fight is brilliant) and it could've been great if it wasn't so full of massive gaping contrivances, conveniences and pseudo-intellectualism. I truly hated the Disney-esque ending. So Batman entrusts the fate of the entire city to an autopilot that has been established as being prone to breaking down? What a jerk! Also, he turns up in public unrecognised by anyone? What about the skyrocketed crimes now due to bane, they need batman more then ever right? They also need a philanthropic billionaire more than ever! (Him losing his fortune via a criminal act is stunningly absurd isn't it? I'm not the only one who realises that would never happen right?)But the 3 worst things about the end 1. it ruins the core theme of the franchise that being Batman has consequences for everyone by giving him a shmaltzy fairy tale ending with catwoman 2. It ruins the brilliant Caine performance, I was really touched and forced to think when I saw Alfred crying at Wayne's tombstone, but that was destroyed by the penultimate scene. YAY! No consequences, everything is perfect! 3. Bane was no longer a revolutionary, he was a friend-zoned dog on a leash of a woman who hates Bruce Wayne so much.... she sleeps with him? WTF?﻿"
197,"It's not easy to make a good film. Thats why people can be so passionate about film that evoke real emotion when they are gripped by plots which enthral them, characters who touch them and themes that are instantly absorbing and recognisable. Not many individuals can attain par excellence in story telling, as it is a finely balanced art that little understand yet alone can duplicate frivolously. If any such individual today can create masterpieces of entertainment, then Christopher Nolan should surely be high up on the list. I had high expectations of a movie that would be well sculpted, like an old master who delicately forms his creation with a finesse that only years of experience and an absolute love of their work can produce, but not so. Here's why...The movie seemed hurried, despite me willing it to end during the last half hour and it being almost three hours long! It felt overly scripted and complex like the script writers were tying too much almost. There was no real enticing flow to the narrative and there were far too many side plots happening simultaneously which was tiresome and frustrating to follow in a 'blink and you've missed it' way. The fight scenes were poorly choreographed and lacking substance at times with no real emotion in them. The plot twist did surprise me, however, I felt it lacked creativeness and credibility due to the poor character development. Character development was a weakness which plagued the movie. Some characters seemed underdeveloped and unconvincing and whats more I felt the actors thought this too, as proved exceptional acting talent seemed unable to deliver the gritty realism that they are renowned for with more than one lacklustre performance.So what's good about the movie?Visually it ticks all the boxes, dazzling your senses with big bold cinematic cityscapes, pyrotechnic frenzies of explosions and an atmospheric melancholy that visually captures Waynes persona perfectly and harks back to the previous movies, establishing the new film as being cut from the same cloth. A credit to the camera/production crew. The special effects also showed the skill of some of Hollywood's best graphic talent, not cheap. Amongst the humdrum of acting lethargy there were some Sterling performances, mainly in the form of Bale who's inspired acting manages to not get dragged down by the wooden staleness surrounding him at times.To sum up...It felt like a poor effort and a typical Hollywood 'money in the bank' job. (Commercial exploitation of previous greatness which is to be expected and frankly, who wouldn't? The film industry is a business after-all) You'll still watch it though. I hope Nolan's next work is not pressured from the money men and his creativity is given the unfettered freedom it deserves. Ultimately this movie should make you realise what an extraordinary talent Heath Ledger truly was.Thanks for reading!"
198,"Quick short comment; DARK KNIGHT RISES is boring, the action scenes are not interesting and the plot is absurd. Acting is fine but some dialogues are unintelligible. Now; let's expand: - At almost three hours, this movie pace is terrible. - Action scenes are very spaced but not spectacular (aside from a few mass movements the rest is pretty rudimentary). Even the airplane highjack, publicized as made without digital effects, does not look that impressive. - Most of the actors deliver; but trying to understand Michael Caine long diatribes or even Tom Hardy behind Bane's mask requires a lot of effort. - There are outstanding performances like Gary Oldman and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the real heroes and most developed characters. Anne Hathaway gets easily away with the treacherous CAT WOMAN and Marion Cotillard completely take over the screen when she is in it. Last, the plot; even fantasy requires a logic; but this is not the case here. In order to justify the revolution and kaos, Nolan created a series of unrealistic events: - A respected senator, gives up everything after a few hours of meeting CAT WOMAN; and an army of SWAT teams, appears in a matter of seconds after someone use the senator's phone. - A computer scam puts a billionaire in state of bankruptcy in a matter of hours; causing even his car to be repossessed - Why taking over Wayne's company when Bane knows everything about everything; even BATMAN's identity. - The newcomer Blake, knows BATMAN identity; but the police chief has no hint at all (even when he ask somebody to contact Bruce Wayne about BATMAN). - What is logic on taking over a city to be blown up three months later? . Besides; what GOTHAN has to do with the personal vendetta behind all this ?. It is not the first time, Goyer's writing breaks logic just to justify some event and Nolan did the same in INCEPTION making the last act absurd; but this time the went as far as breaking almost every possible logic just to make the movie darker and force twists. It is even worse (or lame) that following up on the previous movie; they insist on stating that real facts should be hidden for the common people and the creation of FAKE IDOLS (heroes) are necessary to keep society controlled (a very fascist concept also used by Stalin )."
199,"Batman is crippled by the total lack of connective tissue in every joint. He overcomes this irreversible infirmity by doing intense physical exercise while starving to death with a broken back... not the only ridiculous plot failing, just the major one for me. There was so much unnecessary character back story eating away screen time, and mostly for disposable characters not important to the current plot whatsoever. Since, with Batman incapacitated the majority of the film, a lot of the story focused on the Robin character. It might as well have ended with a ""to be continued"" slap in the face like Matrix Reloaded"
200,"Don't waste your money, The Dark Knight was terribly awesome, every scene in that film as stand alone is better than this film. It was overcrowded with characters, half of whom don't really add to the story, while taking up valuable screen time of the main characters. It missed Batman, this was essentially a film about Bruce Wayne and his problems. The story isn't just about good versus evil (which worked great in The Dark knight and helps focus the film's plot) but wants to explore all kinds of societies problems such as the stock market, evil bankers ('I have my money under the mattress' (""you evil bankster"") and Occupy. Rather then exploring these themes thoroughly it just touches them and then moves on forgetting all about it. Further more, the action is really, really weak! This is a big issue for me since I love action movies, maybe other people will not care as much. But the fighting scenes between Batman and Bane are laughable. Just hitting each other in slow motion, my god, the guy threatens to kill 12 million people but Batman adheres to his code?? It worked great in The Dark Knight, since the Joker was essentially creating chaos, not direct annihilation of a city, but in this film it is totally out of context. That scene where 300 cops run into a fortified position of bad guys armed with AK-47's? OH REALLY?! Where were Batman's gadgets? Not the overblown helicopter thing (my god what an inconspicuous piece of engineering) but the subtle stuff, the smoke, the batclaw, whatever. Just like 007 missing Q, it just doesn't work. They had to repeat some amazing turn with his bike twice in the film just to show something reasonable interesting in the way of action, in Avengers this would have been in the background, once. Blurred. The stadium scene. Mehh, seen it already seventy times in the trailer. Oh.. The film drags on for an amazing 165 minutes! They would have had a better film cutting it with 60 minutes. It would have helped them focus and cut unnecessary scenes (alot you say? Yes!). But the biggest problems with this film is the random stuff that completely sucks: Openingscene: kidnap that doctor? OK. huh whats with the tube and the blood, ehm why do only Bane and that guy hang there after it crashes down when moments before there were like 6 bad guys in the plain on ropes? Huh oh never mind next scene! Why why WHY does Bane hate batman so much? It is insinuated for most of the movie that Batman killed his father, but in the end it shows Bane has no real connection to Batman what so ever? Strange..And that prison/dark pit, in which no sunlight ever shines? ITS LIT UP WITH THE SUN THE ENTIRE FILM! Why do they keep talking on ice where everybody who steps foot on it falls through and dies? Thanks for saving me, lets continue the talk over there where we won't DIE? Yeah let's kill the bad guy, not by batman but a support character, introduce the real villain, and kill her in a car crash 5 minutes later. And damnnnnn the acting in that scene deserves a razzie. Better love story than twilight! Yes Batman, everybody knows you are Bruce Wayne, you can start talking normal, saves you the cough the day after. Bane.. ? Like three people SAY Bane is amazing big etc. But as a viewer, you don't see it, you just don't feel the menace, nothing. Because Bane isn't AT ALL MENACING OR BIG OR SCARY!! His voice, what a failure. Born in the Darkness! .. 140 minutes later, oh no, he wasn't? Or was he? No matter, he's dead. Let's not mention him again in the rest of the film. Robin. Don't get me started. SAVE THE CITY! EXODUS! DRIVE A BUS WITH 15 CHILDREN TO THE BRIDGE AND FAIL IN GETTING THEM ACROSS HAHAHAHAHAHA! Lucius Fox was in this movie?Let's insinuate that Bane's goones are terrible and so committed and 'where does he get these guys?' Oh lets not explain that, lets move on to some surgeon in a prison in a foreign country, whos story we don't CARE ABOUT! AT ALL! PEETIME! Government does not negotiate with terrorists! Next scene, 'they made a deal!' Sigh Etc"
201,What a terrible film. It really tries to blend in three different stories into one film and it just doesn't hold up. The main thing being how they portrayed been that horrible face mask that terrible voice that belongs in the sonic the hedgehog video game. I really feel like the director was just trying to somehow top the dark Knight which he couldn't so he tried his best but it came out like a flat tire. One of the only saving grace is in this movie is cat woman who is played really well and was the only thing that surprised me in this film everything else was just terrible. It's bad enough how they treat Batman like some idiot that barely knows what he's doing let alone how he gave up after his first loss in his career it's just doesn't make any sense why would he go into hiding and then come back out the way that he did acting like he's an old beaten man when he clearly isn't. I feel like they were just throwing in the towel and calling it a day by the very end of this movie it was a waste of time.
202,"That was the exact sentiment I had after watching TDKR. I had been waiting for this movie ever since the first teaser trailer was released. To cut the long and short, I am writing down some first hand reactions I had while watching the movie and the reason I felt that there must be something wrong with me. 1. The great Bane introduction - I failed to see any character development for this character except for towering persona of Mr. Hardy. Well for that matter, it could have been Mr. Dwayne Johnson under the mask. Back to the character, what made Bane, a mercenary, so awe- inspiring that others were ready to die for his words ? Who/what made him an ideologue ? ( especially with the predictable twist at the end ) 2. Our old friend Bruce Wayne - While his limp was rectified by some funky exo-skeleton apparatus, why was his character such a limp all throughout the 3 hours? 1. Letting a girl steal his precious stuff from right in front of his eyes 2. Wallowing over a dead girlfriend 3. Getting cheated by the same gal and getting beaten to pulp by his arch- enemy. 4. Same gal doing the disappearing act before Batman, for him only to manage a cheesy remark "" Now I know how it feels"". Really Mr. Batman is that all you can come up with ?? 5. Sleeping with you dead arch-enemy's daughter? Woww ..Mr. Nolan might call TDKR having the theme ""Pain"", I thought it resounded ""Loser"" better. 3. Butler-Wayne Bro-mance - Everything seen and understood about the importance of Alfred in Mr. Wayne's life. But still I failed to see the entire melodrama of Alfred leaving his master, that too at the opportune moment of Mr. Wayne on the verge of losing everything.4. Everything about Batman has been related to darkness. For me he is a person of the shadows. An ominous dark foreboding demeanor along his incessant internal struggles with his dark demons, everything pointed to a flawed yet enigmatic character that is Batman. I saw the darkness being stolen away from the dark knight. Beats me if I am the only person who saw it 5. The fusion reactor/bomb - Isn't that what it boils down to ? Each time ? 6. Catwoman - In the Matrix movie, in the famous sub-way scene,a program tells Neo about ""Karma"" and the ""purpose of existence"". It further added, programs without a purpose were being deleted. Selina a.k.a Catwoman was such a program in the movie. There was no reason, no purpose and no rationale for her existence within the movie, except for being a side kick. 7. To cut it short, one word for some important scenes - the whole autopilot episode on the bat plane - Cheesy, The end of movie twist - Utterly cheesy, reason for Bane's mask - hilarious, the well-prison break scene - cliché,Blake or Gordon - One was definitely redundant, references to the Charles Dickens novel - superfluous, music - jarring and the movie ending - totally disappointing !!!"
203,"The problems with this mess of a movie are endless. Mainly, it's just boring and completely unbelievable...and way too long. There's not nearly enough Batman and, when he is on screen, he mostly gets his ass kicked. Meanwhile the villains are capable of doing everything successfully. As a result, Batman just comes off as tired and lame. The movie's war scenes smack more of Iron Man than Dark Knight. The movie desperately tries to prove how bad-ass Bane is, but he's just...not. Truly, I expected a scene with Bane loading cancer surviving, crippled grandmas into a bus and blowing them up. It was that silly. All the subplots slow things down: I could care less about the backstory of the chick with the accent, Robin (gee, I didn't see that coming two hours before it happened), the corporate stuff, Alfred's blubbering. Dull, dull, dull. Lastly, the sound is amateur. Everything is pushed up front, so it's often difficult to understand dialogue. Just a disorganized mess."
204,"To everyone who enjoyed the film, congratulations it's always nice to spend a few hours escaping from reality in the theatre.For those of us hoping the creators would build on the previous two films and complete a fine movie trilogy, sadly I left the theatre entirely underwhelmed. The movie was at best a video game with shallow characters and a boring story. At the 2 hour point I heard myself begging for the film to end but it would not.... for another 45 minutes!! How was I rewarded for remaining in my seat for nearly an hour? Batman takes a nuclear weapon out into the Atlantic (after wasting some of the precious last few seconds kissing Anne Hathaway and making Gary Oldman look a bit of a dill) where it explodes. The fact that a cloud of lethal radiation blown by onshore breezes to liquidate the cheering people of Gotham within a day annoyed me but not as much as Batman surviving the detonation!!! I was fine with them planting a headstone and delivering a eulogy but did they need to show him sipping a latte like smug a Goldman Sachs executive retired to the Riviera with their GFC bonus!! The most genuine and believable part of the film was Michael Caines resignation. When he sobbingly explains why he must leave because he can no longer stand by and watch everything he worked for and loves be destroyed in an act of selfish futility..... I couldn't help thinking he made the same speech in Chris Nolan's office! Compared to it's predecessors and the third installments of other film trilogies.... this was a very unsatisfying and poor film."
205,"Whats with all the high ratings... Story was terrible. how can 1000 unarmed cops walk towards the bad guys with guns up an alleyway and not get shot then just start fighting. I fell asleep through this and was dis-appointed with all the hype. Can you trust reviews anymore, I'm not sure.The Dark Knight was very good - i loved it. But this was so bad. Felt tricked at paying to watch this and felt so angry. Batman gets his ass kicked in a fight, then goes away and does a few sit-ups and come back like superman. Batman gets stabbed with a 2inch knife and nearly dies yet he got bullets bouncing of him through the film"
206,"What the hell is wrong with people these days? Why does every impersonal, cliché, unremarkable movie instantly gets in the top 250? Let alone the top 10? I was rather entertained with the two previous movies, mainly thanks to Liam Nesson and Heath Ledger who are fantastic actors. Overrated movies in my opinion, but good enough movies. But there's nothing to save this movie from Nolan's lack of talent this timeHere are the flaws already present in the previous movie that have not been corrected, or got even worse:-Batman's grunting, worse than ever. Jesus Christ you would think after all the mockery that's been done about it, he would at least try to improve that part a bit, but no it's actually more ridiculous than ever. - The music is omnipresent during the whole movie. It goes basically ""tchac boum tchac"" for all the movie, including the dialogue scenes. horrible artistic choice. - The action scenes, dull as hell. How can anyone fin this 'spectacular' is beyond me: there's no tension, intensity or drama in all of them. Nolan had too big a budget and decided to blow stuff up just for the hell of it.But there are new flaws as well! - The villain's motivations, which was what made the previous film interesting, are just completely incoherent! I won't say much more not to spoil anything, but believe me you just spend the whole movie asking yourself: why? why do this? - The villain himself. Without spoiling anything, let's just say all his back-story and charisma is destroyed by one silly, silly twist. - The villains' deaths have to be the most underwhelming I've ever seen. - The references about the current economic crisis: awwww look at these evil traders getting pointed a gun at, didn't they totally deserve it? Yawn. - The love interest. Wayne just randomly has sex with a woman he's barely met. Why? no idea.Overall this movie is dull as hell, and while I can see why people would like the first two movies, there really is nothing to save in that one."
207,"After spending the first part of the day rewatching two of my favourites, Batman Begins and then The Dark Knight, we rushed to get comfortable in our seats and watch the 'conclusion' to Christopher Nolan's Batman series. My friends and I had high hopes and formidable confidence that the director would not let us down. Forty odd minutes in I knew something must be wrong. I was not enjoying the film. What was wrong with me? Over an hour passed and I still hadn't swallowed the pill that countless others had. It wasn't me; it was in fact the story. Or questioning lack of. Epic? Maybe in scale of extra's, explosions, soundtrack and length. Einstein's theory of relativity on excellent display here. I really could not wait for it to end. Then it did. For a moment anyway before it pushed up the Return of the King gear and overstayed its encore.Story, that which is so paramount in the first two of Nolan's take on Batman was lost completely in some terrible dialogue and loud explosions. I'm trying hard here not to put any direct spoilers in and ruin it for those yet to see the film, so you will obviously make up your own mind and really be disappointed like myself or see The Emperor's New Clothes.Minor characters from the first two films are either quickly pushed aside or ignored completely. One character in particular, one for the audience to connect with and our moral compass is lost to one half of the film. Greatly missed.Catwoman, beautiful and well enough portrayed by Anne Hathaway with what little story there was to work with, why was she there? The part could have easy been filled by any number of Banes associates be it the brains that pay him to be a thug or the brawlers who worship him.As for Bane, portrayed with such exuberance by Tom Hardy was the high point of the piece. I really enjoyed all his scenes and interactions with Batman. It's hard to find an actor who can convey so much through just with his eyes; Tom Hardy manages it with ease, giving a realistic frightening performance that demands attention.Again, I don't want to put any spoilers in so I'll wrap it up here. If you wanted to see an intelligent, thought provoking story in the ilk of the first two films you will be disappointed. Story and structure are forgotten and replaced with Michael Bay explosions and loud bangs. I have no problem against such films; I just didn't expect to find it here. I was bored and extremely disappointed, for me, there will only be the first two films. This will fall into the abyss with Die Hard 4.0 and Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull. Oh, and Robocop 3."
208,"I for one, seem to be one of the only reviewers who did not see this film in IMAX, probably for the best, for instead of being engulfed in the ""Imax experience,"" I actually got a chance to concentrate on the individual nuances of the movie.First and foremost, the pro's: I must commend the character of Bane, for his physique and menacing intellect do justice to the Bane of the comic realm (Knightfall/Knightsend era). Unfortunately, thats about as nice as I can be with this flick, Anne Hathaway was absolutely ridiculous in her role, I still cannot even begin to fathom how director Christopher Nolan could try to make a ""down to earth"" style Batman and include such a cheesy character.The imagery in the third installment was incredibly bright considering the dark subject manner. I expect more from Christopher Nolan, for the cinematography in the first two chapters did Batman justice, while this one fell and looked completely bland and boring.The plot holes were many and the movie seemed to drag, almost as if Nolan was trying too hard to out-due his prior installments. A horrid display of an over budget, over zealous mess, that never once even hinted at anything remotely imaginative or new.If you like your movies ridiculously predictable and cheesy than put The Dark Knight Rises on your must see movies, if not, do what I'm going to do, wait for an adaptation of any of the Alan Moore or Frank Miller Batman stories (fingers crossed)."
209,"All right. I've said this before, and I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan is a great director. Few people can put a story on the screen like Nolan does. But the problem is that he's a terrible writer. How many more times does he have to absolutely assassinate a perfectly good story idea or character franchise with his amateurish, ham-handed writing before he and everyone else realizes this? First, he always sets clocks in motion. Really? Is that all you've got? A real writer can create a sense of urgency based on time constraints without introducing an actual clock, especially one that is strapped onto a device that seems to have no other need of a clock than to display its imminent intent to blow everything to kingdom come.Then of course, there's character development, or the lack of it. Batman is conflicted as to whether he should be Batman or not. Bane is conflicted by, oh, let's say puppy love. Catwoman is conflicted by whether or not she really wants to be bad. I mean, I know this whole franchise is based on a comic book, but with a price tag of a quarter of a billion dollars to make, does it have to play like one? Come on, Chris. Hire a writer.Basically, this is a movie that consists of lots of scenes of people either fighting, or walking aggressively toward a fight, with the central characters standing still like a Greek chorus of narrators long enough to tell the story, rather than participate in it, by presenting long, boring diatribes and monologues like a bunch of kids breathlessly setting forth a cowboys and Indians scenario before they run around whooping and shooting, only to repeat, in this case for three tedious, exasperating hours.I love superhero movies when they are able, like all good science fiction, to transcend their admittedly contrived premises by presenting witty and profound issues in clever and unique ways without hammering you over the head or numbing your brain with endless sequences of violence and destruction. Once again, Chris, you have failed in the former by wallowing in the latter."
210,"I sat through 3 hours of this film last night and just could not believe how boring it was, and how it just was not any fun at all. Very little action, lots of brooding and the most boring Batman villain ever. Bane is a third rate Darth Vader, and his voice-over is mixed way too high; plus there is no motivation I could see for what he was doing.My 14 year old daughter was so bored also that she kept asking me when it was going to be over. I personally think this film is an early leader for this year's Razzies. Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Acting, and Worst Editing are some of the potential ""honors"" that immediately come to mind."
211,"CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT REALLY CARE.I rarely write reviews - but after watching the over-hyped brainwash epically named The dark knight rises - i felt compelled to do so.Beware this movie was dreadful in every single sense possible. Besides, it shattered an image of Christopher Nolan as such an outstanding director for me personally.1. Story This movie is a painful attempt to compress a ridiculously long story into a three hour running time. The basic idea to do so is a surefire way to failure. TDKR consists of a thousand cleverly mixed bits and pieces, which make the plot running, but at what price ? Pathetic plot holes covered with computer effects and glazed in ""epic-ness"", shallow characters, lack of logic, cliché dialogs (to say the least). 2. Characters Where they came from? Who they are? Their motives? Their feelings? Their beliefs? You see nothing. Only hints. How do they communicate? They exchange clichés and aphorisms. Gets on your nerves after watching half of the movie. Most reviews say that Catwoman was pretty good and believable, well, i just personally, do not stand women kicking ass - it's men prerogative.3. Batman Batman is not a Batman in it's traditional sense. Wayne overcomes eight-year depression in a couple of days and (wow!) he still is in great physical shape - and without any special preparation turns into a commando. He overcomes all the difficulties, out-plays the police, the military, the whole country, beats the bastards, rides the cool battleship - and saves the WORLD!4. Villain & the threat Bane visually was quite impressive, despite the weird voice, yet the context in which he was put completely diminished the power of a character. He safely lives under the city in the sewage, training a giant army ? I mean, one professionally trained police squad could stop him in real life. He walks around as if police snipers do not exist - just imagine him walking out on the stadium field in real life. Next moment you know it - head shot. Well, script writers thought otherwise. A reactor, which could be used as an atomic bomb? Built right under the center of the city? Oh, c'mon - how stupid is that? You can make an epic movie without a pretension for apocalypse. Miranda ? Who the hell is she - she appears a couple of times on screen and in the end turns to be the head of the whole operation. And what happened to the police ? Giant town is guarded by just a bunch (it is said 3000 people, but looks like no more than 50 or 100) of disorganized cops. Military guys looked even more pathetic.5. Emotions Movie tries to manipulate audience to experience certain emotions, but fails with the only exception - it really makes you tense at times. Romantic story between Miranda and Wayne looks more like a cold one-night stand. Sadness and parental love coming from Alfred towards Wayne seem so forced - i persuaded myself to believe it. Robin's background is not entirely explored and doesn't provoke that much empathy as the director probably have expected.6. Music I don't know who's responsibility is that - i believe an extra sound engineer for a movie would do the trick - the never-ending music just drowned out the voice all the time. With all the respect to Hans Zimmer, the accompaniment would suit a medieval battle movie much better.7. The ""Epicness"" Everything in this movie, starting from the setting and going up to the music is so overly EPIC - it just becomes plain boring after the second hour. Movie tries so hard to exceed all the expectations - it just becomes obvious. I would rate it two out of ten, just for the attempt and the amount of work involved into it's creation. Do not believe the hype!"
212,"Christian Bale is a bad Batman IMHO . His performance really feels like he is acting and the voice is a joke. Combine this with the worst interpretation of Bane since Batman and Robin, alongside a terrible story and poorly executed action scenes, and you end up with one of the worst films in the genre. To top it all of you can ""enjoy"" a terrible Catwoman in Anne Hathaway. Morgan Freeman is decent so it gets a 2 out of 10."
213,"I am not going to give anything away here other then the fact that this is the worst movie of the trilogy. I went into this experience so wanting this to be a great movie. I really did. Needless to say my hopes were burnt to a crisp like the first Wayne Manor.Aside from major plot holes and choices to leave out a lot of back story about main characters who now have new, unexplained idiosyncrasies, The whole story was told without any kind of time-line or rules at all. The rules about physics and the amount of power a human can have and others, just kind of got made up as the story progressed. Furthermore, I saw this at the ArcLight in Hollywood. A place known for it's great sound system and I could barely make out anything that Bain was saying because it sounded like Sean Connery speaking through a sub-woofer.The acting was SOOO bad by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anne Hathaway it's almost like they had no idea how bad they sounded or looked and Nolan just decided not to tell then about it. Gordon-Levitt is normally a great actor. I like that kid in pretty much anything he does, but watching him in this movie was torture, bad lines, horrible delivery. I would give anything to watch the movie while sitting next to him just to observe how he reacts to his own acting. I don't blame him, I blame Nolan. If you're going to introduce new lead characters into the story, at least give us a little insight as to where they've been or why they are the way they are.I'll just say that after sitting through the whole movie, I was reluctant but nevertheless satisfied with the more then obvious ending which was explained but did not need to be at all. It made me think about it for about a half an hour before I decided to not like it, whereas up to the very end, I was really angry about how I got duped into sitting through the whole movie up to that point."
214,"I wasted $15 because of the hype. IMDb users rate this a 9? Well, I did like the motorcycle. The rest of the CG was boring.The plot? I could complain that the villain Bane sounded like Darth Vader and I couldn't understand 50% of what he said. Same thing for Batman's 'disguised' voice. With loud music accompanying all the dialog, It was like listening to a French flick without subtitles, but that didn't really matter because it all boiled down to some bad guys whose presence in Gotham's sewers I don't understand, vs some good guys who had trouble getting along with each other.Shoot, punch, etc. All ordinary and nothing you haven't seen countless times. It dragged on so long, trying to give personality to action figures, that I started to concentrate on the absurdity of all the separate things going on, as each scene seems impossibly illogical and ridiculous if you stop and think about what is happening.Darn, that 2 movies in a row I should not have paid to see. The other was TED."
215,"It's no secret I'm dismissive of Nolans Batman. To me, he is to realistic and, taken out of context (or costume) he is no superhero-in essence, they are superhero films by name only. Batman Begins was dull, but TDK was a solid film that was a fine addition to the batman film universe. So how does this film hold up?To be honest, it's pretty crapTo cut to the chase, lets talk about our cast and characters. Christen Bale is boring in this film. Bruce Wayne isn't compelling in the way Tony Stark or Peter Parker are. I say this because in this film, Batman is in it for 33 minutes. It's mostly Bale being quite wooden, which is shame as I remember him in American Psycho being interesting. I can't say much about his batman other then what's been said all ready-yes, I can't understand that voice. His costume again looks like greens goblins with spiderman-only the expression coming from bale is less expressive.Bane was bad. Gone is the superhuman powered by chemicals with a distinctive mask, replaced with our buffed up Joker wannabe-AKA ""a villain who has something to say about our society."" He's not engaging as he does long gloats like he's the new Josef Stalin-lame. The voice Tom Hardy does sounds like a dodgy crossover between Sean Connery, Jim Carrey from the Grinch and sheogorath. It's also incredibly hard to understand, and scenes with Bane speaking to batman are very difficult to understand because of the voices. I don't get how comic book fans criticise the Batman and robin bane yet praise this one. Sure that one was stupid but he at least had the characters backstory and basic appearance. At he end with a big plot twist, his motivations suddenly make no sense (he protects a young Talia but lets thousands of kids presumably parent less or dead in his takeover of the city?)he comes across as a mere henchman and is shot by catwomen. At worst batmans no gun rule is illogical, but if he can use his brains to defeat the bad guy, its OK. If batman had shot bane at the beginning of the whole thing he might not have lost his money, saved lots of lives, not be beaten to a pulp and not have to live in hiding. Hes pretty crap and not a faithful adaptation at all. The costume designers got a modern day catwomen right, and Anne Hathaway did a fine job in the role. However I don't know if shes a villain, antihero, hero? At least we knew she was a villain in Batman Returns and a (very VERY lame) hero in Catwomen. I blame Nolans writing more than anything else though. Oh, and Hathaway is damn fine in this. Lots of new characters are here along with the old. I swear Joseph Gordon Levitts character was written in just because they hired the guy- and set up a squeal to the ""final chapter"" of this series. Also how the hell did he know who batman is? Just because? Again, more bad script writing. Gary Oldman bring presence but hes not got much meat to chew into-and his characters decision to send all cops into the sewer is one of the worst pieces of script writing ever. Morgan Freeman and Micheal Caine are wasted here and and could've been edited out of the movie. Marion Cotillard is bland and her character makes no sense-she is introduced as a villain and dies 10 minutes later. Payoff, who needs that?The story is so bad-full of clichés, lazy writing and making references to modern day conflicts and terrorist to make it look clever. After the realistic stylings of TDK this throws any realism out of the window. If a terrorist like Bane was under the sewer, than shouldn't Gordon at least notify the government? If Bin laden was seen hiding in New York the Americans would have sent special forces or something. Also I highly doubt that the plane opening would happen-the CIA have radars that could detect a plane that big and would have identified the prisoners by removing the bags before going into the air. Batmans back can't repair itself like that in real life, and he would've been incinerated by the bomb. Also Gotham would have been hit by the radioactive fallout-thanks for ""saving"" the day. The script is full of nitpicks that all add up to plot holes. The realism is abandoned for illogical plot convenience- at least Iron Man 3, the least realistic in its series of films, put in a comic book world to explain certain plot elements. Removing banes super strength to make him more realistic but having huge gaps in realism mean that the excuse ""its a comic book movie"" redundant. The film is boring with horrible pacing problems, having stupid or underdeveloped characters and clunky dialogue that only serves as exposition means this is Nolans worst script ever. The action is boring and half hearted, with clumsy fight scenes littered throughout.Gotham isn't the dark, slightly warped city of the comics any more but the a bland version of new york-again, the modern world aspect of these films means it's not memorable in the way Tim Burtons batman films were. The music is pretty bad, just being loud strings in the background-no tune to hum to along with no tension or emotion.Is this film worse that Batman and Robin? No. Its certainly bloated and boring, but not the cinematic train wreck the B&R is. However while batman & robin can be entertaining because it's bad (evident in it's camp tone) this is a chore to sit through. Its boring, has a stupid script and having very little of it's protagonist in this final instalment, it's a horrible sequel to TDK ,one of the worst entries in batman media and a dull and plain awful ""cinematic"" experience altogether."
216,"Three questions I have to ask myself:Why? Why do I put myself through such torture as to watch this kind of feeble mediocrity. A couple of years ago I posted a comment on The Dark Knight, and if memory serves me right I grudgingly said it was just about OK. Even then I was being charitable, but hey ho. With this one however I only have myself to blame. I knew it would be pointless, but still I went. Which adjective to choose? I want to say ""portentous"" but that won't do. Describing something or someone as portentous, however negatively meant, usually means that the target at least has something, some behaviour, some expression, to be portentous about. To describe a nullity like this movie as ""portentous', well you might just as well describe strawberry jelly in the same way. I could level criticism at any character, at any plot point, but why bother. Suffice it to ask how could something with so much sound, fury and action, be so glacially slow? When Batman was in that silly prison, only good manners prevented me from leaping out of my seat and crying ""for God's sake climb up the damn chimney you miserable ***** !""Second question; What? What do people actually see in this, what are they taking out of it. The movie has garnered a lot of praise and a lot of criticism (not helped by the terrible events in Colorado), but everyone regardless of their stance, seems to take it seriously. Why? What are they seeing that I am so patently not? It cannot be plot, it cannot be acting, it can't really be the action and effects. So, what?Third question; When? When will I ever see another of these ludicrous comic book movies that are being churned out, again? I can answer that one. Never! (at least I hope so!)One last thought; compared to this ""trilogy"" the Tim Burton Batman was a masterpiece; good plot, well structured, well acted (the two Jacks and Keaton actually knew what they were doing) leavened with humour and real wit, something this latest movie could sorely do with.The only conclusion I can come to about ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is that in this dumbed down age it offers a offers a totally spurious and bogus level of ersatz profundity and intellectualism that the audience, who are used to no better, lap up and think is the real thing. But actual entertainment (which movies like this are meant to deliver)? No way."
217,"Honestly, I don't understand why this movie has so many fantastic reviews. I absolutely loved the 1st two batman movies. But the 3rd one was a complete disappointment. And for my review I am assuming that the first two batman movies were never made. Almost nothing in the movie makes sense. Some people like Ann Hathaway's acting but there's nothing special about it, honestly. It feels like Chis Nolan has paid many of the reviewers here. Tom Hardy is a great actor but doesn't quite fit the character of bane. They should have picked up someone like Undertaker from wwe for Bane (someone at least 7 ft tall). Bane was very difficult to understand. (and I live in an English speaking country). even my wife couldn't understand him but was too embarrassed to admit until I mentioned it lol. The story is just weak. At one point it seems the movie is shot in 2012 but the flashback looks like its going back to 1700's. Miranda's story was just rubbish. At one point she sleeps with batman and 30 mins later she stabs him. Really? Mr Nolan? really? oh did I tell you Bane was killed by Celina Kyle (i.e ann Hathaway) and she did it quite easily with that Bat-bike (or whatever you call it). why didn't they just do it before. Guys please stop giving positive reviews just because this is batman. the movie is rubbish, in every way. I didn't review the dark knight(I,e batman 2) on IMDb but I have to say it was brilliant. oh the joker - that was top class acting by Heath Ledger."
218,"I had very low expectations for this film before watching it and sadly this rubbish even failed to meet those.An appalling script completely lacking in a moral compass, subtext (imagine what an intelligent screen writer would have made of all of these orphans?) or clear motivations for the cartoon characters involved at the centre of the drama. As a result there was no tension and I didn't care if everyone was blown up at the end or not. The editing was appalling with one monochrome setting shifting to another in a very flat and monotonous rhythm. The action sequences were really dull. When the cops ran at the baddies the fight scene was as intense as two old ladies squabbling over a cardigan in the January sales! The road chase sequence was like a choreographed run through in a ""how to do a stunt"" video.The soundtrack music was a constant background burble that never actually developed into a theme and was as one dimensional as everything else in the film. Hans Zimmer's score was no match for the epic sweep of Danny Elfman's music in the Tim Burton Batman movies. The acting was disinterested and good actors such as Ben Mendelsohn and Marion Cotillard were wasted in one dimensional stereotypical roles. Ms Hathaway may have been surprisingly good at belting out a song in ""Les Mis"" but here she is the least sexy Cat Woman ever. To be fair to her that is hardly surprising from a Director as disinterested in sex appeal and human chemistry as Mr Nolan ( this is the guy who even made Scarlett Johansson dressed in corsets in ""The Prestige"" seem a little ordinary!!). What should have been highly charged emotional moments such as Alfred leaving Bruce or the public realisation of the sacrifice that Batman had made in the Harvey Dent affair were thrown away.The narrative was muddled, full of holes and lacking in tension. Just how did Bruce Wayne recover from a broken back, climb out of the pit and get back to Gotham on foot, with no resources at his disposal, from what I assume was somewhere like China in about 3 days? How did he get back into a shut down Gotham? As for the twist regarding who was Ra's Al Ghul's offspring – well it obviously couldn't have been Bane because we were told his disfigurement and subsequent medical treatment took a much longer timescale well beyond the escape of that character. So that twist was telegraphed and in that situation when dealing with a script as mechanical as this one you always look to the least obvious character so to see Ms Cotilard declared as the offspring was as easy to anticipate as the fact that she wasn't going to finish Batman off when she had the chance. All as boring and predictable as the supposed poignant finale at the restaurant in Florence which you just knew would be the outcome. In Hollywood films the pay off always has to be signposted!Is this really the best we can expect for hundreds of $millions? A lame 140 minutes of nonsense followed by a final 20 minutes reliant on the same old tired device of a clock ticking down on the side of a bomb? Really??Intellectually Mr Nolan has nothing to offer the intelligent cinema goer (IMDb describes him as being ""celebral"" – yes sure, to Homer Simpson maybe??!! ), emotionally he is clearly pitching his work at the level of a 14 year old school boy who's best friend is his X box and clearly on the basis of this dull waste of time and money he doesn't even have anything interesting to offer so far as technical film making is concerned. That this rubbish achieves 8.5 on IMDb is a perfect metaphor for the mindless consumerism and rampant stupidification of the western world. Honestly if this does it for you then you really need to grow up and read a few non-fiction books about politics, economics or philosophy.. and perhaps even get yourself a real-life girlfriend."
219,"This elongated chaotic murk is studded with stars, but they shed no light. I could tell there was a bad guy, but I couldn't figure out how he managed to breathe. The good guy seemed to be the Batman, but he was too willowy and wispy, and during his frequent bouts of fisticuffs with the bad guy he always got the worst of it. At one point I thought the plot was vaguely modelled on the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. But only vaguely. It would possibly have been helpful to know how the several other stars had been designed to fit in to this benighted epic. I think we should have been told. But I couldn't make it out. My fault, no doubt. After a few hours of bafflement, the scene was suddenly flooded with light, and civilization was saved. The question remained: Had it been worth it ? Not really. This film, bought on a mistaken whim thinking it came in at number 4 on the all-time list, has firmly warned me off any others featuring the legendary Batman. Give me Dracula, any day."
220,"A hodgepodge of mediocre special effects, cliché, and sub-par acting, with an awkward and predictable plot.The only unpredictable part of the film is it's piecemeal nature: almost every character begins as one standard Hollywood persona and without motive changes to another cliché at least once during the film. One can never know what is going to happen next since the sequence of events is only a random permutation of rote super-hero movie themes. The only certainty is that the next event in the chain will be as unimaginative and overused as the last.The sound quality is terrible (it is impossible to understand the villain or Batman at several points) and the pacing is awkward as the first hour covers plot over some weeks and the last hour covers the events over some months without indication.The finale is most disappointing of as the film descends in the realm of utter cliché, even corniness. The slightly surprising twist is once again completely non-sequitur and seemed to be thrown in as a cheap afterthought to give an illusion of depth to the movie. Of course what is one to expect when the villains are nothing but inexplicable anarchists with unclear motives other than a random desire to blow up the world. They are completely unrealistic as characters, as are the heroes.Strong points include Bane's voice (which though undecipherable is powerfully creepy), and a tastefully low use of special effects. This film is not a special effects orgy; the viewer is unfortunately confined to derive enjoyment from the plot."
221,"Reading some of the positive reviews here I honestly feel like I watched completely another movie the other night.The beginning was amazing, but after 20 minutes into a movie, things got cheesy and boring. Lots of close ups, no plot, nothing new... The mask man was interesting for the first 5 minutes and became just plain annoying. Was he supposed to replace the penguin man from the previous batman series? COME ON!!!!!!!!!! No character at all!!!!!!!!!!Cat woman was alright, but nothing special. The connection between her and the batman himself is unbelievable. There was no spark... once again, BORING!I am honestly surprised because I thought it is impossible to ruin batman. I was proved wrong. To summarize, I wish I didn't spend 3 hours watching it."
222,"This review will have spoilers.First off I loved the first two movies of the series. I like the second movie better but the first was also a welcomed gem. Now we're talking about the 3rd movie here and it is a stinker. I almost didn't believe that Nolan directed it and I wondered what the heck happened to Nolan?Why would he allow such an awful movie and here is the reason he did:According to an interview with David Goyer (an awesome writer who worked on this project) him and Nolan got ""stuck"" halfway through the movie with plot devices and concepts because so many elements were involved in the movie. So Nolan told him to take 2 weeks off to clear his head. In those two weeks Goyer came up with the idea and story for ""Man of Steel"", the Superman movie coming out soon. Goyer showed Nolan the idea and Nolan loved it. After that Nolan and Goyer pretty much put The Dark Knight Rises on autopilot and worked on Superman because they knew The Dark Knight Rises it would be a money maker regardless of the piece of trash it ended up being.Now the movie itself is trash but Nolan fan boys are being fan boys and eating it up for some reason. I can picture Nolan and Goyer laughing their butts off about that fact. So basically all positive reviews of Dark Knight Rises come from Nolan fan boys or from critics/media people that want to work with Nolan in the future. The rest of us however are not afraid to call this movie what it is, which is an abomination.So finally my review:The reason I gave this film 2 stars is because the last 15 minutes of the movie was good...or had good enough action and because the acting in the movie was solid. It is a shame that such good acting was wasted on this movie. What is wrong with the movie you ask? Almost everything; the plot is easy to understand but so stuffed with details upon of details that are just there to cover plot-holes that are almost unbearable and translate in to a movie that is mostly talking. Talking about plot devices that are only there to push the movie along. Plot devices need to be in a movie for character growth or major themes or something other than pushing the movie along. So basically this movie was just a bunch of outstanding actors standing around talking about stuff. Talking about stuff you frankly wouldn't give a penny about if it wasn't for just movie the plot along. MAYBE if it was a 8 hour movie then this could have been better because it would give people the chance to care about the characters, plot, themes and etc. I hope Nolan learns from this mistake because it KILLED this movie. That is why I am so upset with the fact that people try to defend this movie! Please don't do that! Nolan has to learn from his mistakes.Lets talk about Bane. Bane played by that guy from Inception (he is also playing Mad Max in the upcoming remake....oh boy..), Bane was the guy that broke Batman's back into comics and you would expect him to be a badass in the movie but that was not the case. I felt like I could have kicked his ass (in fact I really wanted to about 40 minutes into the movie.) He wasn't believable as a badass. He didn't look the part and (maybe because of the mask?) he didn't act the part. Another thing about Bane is that everyone seemed to know who he was before he even set foot in the city. I am not just talking about the FBI; I mean literally everyone one! The cops, Alfred, school kids, random old people..omg I hate this movie so much..Lets talk about all the mistakes... or lets not because this review is already long. Let us just say there were so many basic mistakes like magical knee braces, easy to fix protruding spinal discs, magical ice and so many others. The problem was that this movie was frankly so BORING that you notice every single mistake.Lets talk about Alfred. He left Bruce. Umm...yeah... Wait, wait.. lets examine this. Basically they needed a way to get rid of him while Batman was taken by Bane (revenge of the plot device!)Yeah this movie sucked. I could write a book about all the problems with this movie.By the way this movie sucked. If you were lucky enough not to have seen it then wait for it to come out on TNT. Don't even watch it on HBO because you'll need the commercials. I am not kidding I wish I had the commercials during this piece of.."
223,"I thought I was alone in finding this film almost impossible to follow (not because of an intricate plot) and almost as impossible to understand the actual words. So, I came on IMDb and read some of the reviews. I'm astounded it has 8.6 out of 10!!!! I've never left a review on here before, but I've just sat through a film that is over 2.5 hours long and I'll never claw that time back! I know I know, writing a review means MORE time spent. But honestly, what a load of nonsense. I don't know where to begin with the very jumpy story line (what the hey were we shown the scene in the aircraft with a guy having his blood taken out of him for?!! I still have NO idea what that huge opening scene was all about?), the mad time jumps, the inexplainable lines from some of the key actors - why would Miranda want to honor the father she wanted dead? Why would an army of police, when finally escaped from the tunnels - go in for the attack almost entirely weaponless?!!!You hardly see Batman. I mean REALLY hardly see him. The way some of the film is shot is so poor, the fight scenes between everyone else in the world (even CatWOMAN, who is a girl!!) are intense and pack a punch - but the ones between Blane and Batman look utterly ludicrous, like they are hitting mannequins! I'm all for immersing myself in a film and getting carried away with the action, but I couldn't do that with this, it made no sense 80% of the time. Literally no sense. The scene near the end where a certain person stabs a certain superhero (or at least I thought he was), had me utterly confused as to why she had it in for Batman, were we shown any reasons why that might be?!!Confused, annoyed and not into Batman anymore. I only wanted to watch it to see Wollaton Hall, wished I'd stopped at the first sighting. I still don't get the plane scene?! If I didn't care about wasting my life - I'd make myself watch it all over again, to see if it made more sense....."
224,"Granted, I found the first Nolan Batman to be overblown, dull, trite, and a bit silly (does Christian Bale really need to talk in the Batman voice like that? Thank goodness they made fun of that on South Park), and the second to be a bit better I suppose, but the third might be the worst of all. And the fact that there are those claiming it was ""perfection"" or ""flawless"" must have either seen a different film than I or are taking their job in the studio's marketing dept. way too seriously (most likely the latter).Let's forget Bale's awful voice work which has marred the entire Batman legacy throughout these three films (there continues to be one Batman and his name is Michael Keaton; I'd rue the thought of how the latter-day Burton would ruin the series further, but his initial two remain some of the last great masterpieces of commercial/studio film to be consigned to celluloid in the last era).Why did Bane need to sound the way HE did? I tell you, I'm not expecting cogent story lines or apt character development from a film like this or from Nolan, but as soon as Bane started talking in the first two minutes of the film, my girlfriend and I turned to each other and knew right away we were in trouble. Forgetting the fact he sounds like an arch-villain from an early 80s action cartoon (or an American Sean Connery, perhaps), whomever did the technical work on his ADR really dropped the ball. You can tell easily that his voice was incorporated into the soundtrack in a way wholly different from everyone else in the film. He sounds like he's talking in voice over the entire time. Yikes. If this movie gets nominated for Best Sound Editing, I'll know the Academy has absolutely no credence at all anymore.Other technical and editing faults spiral throughout the film. I blame Nolan again for this, as so many of the scenes in which characters are talking to each other are clearly edited poorly. Really took me out of the film. And, again, I'm not looking for artistry in a shoot-em up comic book movie made for acne-face'd teenagers, but one would think the filmmakers would AT LEAST get the spectacle/technical aspects of the thing right. Shame. Lazy work all around.The acting was, as usual for these films, subpar except for possibly Gary Oldman who for once didn't have a slew of cliché comic book/TV lines to spout (""Gotta get me one of THOSE!"" Yich). Then, of course, there's the many, many, many plot holes that are truly just befuddling. Namely the fact that we have an underground prison that is a central focus of the film and is supposed to be enshrouded in pure darkness, is to be ""Hell on Earth,"" and one of the worst -- if not THEE worst -- places someone can be exiled to... and yet whenever they show the actual place, it's well-lit and the folks who ""live"" there seem nothing but nice, as though inhabiting a communal little village in which you have doctors and gurus and mentors helping each other out. WHY is this place a Hell on Earth that would spawn ""pure evil"" like Bane? I couldn't figure that one out. (And without giving any spoilers, the way out of the place was so obvious -- even to the prisoners themselves -- that it makes one wonder why more of the prisoners don't just up and leave.)You also have the total unreality of a booming metropolis under complete lockdown for like six months and yet everyone still somehow has electricity, water, heat, food, makeup, clean clothes, etc. and even a relatively chipper attitude throughout? I would've thought Gotham would digress into Lord of the Flies pretty quickly, but apparently everyone just stays traditionally phlegmatic in Nolan's yawningly dull cinemaverse. (Not to mention a police force stuck underground who seem to be kinda fine with that after months of no light or clean bathroom facilities.) Sorry, there's suspension of disbelief and then there's just bafflingly lazy writing mixed with lobotomized audience members.As with the first Batman, I was also so incredibly bored for the first hour or so trying to stay awake for Nolan's signature needlessly convoluted, chaotically discursive, and haplessly disorganized ""plot""lines that rather than being fooled like the illiterates who found this movie to somehow be better than Sunset Blvd, The Professional, or Once Upon a Time in the West according to the IMDb score they gave it, I knew -- yet again -- that Nolan is no genius but only a comic book enthusiast who thinks he's making a two-hour TV drama.And two hours were two hours too long here. Even when the movie finally picked up with some action about halfway through (aside from the loud and obnoxious first few seconds that might as well have been one explosion before moving into the doldrums for the next interminable sixty minutes), I had trouble keeping awake, wondering how much longer this seemingly five-hour marathon would go on for. Why didn't I leave sooner? Because $20 for an IMAX ticket is too much to step away from in this day and age and I thought MAYBE there would be some kind of pay-off in the end (there really wasn't; it goes pretty much where you think it would go). So, in conclusion: 1) Fair to poor acting, 2) Awful sound design and voice work, 3) Shoddy/lazy technical logistics, 4) Meandering and hopelessly disorganized script -- surprise -- 5) And, sadly for an action film whose one goal is to entertain popcorn flick style, BORING."
225,"What makes things worse, is that its predecessors were basically intricate works of genius, but TDKR lacks essentially everything that made The Dark Knight (particularly) one of the greatest superhero movies ever produced. On top of all this, everyone's bandwagoning on thinking it's great because it's ""supposed"" to be great, right?!?! How could Nolan's finale not be a masterpiece?! Well, I'll tell you...Bruce Wayne acts out-of-character from not just the first two movies, but from the comic as well. Catwoman's motivation and place in the story is weak, flat, and forced. For a movie that's almost three hours long, you only get about 20 minutes of Batman in costume (if you're lucky). The movie jumps in weird time increments that are mildly confusing, but mostly forced to facilitate its wanna-be epic nature. As for more heavily SPOILERY observations...Commissioner Gordon is barely in the movie, spending most his time injured in a hospital, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character comes out of the blue and does what you'd expect the Commissioner to be doing... solution- COMBINE THE TWO CHARACTERS!!! The two Batman vs. Bane fights are flat and boring as hell. Bane is a cardboard, unexplored (until a late-third act flashback... of all ridiculous cliché plot devices) character that reaches for sympathy in one of the most embarrassing, wanna-be-tender, totally out-of-place, extremely laughable scenes I've ever seen in my life- HE FRIGGIN' CRIES?!!?!? Every single, yes EVERY SINGLE cop in Gotham marches down into the sewers on a tip that Bane's raising a secret army, only to have all the entrances blown up so they can be trapped down there... for like three months. Reread that last sentence and tell me what part of it makes sense.Bane holds Gotham hostage with a 4 megaton nuclear device, after blowing up all but one bridge leading into and out of the city, for three months and the U.S. government does nothing. Seriously, nothing. It's said they negotiated a truce and had FEMA send in supplies for survival. Read that last paragraph and tell me what part of it makes sense.The ""real"" villain reveals him/her self in an absurd Act 3 ""twist"" that's followed by a narrated flashback (the same one that leads to Bane CRYING), and throughout the entire monologue Batman sits there doing nothing after a knife has been thrust/held into his side.After the 2nd lame Bats/Bane fight, the bulk of the late Act 3rd ""action sequence"" consists of little more than Batman flying around in that weird-looking clunky flying thing that supposed to be the Bat Plane- half of which is of him outmaneuvering missiles that the bulky ""plane"" couldn't have possibly eluded.I really, really, really, really, really, really wanted to not just like this, but LOVE it, but as it progressed the enthusiasm cloud gradually cleared to the point of my being utterly flabberghasted in disappointment- mostly because I can't believe the director of The Dark Knight and the masterpiece that is Inception was responsible for this movie. It's lazy and uninspired to the point of being offensive to everyone who's ever been not just a Batman fan, but a fan of non- intelligence-insulting movies."
226,"I don't get what all the 10's are about. I don't see how this movie is a 10, or rather even an 8. There are so many plot holes, the characters are so one dimensional, action sequences OK at best.Where do I even begin. Banes voice. I admit, I didn't get what he was saying more than half the time, and even then I had to strain really hard. It was just awful. There were jokes about not understanding Bales growling, but this, this is something else. The movie would have been better without him talking.Catwoman! Suddenly she feels remorse and becomes goody goody at the end, Oh the lord, this was about as predictable as rain in Seattle(very, if you're unsure).Talia, what a big face-palm. Might as well have made a movie when the Batman woke up from a dream at that point. Can the plot get ANY more clichéd? Thanks for popping up the MAIN criminal at the end of the movie, who apparently had the hots for Batman.Batman, his screen time is mostly groaning and screaming and getting beaten around in boxing by Bane. He becomes a superior fighter by jumping across the ledge? I think that's not how the body works. There isn't any Batman stuff at all. Just punching and kicking. Muhammad Ali would have been a better hero to fit that role (Yay, incoming dislikes from people who don't know who that is). Also, big copter no one can find, yea right.Sheep followers wanting to get blown up. Ya, because getting evaporated by a nuclear bomb is so awesome that every ""mercenary"" wants to do it. Oh, but they didn't know that they'd be blown up.All policemen going underground like a herd of cows because they want to scout out the underground operations and therefore getting caught. Sigh.Big fight scenes. Police officers don't walk in formation with guns against a bunch of mercenaries on higher ground and they all don't start shooting at point blank range. No. That's not how police work. Or any modern force with guns. That ONLY works in Lord of the Rings, because they had SWORDS! Who wrote this script?The other batman movies were good. The first one was great. The second was good too. This one is ridiculous. I don't know how people can be so blind to so many obvious flaws. Even with that, the best moments in this film are...unimpressive. Did I go into the theater with high hopes. Not at all. I expected average, I was disappointed to not find even that.Will be ever get another Prestige from these guys? I hope so."
227,"1. This movie is almost 3 hours long. Out of this 3 hours Batman was sick and crippled 2 hours. He was in his batman suit and did his batman stuff 15 minutes.2. I could not understand 80% of what Bane was saying.3. There are A LOT of long, boring, brainwashing , cliché dialogs.4. Gotham painfully reminded me of LA and NY. I mean really painfully.5. Throughout the movie i had a feeling that i was watching some stupid piece of propaganda how wonderful all super rich people are and how dumb are the rest of us. That orphanage in Bruce's house almost made me puke.Catwoman was rather enjoyable character.This movie, or should i rather say this propaganda piece would appeal to a people with very low IQ and some really die hard Batman fans."
228,"I honestly didn't like this movie very much, there were many things wrong with it that ruined the immersion and messed up something which could have been good.#1 where is batman? for the most part batman is a no show it's not until the final parts of the movie that you even really get to see him fight.#2 Can character development fail? I think this movie proved it can, many movies attribute failure to not accurately linking you to the characters having too limited development of the character, this movie is proof of the opposite in many scenes they spent far too much time focusing on Bruce Wayne. They did this to the extent of completely neglecting many other aspect of the movie, things that should have been delved into that weren't all because too much of the movie was focused on Wayne...#3 The villain makes the movie. Bane was not a good villain, his voice was difficult to understand in a large number of scenes and sometimes the background noise would override him. He just seemed more like a thug then a mastermind, and lacked believability. The so called ""real"" villain had no real character development only back story which to me is not enough to make her important. Also anyone who was a lover of the batman comics or TV show was probably also disappointed by the complete lack of the venom used to give bane his strength.#4 Music and sound effects make a movie right? There were many times during the movie where I found myself distracted by a completely inappropriate sound byte or music that didn't quite fit the scene.#5 abandonment of sub characters is a good thing? the butler leaving Bruce, and the lack of the use of Morgan Freemans character to me detracted from the movie a lot.#6 batmans voice... something was just wrong with it it sounded like i was listening to one of those cheap voice changers you get at walmart. Was it just me or was it done much better in movie one?In summary, I have to honestly say that it seems as if the focus of this movie was on two actors not on two characters. I couldn't find myself feeling for Bruce, or Robin, they were just... badly overdeveloped characters that instead of making me feel sad for them I just didn't care... Batman had 8 years to prepare and get ready for bane yet he wallows in self pity and lets his whole life go to pot over a girl? I just don't believe it. Batman is the definition of self hurt turned into helping others every time batman sinks deeper into the well of despair he hurts criminals more not less. he over came both of his parents dieing and leaving him alone as a child I just could not see him giving up because a girlfriend dies no matter how over developed they made his character.If you like to think about things in a movie, I think you will find that there are too many ""distractions"" in this movie to allow for proper immersion and enjoyment."
229,"I have no Idea what to even start with about what was wrong with this movie. Apart from the obvious Richard Nixon voice Batman has had in every movie of this trilogy, now we also have a villain we can barely understand .They sit there and expect us to believe that with all the time Bruce Wayne spent training and all the time he spent with Ra's Al Ghul he doesn't even know who his daughter is who is very high up in the League?Then they use the classic bomb going to blow up the city. The bomb that was built to be a fusion reactor. So why does it have a clear LED display of the time on it? And why after flying it in reality about 2 miles off the coast no one is hurt. There is no radiation. No title wave from the ocean. Just a cloud.Then lets look at the spare Batmobiles that the enemies have. I find it really hard to believe that I could blow up a batmobile with only one missile yet his is pretty much indestructible.Then when Bruce escapes prison he magically shows up in a town with only one bridge that is guarded by the military. There were so many aspects of the movie where things just happened. And we have no choice but to accept them.The biggest problem of all though, Robin. Why the people in the movie I was in cheered when she said his name was Robin I'll never know. Let's see what the main parts they got wrong were. Obviously the name. His parents dying's back-story was nowhere near right. Robin was a trapeze artist not a detective. I don't know why people like this movie. Maybe because they are supposed to who knows. But if you are a true fan out there then you will most likely hate this film for the crap it is.This movie didn't feel like a Batman movie to me. There was no gadgets, no detective work, no anything. Only thing that this movie taught me is that now I know for a fact. DC cannot do special effects and in the movie industry will always fall short to fans."
230,"The movie was so boring and lengthy that I considered to leave the cinema. The script was predictable at some points and the acting was so poor amongst some of the actors. Anne Hathaway was horrible, she was not convincing at all and her outfit looked like a cheap Halloween costume. Bane, the main villain of this movie was killed in a split second and everything was forgotten about him, that's it. It's like the script writers wanted this movie to end quickly as possible at this point. The actor playing Miranda who appears to be Ra's Al Ghul's daughter Talia should get the award for worst death presentation, it was some of the worst acting I have ever seen, you can tell that she is acting. It's like she is taking a nap for crying out loud. Blake who appears to be Robin gets access to the Batman cave and all the high tech stuff that is in there, but he didn't receive any training at all so he wouldn't know how to use it. Robin is just an ordinary cop in this movie with no combat skills, yet Bruce Wayne gives away the cave to him and settles down with the supposed Catwoman."
231,"i cant believe that some people are giving 10 rating for this pretentious,boring film.some are blinded by the hype and mass hysteria.even though they feel the movie boring,they are not willing to accept it.the guy who sat beside us in the theatre fell asleep halfway through the film and after the completion of film,he woke up and clapped.lol.all they want is part of batman patron and feel cool about it.coming to the film,its a rip-off of Bond film 'The World is not Enough'. In both films, the innocent woman is ultimately revealed to be the true mastermind/villain and the ""monstrous villain"" works for her out of devotion. Both are also willing to sacrifice themselves for love. Not to mention Bane was very much like Renard (villain from TWINE): a single named, intelligent anarchist terrorist with super strength due to a disorder, and we are led to believe throughout the bulk of both films that Bane and Renard are the masterminds behind the plot. Then there's Miranda Tate and Elektra King; beautiful,foreign businesswomen who deal in global energy.Both earn the trust of the hero (Bond/Wayne) while becoming romantically involved with them, though it's all a part of their plan to use the hero's company (MI6 and Wayne Enterprises) to her own ends. The plans are basically the same as well: steal reactor- nuclear material with the goal of nuking an entire city (Gotham and Istanbul). Another leading lady who is foxy at first and helps the hero later.character Q - Lucius fox with gadgets,M - alfred.Just added the holy drama stuff like depressed,burdened,not so-heroic Batman and hope for the city blah..blah.the icy post-apocalyptic,anarchy episodes are boring.there are many plot-holes and logicless scenes like taking a big city as hostage for months"
232,"After seeing and liking the first and the second part of this trilogy, the third came off as a disappointment. There are only a few things that actually work in this movie - Hathaway an Levitt gave very nice performances, and were convincing despite of the ludicrously cliché lines they were given. Before seeing the movie, I presumed that (based on the reviews I had read) they had only minor roles, but the two of them guide the plot. Also some action sequences were well executed. But only a minority of them. The majority was illogical and confusing. In comparison with the second movie which I found to be, in its core ( even with the occasional shabby lines), an intelligent and elegant movie, this one lacks action. Of course that a movie shouldn't be judged by the amount of action, but in lack of it there must be a good storyline. This movie has none. Its plot is full of gaps, frustratingly illogical. One of the things that induced from me a great snore was the jail and childwhoescaped subplot. The idea of the jail is absurd. Whose prison is it, why are there no guards? Oh, I know it's inescapable... but please. Its location is outside of some ancient city walls, but very near it, and a modern complex is build only yards away (you can see it on the edge of the screen when Bruce escapes – but I will get to that). Bane (the Big Bad of the movie) escorted Bruce to the Asian jail himself, made all that way just to tell Bruce that he will torture his soul, and went back to Gotham, in the US, in the matter of hours. Why making that journey? It's impractical as hell. Furthermore, the man in prison, who are paid by Bane to keep Bruce alive (the man actually uttered the line – I'm paid more to keep you alive, when Bruce asked for death), are helping him fix his dislocated spine (no, it's not broken) and escape. Why? After a few tries, Bruce manages to climb the well and emerges on the surface. He throws some big, fat rope back in the pit. Where did that rope come from? Was it left outside just in case someone climbed to freedom so he can free all the other prisoners? Bruce himself had no rope – that was the whole point. Is the prisoners safety rope actually tied at the surface? If so, why no one climbed the rope itself? Hell, my brother with whom I watched the movie actually thought that he threw down the safety rope to make sure nobody else would escape. Then Bruce, with no money, no passport and no knowledge of the native language returns in the terrorist occupied and military guarded Gotham. He also, at the time, has no Batmobile, Batcopter or any other Bat-based vehicle. How did he get into the city? Fortunately, once in the city, he found his Bat-copter lying on the roof of a middle-height building, a huge thing covered only with a nett, and visible from air. With all the riots in the city, is it possible that nobody had stumbled upon it? Also, once in the Bat-copter, he encourages the not-long-ago buried police forces (who all have clean clothes and are clean-shaved after being underground for months) to attack the terrorists, but instead of helping them by shooting the enemy from air superiority, he lands the Bat-copter and seeks Bane for a fistfight. Is this not idiotic? The only action scene that was good was the one after the stock-market attack when Batman made a dashing escape. But, not even this scene can be compared with the ones from the second movie which were thrilling, masterfully directed and longer. They were also simpler, there was no atom bomb, there were just guns and explosives, but it worked better, it was more realistic, and darker. Unfortunately, what replaced action is load of parapsychology, the endlessly recycled story of the orphan Bruce, with many annoying flashbacks from previous films. You know the movie is not doing well when there are flashbacks involved. What got on my nerves a lot was also that all lectured Bruce, the man who sacrificed everything to help Gotham and do good. Alfred was particularly pathetic. Bane is truly a poorly done movie villain. The comic book character is said to have some intelligence. This was not present here. The opening scene, the delivery of the plan of doctor Pavel's abduction: Bane has executed a pointlessly expensive and complicated operation where he sacrificed unnecessarily three of his man, chopped up a plane and then used the already seen skyhook (The Dark Knight), when he easily could have attacked the plane on land. The romance between him and Coltirald's character is also redundant. His and Cotillard's background story could have been left unexplained. Even with it, both of them lack motivation. The rest of the movie Bane makes impressive entries. Actually a lot of the movie is about walking on the street, walking through the sewage, etc. And entering rooms. The romance between Bruce and Cotillard character was redundant and not probable (I accept this only if Bruce wanted a quick shag after a long time of drought). The explosion, beside the unnerving need of certain directors to explain in word what we understood in picture (someone actually had said Explosion! after we've have already seen the mushroom), was not realistic (no waves). But, as a whole, the movie is sufferable, just don't expect anything great. The thing I hated the most is that Batman is missing from this film. Bruce was more out of the suit, than in it. Seems to me that Nolan became a little bit too cocky with all the praise for the two previous movies. It's a shame because the movie could have been a lot better if he hadn't."
233,"I'm starting to suspect there's some mass cultural delusion effect at work here, and in a few decades time people will come to realise that it is, in fact, just about as bad as a film can be and is easily the weakest of Nolan's Batman trilogy. Let's explore why.1. Why is Marion Cotillard in this film? This is the wrong role for her. Her death sequence was a masterclass in bad acting. And if you didn't see the obvious twist that she was Talia after a whole movie of hanging around conspicuously it's time for a sight test.2. That blonde Selina was hanging around with really heavily implied Catwoman was a lesbian, or bisexual if you count her shoehorned-in fleeting kisses with Bruce. Why?3. The movie is filled with pointless characters. ""Here's a new major or minor character, we'll stop the plot dead in it's tracks while they give dull exposition about their past and their motivations"". This happened at least half a dozen times. In the case of Bane it would have been justified... if they had told his backstory all at once, not tediously dragged it out.4. Why did a nuclear reactor core contain a red countdown clock? Did Lucius Fox know that it would be hijacked, and made life easier for the hijackers by letting them know when it would explode? More irritating is how characters in the film keep mentioning there's a bomb and saying how many days/hours remain, like they have forgotten.5. There is no tangible sense of time, of scale, or of anything at stake. I was waiting for the movie to establish a sense of what really mattered. Would it create a real feeling of being in Gotham? It never did: it became more convoluted and confusing instead. I never got the feeling there were millions of lives at stake or that there was anything worth caring about.6. The movie takes itself too seriously. It was a gloomy dirge of self-pity and heavy-handed, lazy commentary about current affairs, with that stupid pounding music score pulsing along underneath ratcheting up the tension because the writing couldn't.7. Robin was written in so he could take on the mantle of Gotham's leading superhero at the end. The other things he did were things Jim Gordon could have done if the movie hadn't put him in a hospital bed. Getting rid of Robin would have also dispensed with the pointless subplot where he is trying to save a busload of orphans. I rolled my eyes at that one.8. In other versions of Batman, Bane is huge because he's on a supersteroid called Venom. In Rises it is never really explained, despite the fact he was a tiny child when he escaped the well prison. His death sequence was also terrible; the film spends so much time building him up as some kind of badass Batman can't beat, then he dies with relative ease.9. The sound mixing was terrible. Even characters that didn't have a stupid mask with batteries taped on the front (Bane) were, at times, very hard to hear. Considering how many millions were spent it really should have had reference quality surround sound audio.10. Chris Nolan is not good at directing this type of picture. In all of the Nolan Batman films (including Batman Begins, which I like despite this problem) he doesn't seem to know how to direct scenes, whether they are action, quiet drama or a mix of both. Camera placement is all wrong. The ""Bane and Batman slug it out on a rusty walkway"" scene feels claustrophobic despite the fact it's supposed to be some kind of huge fighting pit. It might as well be taking place inside a vacuum.11. Jim Gordon in his infinite wisdom stops what he thinks is the bomb truck with... a regular passenger coach, which would have broken apart under the weight.12. Gary Oldman cannot hold his American accent for even one scene.13. Batman is a plot device, not a character. It used to be something special when the cape and cowl were on. But the way Nolan has shot Batman here never made me feel he was the last bastion of justice in a corrupt city, powerful enough to keep criminals at bay with both his mind and his fists. He's one-dimensional and boring.14. Despite the fact Alfred mentions how underprepared Bruce his, despite the fact Bruce's doctor tells him he has no knees, all he does is strap a bionic movement device to one of his legs and is suddenly sprightly enough to be Batman again.15. Plenty of other problems the internet already covered.CONCLUSIONThere's no weight or levity to The Dark Knight Rises because characters and objects jump to where the poorly-constructed plot requires them to be, as if they were beamed there by a Star Trek transporter. The balance of the real and the exaggerated was just right in Batman Begins but in this one it bounces from set piece to boring drama scene and back again with no sense of cohesion, logic or grace. It's a complete mess.On the other hand, maybe it is a great movie and I just can't see it. Or maybe when the cultural zeitgeist changes direction everyone not so close to it and not hyped up to breaking point will see it's not all that. Time will tell.SUMMARY1. It's everything that was bad about The Dark Knight ramped right up.2. It's everything that was good about Batman Begins removed or neutered.3. It wastes good actors and a pretty large budget.4. It is joyless and illogical.5. It is one of the worst films I have ever seen.But it's not all bad: at least it wasn't available in 3D!"
234,"Hype can kill a movie, and I think the fanboys can't handle the fact that this film isn't the cinematic masterpiece it was made out to be. Therefore, they still give the film 10/10 because they can't accept failure. I think this Avengers vs. TDKR crap has really riled them up (note, I am NOT an Avengers fanboy). Ever since the release of The Dark Knight, there have been a new legion of insane fanboys and they outnumber everyone. They are always right, we are wrong. But hey, TDKR is amazing because it's supposed to be, right? Wrong.Let's discuss the film at hand. It's called The Dark Knight Rises which is a stupid name for a movie. Let's discuss how dumb this movie is.John Blake randomly figures out Batman's identity. So according to Blake's logic, every orphan knows who Batman is. Give me a break.The nuclear reactor changes into a bomb in a few minutes. Do some research, this is impossible. It's also funny how it has a LED display. LOL.So, Bruce Wayne falls in love with Selina Kyle after she steals his mother's necklace, steals his car, and then sets him up against Bane which resulted in his back being broken. Explain, why does Bruce love/trust her after all that? It makes no sense. And why does Catwoman randomly change from bad to good? No explanation, which shows the laziness of the screenwriters.The prison Bruce is sent to has a way to escape with no guards. What a weak plot device. You'd think Bane would leave some of his men there just to make sure nothing goes wrong. I mean, he obviously knows people can escape. And plus there is a rope Bruce throws down after he leaves. Couldn't any average Joe just walk up there and throw the rope down? Come on Bane... I thought you were smarter than this!How did Bruce make that jump with an injured knee? No explanation. Lazy screen writing.If you do your research, you will learn that Bruce magically healing his back like that is impossible. More lazy screen writing.Why did Talia wait so long to blow Gotham up? Why not do it right when Batman returns, right when the people regain hope? But she waits, and waits, and waits... also got to love her Razzie worthy death scene.Funny how Batman stands around listening to Talia's final speech when there is a bomb about to blow up the city!Batman gets stabbed but he's OK... because he's Batman.Uhm, why didn't Batman use any gadgets against Bane in the first fight? Well, he used those lame firecrackers, but you're telling me he doesn't have anything better? Seriously.Catwoman possesses the ability to magically appear wherever she needs to be. Kind of like the Joker. It's a pretty cool super-power.The writers couldn't think of anything more original than a bomb timed to blow up a city? Like that hasn't been used before. What a shame that this final film resorts to using so many clichés.TDKR is a fat ripoff of THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, which is a James Bond film. More lazy screen writing.Uh, Bane and his minions magically get motorcycles after the Stock Exchange heist.Day randomly changes to night.Poorly choreographed fight scenes (Nolan is TERRIBLE at shooting action).How about sending almost all of Gotham's police force in the sewers to get Bane? Please explain to me what makes sense about that.Yeah, this film is unrealistic garbage and is an insult to film lovers. If you like clichés, hectic pacing, plot holes, forced romances, cheesy dialogue, and lame action scenes, then this film is for you!"
235,"The characters are void of purpose most of the movie; terrible explanation of why and who are the ""people"" raising against the status quo; fighting scenes that are worst than Chinese B movies (knocking a guy out with a box is not acceptable anymore, or a dozen armed men choosing to wait those extra seconds just enough to fail and then trowing punches at the bat instead of using the guns in the first place), the whole bruce wayne goes to ""hell on earth"" prison that ends up to be a hole with a bunch of old farts where all he does are some sit-ups... come on, it's just plane wrong. But the piece de resistance is when the bat tops the line ""a hero can just be the guy who puts a coat over a children's shoulders and let's him know the world is yadadada..."". I mean, after the dark knight with Ledger, pfffff, this is simply WRONG! Oh, and the end... why make a whole plan to get the bomb to a designated place with all the work involved if all you needed to do was grab a cable and lift it to the sea? I mean, this movie is right there along Charlie's angels and stuff like that. Where's the power punch of the first two? This sucks! Big time!"
236,"In order that this review doesn't sound like it came from the Department of Redundancy Department, I will try not to cover the same ground as my predecessors in declaring that the Emperor has no clothes. Rather, I will try and discuss the little things that made this a big, bad film.Let me also say I am not a worshipper of Mr. Nolan, nor am I a staunch detractor of his. The Prestige is one of the best and most original films I have ever seen. I enjoyed Memento, and also Batman Begins.I was not a fan of Inception, and my feelings on The Dark Knight are mixed. I very much enjoyed Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, and the way the Joker's character was written. I thought the Joker's monologue in the hospital when he explained to Harvey Dent that the hokey pokey IS what it's all about was nothing short of brilliant.I did not come to The Dark Knight Rises ready to hate it, or love it. I watched the film, objectively, and I saw it a second time from a better seat in a different theater, just to make sure I wasn't being unfair.Nope.Sorry Mr. Nolan, sir.Your movie sucks.Why? Because, as the Joker might remind us, the Devil is in the details.Details, details, details, it is the little things that the mind notices. Some of us laugh and call ""BS"" when John Wayne gets eleven shots out of a six-shooter, but we believe it when Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis never have to reload, because they swear and they have dirt and blood on their costumes and faces.For example, the matter of Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.Mr. Wayne is not only Batman, he is also a billionaire businessman. Surely, he would be a bit more, oh, perturbed that his fingerprints have been stolen. Let's be serious. If you found out that your fingerprints, or something else intimately connected to you, like your SSN or your signature had been stolen, wouldn't you be thinking about the possibility of identity theft? Wouldn't you be in a cold sweat that someone was going to use those fingerprints to perform a total cashectomy on you? Well, Bruce Wayne isn't. He's pretty cavalier about the whole thing. Ah, well, so somebody wants to steal my identity. Or my money. It's not like I'm a billionaire or I have a secret identity or anything.Wait.ALFRED! Ah, yes, but Alfred's not coming, Master Bruce. You see, he's so worried about you being completely unhinged, and unready to get back in the Bat-tights, and the possibility that you might be killed that he's just going to take it on his toes and leave you to your own devices when you're at your weakest point and you need him the most.Hurm.And then we have the matter of Miranda/Talia. Here I am thinking Tony Stark's the superhero who'll screw just about any interesting chick who's willing and available, but, well, Bruce has been having a bad month, we'll cut him some slack.Except Tony has staff members who do background checks on his playmates, and staff who dismiss them when he's through playing.With a few bucks and a non-disclosure statement, most likely.You would think that before Bruce Wayne wagered HALF his assets on a business partnership with Miranda, he would have used his state-of-the-art, info-the-KGB-CIA-MI5-doesn't have supercomputer to do a thorough background check.He is the goddamn Batman, after all.Well, he didn't. Not did he do any research on her before they got involved, kind of out of the clear blue sky.But he didn't find her sudden romantic interest fishy, and hey, she seemed like a nice girl, why not pass up Alfred, or Lucius Fox and just let her have the whole shebang.And then, after we discover How Bruce Got His Groove Back, he decides to buy some pastel shirts and abscond to the continent, leaving Gotham, and the Batman legacy in the hands of some cop named Robin (groan) with another very nice girl who has shown him that she's a liar and a thief who probably doesn't have his best interests at heart.Here's to you, Alfred. Sorry you're broke. Good luck with all those orphans and none of my money, relying on the city to keep you funded.Burn the furniture in the rooms you're not using for heat if they cut you off for a few years. Get the boys some paper routes.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go return some videotapes.Hurm, I say again, because this person doesn't sound like any Bruce Wayne I've ever encountered, in any of his many incarnations.I mean, Adam West was a lot more on the ball in the old TV show. And if this is Bruce Wayne as an, ahem, realistic character? Realistically, this self-pitying, egocentric, blundering half-wit wouldn't have ever made it out of that Asian prison in the first movie.Riddle me this? When is Bruce Wayne not Batman? In this film. Because there is no Devil in these details, indeed, if you are looking for The Dark Knight in Bruce Wayne as portrayed in this film, there is no-one there at all."
237,"The plot is a total nonsense from the beginning to the end. They don't even try to make it believable. I know it's a super hero movie, we're not in the real world, but still. I felt this movie was an insult to the public. It's like saying you don't understand anything of what is happening in the world around you, why would you care to understand what is going on in the movie? We end up with a very childish plot where whatever you want to happen just happens with magic. A nuclear reactor turned into a nuclear bomb with a screwdriver in 2 minutes in a garage, a broken spine healed with a rope and 3 push ups, it's all like this. Just boring and lazy. Even the fights are lame. Bane and Batman are supposed to be the 2 best fighters in the world but they fight like a couple of drunk cowboys. Jackie Chan would kick their butt in no time. Can't believe it's rated 8.7 today."
238,"The above quote is from Roger Ebert's review of the 1999 stinkeroo ""Wild Wild West,"" but it is eminently suited to this waste of time, talent, and filthy lucre. The kid from ""3rd Rock From The Sun"" is mind-blowingly miscast as the deuteragonist, the cat lady has all the world-weary sex appeal of a fatal fishing accident, and Nolan's apparent desire to deify and then blow every cop in sight is downright sickening.The mask ""holds the pain in?"" What kind of idiocy are we expected to swallow? This was not just poorly written, but actually asinine, and ""asinine"" is not a word I use lightly, much like ""gonorrhea"" or ""complete transmission rebuild."" Plot holes and contrivances abound, so numerous I shan't trouble with them except to say that conventional wisdom tells us that the US has about a three-day supply of food on hand if the supply chain were interrupted, but Gotham has enough for three months without outside help, which Bane explicitly forbade? Including enough to feed thousands of cops trapped underground, presumably so they'll be on hand for the assault on Mordor at the end of the film? And all this is handwaved away by Detective Exposition telling another character that ""they're getting food and water."" Based on the fit and energetic fellows who show up at said assault, they ate pretty good down there. Let's say ninety days underground at three meals a day for 4000 guys (a woefully small number-- the real NYPD has over 34000 uniforms). That's over a million meals! How'd that work again? Even if they only got one MRE a day, that's over 350000 meals. In a city of about a million and a half (again assuming parity with Manhattan), that's a lotta food. Where'd they get it? I don't ask (or expect) much of films, honestly, but I do insist on crap making sense.To sum up, boring, lifeless, silly, and pretentious. The socialist class-warfare claptrap the cat lady kept spouting didn't help, either. Badly written, mostly badly acted, trite, and conventional. Everything wrong with Hollywood in a 200-million-dollar nutshell. Overblown drivel masquerading as deep social commentary.Dreck."
239,"A mediocre comic book film. While decent at times, there are too many patches of poor dialog the bring out poor performances from the actors. While Bruce Wayne is reluctant to put back on the bat suit, Bale seems equally reluctant to put on his Bruce Wayne suit. His performance is entirely uninteresting and he never seems to recover any fire. Hathaway does a fair job, but she and Bale lack chemistry. A scene with Levitt is so poorly written and performed it is painful to watch. Bane is never menacing. It sounds like he is impersonating Jeremy Irons from Die Hard 3. He also does this ridiculous head shake during his speech, as if to insure the audience that he is speaking. The tie in to A Tale of Two Cities is obvious and ham fisted.  There is so little build up to the behavior the citizens quickly adopt that  it just fails to make itself plausible. While the personal sacrifice from A Tale of Two Cities makes that story powerful, the cop out in this film weakens the whole story.  Some of the action scenes are pretty good. Some are just ridiculous. Batman always seems like some guy in a suit who is fighting a creepy guy with a mask. Overall this movie just fails to ever become compelling."
240,"As time goes by and the hype dies down and the Nolanites either grow up or move on to other agendas, this film will be seen for what it really is; a bloated, stupid, preposterous and dull entry in the cinematic adventures of The Batman. If you are looking for Batman, you will be disappointed as he is scarcely in the film. The first half is particularly dull and could have easily been edited down drastically to ease some of the pain. The pacing picks up in the second half, but unfortunately, so does the absurdity in the plot. The motivation of the villains is never explained in anywhere close to a satisfactory manner and their actions defy all logic. The ending is particularly laughable and even embarrassing to watch. Nolan fans who claim that these Batman films are somehow rooted in the real world aren't really paying attention. This film is every bit as bad as the Schumaker films, worse because this takes itself seriously. THE DARK KNIGHT probably stands as the best Batman film to date despite it's own flaws. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the worst. I'd rather watch Adam West as Batman than this mess."
241,"The music never stops playing through out this terrible movie. Not only was it boring but poorly written with enough plot holes that makes the whole experience painful. Firstly a movie is about Characters, not predictable, lifeless, I don't give a hoot characters. I just didn't care for the characters, I really didn't care if Batman stayed in that middle eastern prison with a broken back. I didn't even care about Gotham exploding into nothing but rubble. This movie offered no real character development, in the end I sat in the cinema bored and thinking that Bane and his leader henchman were doing the right thing. What was this movie all about pleasing Generation Y and hoping they would jump on the bandwagon of DC comic movies. This movie just screams out to Generation Y to love such a mindless film. Like a mosquito to a blue light zapper, if you want to attract Generation Y fill the movie with mindless idiotic action, with very short mindless dialogue, with plenty of music in the background. No need to tell a story, let the music and characters faces do the acting. Biggest waste of time, the only thing this movie achieved was crowning this whole reboot as a bigger joke than Batman and Robin..."
242,"A horrible, bloated, clumsy and often surprisingly amateurish mess that constantly reaches for profoundly unearned emotions and falsely pumped-up thrills. Ann Hathaway's Catwoman is, by miles, the best thing in this overcrowded, misguided concoction (of course she's never called Catwoman, because ultimately Nolan is embarrassed to be doing a super hero movie, as virtually every creative decision he makes here proves). But like anything else that might even be a little bit interesting in this movie, her character and storyline are steamrolled with the rest of the ingredients into a flat, boring cacophony.The music is relentlessly pounding, probably in the hopes that you wont notice how rickety and poorly crafted the story is. Christian Bale virtually phones in his performance. He plays Batman as a mouth-breather (he actually never closes his mouth when in the cowl, making Batman look like some poor kid at summer camp with severe allergies) and he's incapable of bringing the slightest touch of character to Bruce Wayne. Where is Batman the master martial artist? The World's Greatest Detective? The unstoppable force of nature? Not here. Not in this movie. And the amazing Tom Hardy? Completely wasted and mostly unintelligible. The script is a train wreck. There are more plot holes and leaps of logic in this film than in the Avengers, and that movie had a Norse God fighting alongside a monster of science against giant interdimensional worms. The Avengers, by the way, was twice as fun, which was expected, but shockingly, only half as stupid as this movie. Here, let me give you a rundown of terrible, terrible logic loops, sustained stupidity, and just flat out disregard the for audience's intelligence. SPOILERS! 1. A massive terrorist raid on the stock exchange to make a single trade that leaves Bruce Wayne Broke. Okay... what the f.u.c.k.? A. Hacking a computer system does not require proximal space violence. It's called hacking. B. You're telling me they didn't shut down the stock exchange in a crises situation? C. No one questioned a massive trade that rendered one of the wealthiest men in the world broke, when that trade was performed in the middle of a destructive high-speed chase that would have been news across the entire country, let alone the entire world?2. Batman and Bruce Wayne are the least interesting characters to the filmmakers. Batman's time on screen is incidental and his actions boring. It is a Batman film with no interest in Batman at all.3. The Harvey Dent tough-on-crime bill has ended crime? Have you ever seen, in your lifetime, a city go from total social meltdown to utopia where the cops have nothing to do, because of a single bill that was passed? Later, when Gordon knows Dent didn't die a hero, he doesn't tell anyone, because somehow this will make the law less effective? For all his desire to make a ""real world"" superhero film, Nolan obviously has no idea about how the real world works. Toon Town in the Roger Rabbit movie had a more realistic governing set of laws.4. Bruce Wayne is in prison forever and we hear the same damn story told over and over and over again, and it's all gender neutral so they can have one last tedious reveal at the end. 5. ""Your spinal vertebrae is sticking out of your back, here let me just punch it in! GHA! There much better. Only a matter of time before you're batman again.""6. I once saw an episode of Vice Travel where some journalist bought a dirty bomb in Chechnya for a handful of cash. Yeah. But Bane doesn't like doing things the easy way. God forbid he just buy a bomb from a corrupt ex-soviet general. No, instead he elaborately fakes the death of a scientist (apparently the only nuclear physicist in the world, by the way), waits for Wayne to build a fusion generator beneath Gotham so he can then steal its core and use it as an atomic bomb to hold ALL OF GOTHAM hostage. Then kills the scientist.7. It takes five months for the US to send special ops into Gotham? Really? Let's say Gotham is New York, which it is in this ponderous piece of crap. Let's say a terrorist was holding New York Hostage... for five months. You're telling me that the citizens of New York, that the military of the United States, that the nuclear scientists of the world... are going to let that happen? That the people won't rise up immediately, that the military won't have drones flying around constantly looking for radiation signatures and have infiltrated the whole damn island with special ops, that the scientists won't figure out a way to drop EMP pulse grenades across the island to shut down the mechanical device that triggers the fission explosion? Five months of just sitting on their hands?8. An atomic explosion off the coast of Gotham, and everything's cool! No worries! Radiation fallout? Na. Poisoned ocean? Forget about it. No big deal.9. And the worst crime of all, the co-opting of the OCCUPY RHETORIC to disenfranchise the movement. Occupy Wall St. slogans are readily and repeatedly spoken by a monstrous, mad, deceiving, mass murdering terrorist. Do we ever see the plight of the average joe in DK Rises? Never. Which is shocking since there are about 300 characters, each with more screen time than Batman. What we get is a real life political movement used in the fictional service of Kangaroo Courts, martial law, and dictatorship. I don't care if Nolan meant for Bane to be using the language of Occupy for his own corrupt and selfish ends, it's irresponsible filmmaking.And that's just some of the eye-rolling stupidity packed into this thing. All and all, DK Rises is tedious, boring crap."
243,"It took me one week to finally watch this whole movie, fell asleep twice, got distracted by lint in my belly button, watching paint dry, etc. I don't know what people are looking at. This was SOO boring and the plot holes and ridiculous story lines was just too much. I agree with all the other negative reviews... couldn't understand anything Bane said, the fight scenes were 'yawn' boring, what happened to Batman's kick ass kungfu???He got slapped around like a 2 dollar hooker... no reasonable explanations for anything-how did he get back to US??? and what kind of ""hell on earth"" prison has cable TV? Policeman come out of dark sewage like they are getting ready for a parade...the big melee fight, police have no guns, bad guys have guns and they just let the police beat them up???Talia's death scene, she needs to go back to acting school, I just burst out laughing...it goes on and on and on. Save your money, wait till it comes to video."
244,"Part 1 and 2 where good but part 3 is something really boring. After the first part of this movie when I saw it in the cinema I still hoped it would get better and maybe even awesome. This didn't happen. The first part of the movie made a couple of my friends, sitting next to me, fall asleep. This almost happened to me too and that would have been the second time ever if it would have happened. Instead I laughed because two of my friends had indeed fallen asleep. batman does almost nothing in the first hour because he is crippled or something. How exciting, a batman who can't do anything. And I'm not writing batman with a capitol b because this batman isn't worth pressing the shift key. Catwoman is pretty cool. The problem here however is that she isn't really Catwoman. She's is just a girl with cool moves and a tight outfit. No cats anywhere. The bad guy is nice but the movie is so slow that it doesn't matter. In the second part of the movie we see batman recovering from a hernia just like that. All of sudden he is the man again. However, this doesn't give you any real cool Batman action. Noooo just the same lame batman action we had to see (or sleep through) all movie long. Most of the things batman does, he does from some bat bike or bat plane which is boring. I almost forgot, the acting by most actors isn't really good. Most of it is boring, again. Except for the butler played by Michael Caine. He's a good actor in most of his movies but manages to make you laugh your ass off when he starts a sentimental lecture to Bruce Wayne. It's so funny when he starts crying and makes the movie even more stupid. It's not that I can't take sentimental moments, no. Believe me, it just looked ridiculous. And of course batman needs someone to follow in his footsteps because well, he kills himself trying to save the city. We can all see who's going to be the new Robin halfway through but I remembered Batman and Robin working together from old series, cartoons etc. These two hardly know each other. I don't know if they even meet in this movie. I can't remember because I'd rather remember a movie that's worth watching like the first two of this series. Or even better, the movies with Micheal Keaton as Batman. That Batman kicked ass!!"
245,"I have just seen this movie and was deeply disappointed. I think this is the worst movie I have seen in years. I really liked the previous film ""The dark knight"" with Heath Ledger in a fantastic role as the joker, but this film !? Why not rename it ""The dark knight s"". The messy plot, all the logical faults, the soft comments where to sacrifice oneself for the city of Gotham, the tears, the worn out wisdom of the wise-man in the cave. I suspect a ""we're only in it for the money"" attitude for the creators of this film, but then again it looks as if they tried but failed, and an expensive film to make it must have been. Why not use some of that money on an intelligent plot. Instead of this mess. Just forget this movie and save your money, and your time."
246,"So is The Dark Knight Rises better than The Dark Knight? If you were one of those fans who prefer Batman Begins to TDK then you'll find much to love about TDKR. And if you weren't then no Batman film will ever match TDK for you. (SPOLIER ALERT)And yes, it is The End, a resounding resolution for what Batman Begins begun. Threads from that film are picked up, lengthened and strengthened, bringing a staunch integrity – in every sense – to the overall arc. Is it perfect? Factor in some clunky catch-up exposition near the start, a cringey log-fire love scene and moments where Hans Zimmer's score nearly foghorns the actors off the screen and the answer's no. An even bigger question: is it up there with The Dark Knight? Not quite."
247,"After reading so many good reviews I was expecting a lot more from this movie. The time line is completely screwed, events even more impossible than any other super hero or even science fiction movie I've seen lately and I can't count the number of times I thought ""Oh come on!.. that's just ridiculous"". Certainly there are nice images and interesting characters but the story sucks so much it made the movie absolutely boring and ridiculous to me.I was not a fan of the previous Batman movies but at least I found something interesting the first 2 movies of this trilogy. This is more like a science fiction movie and nothing like the other movies which were a lot more realistic and close to my idea of what Batman should be like."
248,"Hype. That was all there was to this film Hype. Pure and utter deliriously deluded hype!How could something so obviously bad, get a 9.1 rating? Seriously? The Dark Knight was a good enough movie. I think Heath Ledger made it so. Not to say he carried the whole film, but yea you do miss the presence of such an enigmatic, deep, three- dimensional character, when you have to sit through almost 3 hours of flat, clichéd, unbelievably boring horrible acting. And if you want an actual moment, did you see the Tate death? She did the most over the top, unrealistic death scene. It was basically the textbook ""say-my-last(CLICHED)-words"" then literally splutter to my death!On top of the horrible acting was the fact that it was backed by a very weak script. You couldn't take a step in the movie without your foot falling into a massive plot hole. They seemed to want to get everything they had about Batman and just cram it into the last part of the trilogy. I understand they wanted to cap stuff off, end things, put stuff to rest, but by the end of it, any sane person will be left wondering... What the HELL, did I just watch! The film was bloated, and full at it seams with characters who should really not have had more than 5 mins screen time max. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, was a JOKE! Like anybody else I expected Catwoman to ooze sexuality, danger and power yet I was left holding back my urge to groan and yell at her absolute lack of an au naturale ""femme fatale""-ness. Her persona was too put on, and very unbelievable. I was with my boyfriend, who is a massive Comic fan, and he was begging me to leave by the one and a half hour mark. I wanted to stay and to see how they would finish this (and to be honest at that point, I was wondering when the ""climax"" of the movie would decide to show up"") I should have left when he wanted to, because for every minute the movie ticked over the two hour mark, I was getting angrier and angrier. Before that I had an open enough mind, hoping that the movie would explode something spectacular and yes I expected something to move me like TDK did, but no. Nothing. Nada. The first hour could have been collapsed into a ten minutes and they literally would not have lost anything. There was just too much wrong with it, that even pointing out the good is not worth it. There really is no point. All the people ignoring the glaringly obnoxious negatives and just highlighting the few good parts are truly just sad fans who are so blinded by the hype, that they neglect to use actual taste to really see what this movie is about. And when you look at it through my eyes, it's not about much, except, making money out of blind followers."
249,"The Dark Knight Rises is a complete mess. It's convoluted, silly, inconsistent and worst of all DULL.First I should give a frame of reference for giving it one star. If you compare this to Batman & Robin, then it's not a single star film. It's better than that at least. But I'd rate Batman Begins as an 8/10 and The Dark Knight as 9 or even 10/10. And compared on those grounds this is a total stinker and worthy of just 1/10.The main problem here is just unchecked excess. Nolan has being given (and arguably earned) complete free reign to do what he likes with this franchise. So it's at his door that the blame must fall for this overblown mess.Summer blockbusters falling victim to excess is nothing new. Michael Bay has built his career on it. But whereas his films are an overdose of action over story, here Nolan gets drunk on plot. There are so many plot strands running here and they all end up half-baked and largely redundant. And in his desperate struggle to weave them into something coherent, Nolan is forced to completely abandon character motivation and common sense and literally just shifts characters from one place to another with no cause-and-effect whatsoever.There are so many plot holes here it's simply not worth listing them. A few plot holes can be forgiven in films that set the story in a fantastical universe, but Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were refreshingly serious portrayals of the superhero films and grounded them in a reality close to our own. The Dark Knight rises destroys that reality completely.The characters are mostly bland too. Bane's voice simply doesn't work and he doesn't dominate physically as much as he should either. Catwoman is shuffled in and out whenever it's convenient and as a result we neither like nor dislike her. She's just there. Alfred is now a crying old softie. Gordon switches from terminally ill to Dwayne Johnson. And there's about a thousand other minor characters who are all cardboard cutouts.And finally the dialogue is awful. Remember when Harvey Dent says to Bruce Wayne in TDK ""you either die as a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"" That was a nice line. But if EVERY character talks like that for the whole film it loses all meaning and suddenly you see the writer's hand everywhere. In TDKR people just start spouting pseudo-philosophical metaphors at each other about what the city needs. The city needs an airport, that's what it needs. And the franchise needs a long rest before the inevitable reboot."
250,"As a fan of the Batman Movie series i found this particular Flick to be separate from the rest.The Dark Knight Rises is more mature, less pantomime and more drama. It is a very long motion picture and could have done with some editing.The Dark Knight Rises is more of a crime thriller rather than a superhero movie. It just looked like your average thriller but with the characters wearing silly costumes, that is how serious this film is.Decent performances. A very dark movie. The Batman story line gets darker and darker, they don't have anything else to do with the script due to them already exhausting the lighter comedic story lines with the 90s versions."
251,"The Batman series is different to most of Nolan's work. Nolan combine the original story and his own style well. In all, it's worthy to watch."
252,"I've been a big fan of the caped crusade ever since i was a child thank you to the original Batman movie and its animation series and now in the 21th century something big must be made of this iconic hero and the dark knight rises doesn't disappoint at all. Christian bale will wear his mask for the last time in this epic 3 installment of the franchise and we expect polished perfection. Even though batman was pretty great at this movie some one is to steal the spotlight its the newest big bad, Bane! Tom hardy portrayal of this ruthless nemesis is one not to forget with his addictive dialogue, very caffeinated but yet remarkable accent and fight scenes that will leave you begging for more. The script is top notch on behalf of bane but would have been great if secondary characters such as commissioner gorden and Alferd would be privileged to it. Only concerns where some minor mistakes which i wont pint point.an amazing addition to a franchise that was on edge of slipping. Highly recommended to superhero/batman fans. I give it a 9.5 out of 10."
253,"Greetings Movie Lovers and Movie Makers! This month we will be discussing ""The Dark Knight Rises"". I loved this movie. It is no ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) which was perfectly made but it does its job as a finale and closing movie. Jack ""The Film Lover"" says... I am a Batman fan. I loved it from Adam West to Tim Burton's ""Batman"" (1989). Has it been that long already?! There have been tons of Batman movies as well as TV shows and they are all good in their own way. From Adam West to the animated series I use to watch from 1992 to 1995. They all have their own little spice to them. It's like trying to argue which is the best pizza Italy's or New York's. It's all taste and there are different pizzas and Batmans for everyone's taste! What a great world! There are a bunch of little Easter eggs and treats for the batman fan in this movie. From surprise characters to throw backs even returning cast members from previous films. This movie is a fun ride, with mixed emotions and lots of stress. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the end of a great trilogy and sometimes that's a little hard to swallow. That's why this movie has been criticized by some. It's hard to understand that you can close a story and finish it just right. Going into details will spoil the film for you but you have to remember that Bruce Wayne is a human with no super powers. The movie had to end the way it did. Jack ""The Filmmaker"" says When you make a trilogy there are rules to follow. One of the rules is to treat all three movies as one, with a first, second and third act. In the first film you are introduced to the characters (boring). Second you create havoc and put them in horrible places, which is awesome. Third you close it all and end it with a bang which causes sadness, joy and tons of other mixed feelings. ""Batman Begins"" showed you that Batman can be real and someone can train and build costumes and armor for such an undertaking as becoming a super hero. ""The Dark Knight"" showed you what a sequel should show you. Everything falling apart around the beloved characters we all learned to love from the first film (Think about ""Empire Strikes Back""). The Dark Knight Rises"" closes the trilogy in great fashion. Bane was awesome! Aside from sounding a little bit like Sean Connery, he was maniacal, and very tactical. He was no thug, having a plan since the first scene and he was smart. Also to point out one of the best beginning sequences ever! I am not going to say Michelle Pfeiffer is the one and only Catwoman but I AM going to say that her Catwoman WAS Catwoman! Anne Hathaway's character was a Catwoman type of a thief in this movie but not the Catwoman she could have been. Then again, you wouldn't have the ending you got. So in actuality she was the prefect, (see what I did there?), Catwoman in Christopher Nolan's Batman universe. Jack ""The Parent"" says The movie is rated PG-13 and well you know how I feel about the rating scale. I think as a parent we all individually need to judge movies ourselves. The whole ripping the heart out of a man's chest and casting him to the fire scene in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" only got that film a PG and if it was released today it would have been R. Be that as it may, there are some dark issues in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" so keep it 13"
254,"I enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 10 star because I want to help it's average. My true opinion and feeling in specifics is that the film should have an 8.5, just because Christopher Nolan is SUCH a good director, and maybe an even better writer!Obviously this is not as good as The Dark Knight or something, but it is still pretty good! Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight movies always have brilliant plots and plans that the characters create (like the time in the the Dark Knight when Joker says that he'll blow up the hospital is a certain important government official *or something like that* isn't dead in an hour)!I love Bane, I love the scenes, overall an above average good movie."
255,"*Spoiler/plot- The Dark Knight Rises, 2012. After Gotham has been taken over by a crime boss and syndicate, Batman returns from hiatus to clean-up the city once and for all.*Special Stars- Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Tom Nardy. MOrgan Freeman, Michael Cane. Anne Hathaway.*Theme- Gotham is Batman territory, forever.*Trivia/location/goofs- Watch for a ""catwoman"" character to help Batman and watch for an EX-Gotham PD guy, 'Dick Grayson' near the end of the film to find the secret location of the Batcave by a tip from Alfred. Batman goes back into hiding with his death being faked.*Emotion- I wasn't a big fan of this dark anti-hero Batman that Christian Bale has produced on film. I'm a old-time hero enthusiast. Or what's the point? Bad guys are not heroic and now the good guys? Too confusing. People need some role models and in this film, it isn't till the end to find one. Too much double dealing, traitors, complex bad and good characters, and weirdos to go around. This is a very violent film with deaths by the hundreds for little reason. The drama of that plot act has little use or impact. It's lost. A flat violent film with little watch-ability.*Based on- The Dark Knight Comics version of DC Comic Batman."
256,"The dark knight rises is what epic cinema actually means,it is moving,captivating,visually stunning and filled with profound themes. While I am a huge fan of The dark knight ,I felt that the joker outweighed the batman in that movie,but here Christopher Nolan delves deep into the psychology of Bruce Wayne/Batman and makes him rise through the ashes towards an epic climax which bombards you with its superb action,amazing visual grandeur and a moments that keep you on the edge.Director Chris Nolan takes the film to an altogether new level and stamps his class all over the film.It is filled with various themes and philosophies which he brings out amazingly through well written characters and a gripping screenplay.The score by Hans Zimmer is equally chilling and fills those immensely dark scenes in the film with a haunting yet lyrical quality.The film is filled with twist and turns throughout which keeps you on tenterhooks.But in the end it is an epic Batman film where he falls,adapts and finally rises and comes out triumphant.The acting is great by all the actors,Christian Bale as the Bruce Wayne and his alter ego Batman is brilliant.He emotes the pain of loss as Bruce Wayne and his authority as Batman with bravura,undoubtedly he is the best Batman forever.Tom Hardy as the villainous terrorist Bane portrays the physicality of his character brilliantly and emotes a lot through his eyes,special mention to his twisted dialogs and thinking's which jaw dropping.Anne Hathaway as the cat burglar Selina Kyle is excellent and is far better than any previous incarnations of the Catwoman.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are excellent as Alfred and Lucius Fox and go with the flow of sentiments very well.Gary Oldman as Commissioner Jim Gordon is great as usual but it is Joseph Gordon- Levitt's performance as the Detective John Blake which captivates you.It is a very well written supporting part and his character being a believer in Batman takes the story forward.Marion Cottilard is unsurprisingly good. Overall The Dark Knight Rises is a superbly crafted piece of cinema which represents the frailty of our world and then makes us realize that it is actually a superhero movie where justice will prevail,in the end you realize that it is a near perfect movie in terms of everything and you can't make a more perfect conclusion of a man in a mask's endless saga.Greatly Recommended..................."
257,This movie is really good. it's a great family movie that you can watch with your family and friends. This movie has been released for years now and up to this day it is still one of my favorite movies in the entire world. I thought all the actors did an amazing job. This was a movie that took it's time and a lot of money was invested when you watch the movie you will see that.
258,"8.5The Dark Knight Rises is a film directed by Christopher Nolan. In it's release, many people hated it for being worse than it's supreme predecessor. I thought it was the same - The Dark Knight Rises is in no way superior to it's predecessor, but that doesn't mean it's bad.Firstly, I think it's great. The plot devices are well constructed, the cinematography is no less than outstanding (although I do wish that Nolan had focused more on the actual movie instead of ""look at this amazing IMAX camera!""), and the performances were great. Especially Michael Caine as Alfred.Secondly, I don't see why everyone hated it. Sure, it's worse than the predecessor, but it's not THAT bad. Many elements from The Dark Knight were still kept in this installment. Bruce is still that Detective + Superhero character established 4 years ago.Thirdly, Some of the plot twists aren't very well executed. I won't tell them all (being that this is a spoiler-free review), but some of them don't really affect the plot as significantly as expected. Even some of the most surprising plot twists in this film do not carry enough weight to matter.In conclusion. The Dark Knight Rises is a great movie. It isn't the masterpiece you should be hyped for, but at least it was still one of Nolan's greatest."
259,"The Dark Knight Rises is an action thriller and is the third and final Batman film made by Christopher Nolan. This is also the last time we will all see Christian Bale as Batman. Upon watching the final chapter of the Christopher Nolan Batman saga I feel like this movie and the way the story is told and the depth of character development for the villains in the Dark Knight makes this film unlike anything else in its genre. While most comic book inspired movies are aimed towards a greater audience, the Dark Knight Rises is not afraid to take you into a deeper and dirty superhero world that you will not get from anything in the marvel universe or the Avengers movies. The Dark Knight Rises tells of the return of Batman eight years after he took the blame for Gotham mayor Harvey Dent. These actions made him an outlaw and a wanted man in Gotham but helped to pass more stringent laws to help keep crooks off the streets and make Gotham a safer place. An older and deteriorated Batman is motivated out of retirement by the arrival of a new villain in town that has a well thought out plan to bring Gotham to its reckoning. Bane is the new villain who plans to destroy Gotham and carryout the destiny for his mentor, Ra's al Ghul, who Batman killed in the first movie in this trilogy. Bane is a super testosterone filled character that is excommunicated from Ra's al Ghul league of shadows for being too radical. The story surrounds Batman's struggle to overcome his old age and deteriorated body and challenge Bane for the lasting safety of Gotham. The editing seemed very appropriate for this movie as it showcases the speed of the characters in the numerous fighting scenes and in the chase scenes. The sound use was very effective in the movie. It helps to paint the picture of a dark city being protected by ominous and dark characters and helps to separate the villains from the heroes. All the main protagonists seem to have their own original score as seen when Catwoman enters a scene a piano plays a playful ballad and when Bane enters a scene an ominous chant begins to play in the background which might sound familiar as it is the chant of the other prisoners in Bane's prison. Like all of the Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight films, the cinematography is dark to elicit the films dark presence and to relay a feeling of fear as this movie often muddies the waters of what may be considered right or wrong and who are the bad guys and the good guys as they all seem to be doing bad things, the only difference is what purpose is behind the actions the characters take and are they out to accomplish an overall good. This also seems to be the overall tone and meaning of the movie. Taking into account the social and political atmosphere of the time, one gets a great reflection of the social context as during the filming, the Occupy movement was very strong here in the United States. Many scenes illustrate this example, for instance when Bruce Wayne loses his family fortune and is broke, he has somewhat of a golden parachute as he gets to keep the family Mansion. These golden parachutes resemble the packages some CEO's on Wall Street were receiving at the time following the financial recession the country was coming out of at the time. I found this film to be very enjoyable and would highly recommend it and would give it a 9 out of 10. When word of this final chapter of the Dark Knight Series came out, I thought that there would be a huge challenge for the directors to make a movie comparable to the predecessor film in the series the Dark Knight which illustrated the amazing acting skills of the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. This final episode easily rivals the performances in the second chapter of this film as the screen writers and directors go to a great extent to show the depths of the villains in these films which in my opinion makes the Dark Knight Batman series one of the best film trilogies of all time. The paying public would also agree as this is probably the top selling trilogy in this genre in movie history."
260,"I feel like Batman Begins and this movie are on the same level. They're both spectacular, but there are better movies in the trilogy.The role of Bane was great. His voice was a bit annoying, but overall Tom Hardy did a good job.Anne Hathaway did a good job as Catwoman as well, and the tension between her and Batman makes my heart throb. Speaking of, however, Batman was the most sympathetic in the movie. Mainly because (spoiler) he dies at the end.Overall, I didn't have many issues with the movie, as it is one of my all time favorite movies.Great conclusion to the epic trilogy, which I would 100% definitely recommend."
261,"I confess that I always had my doubts about this film.Of course, due to the resounding success of the film before this one in 2008, it seemed that nothing more innovative and impressive could happen in yet another Nolan Batman adventure.In fact... a third sequel coming 4 years later could even run the risk of ruining the good image of the wonderful second film, something similar to what happened with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.I thought the film was too long, unnecessary,
Tom Hardy didn't convince me as Bane, I thought he was very forced in the role with a deafening voice and an unconvincing caricature.Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was doing well, but she didn't really look good in the role and Christian Bale seemed to be very worn out in the role of Batman.But it turns out that it was all just something very immature in my mind, in fact even seeing this third and final Nolan Batman film nowadays makes me regret not having watched it more often.The plot is very enjoyable to follow, but in fact I think that any Batman film directed by Nolan will be enjoyable to watch, the director understood the character and adapted him like no one else to date (with all due respect to the classics by Adam West and Michael Keaton).The effects are still unbelievably good, just like in the first two films, without a doubt the best moment in the film is when Bruce needs to escape from the prison where he was dumped by Bane and Joseph Gordon-Levitt fit the role very well, being Robin .Even though I liked the film this time, Anne Hathaway still me didn't like much as Catwoman, and Marion Cotillard as Talia doesn't help one bit, yes, she's so similar to the two actresses who played Rachel in the other films that it's even It was difficult to distinguish the three, not even the plot twist at the end helped, but at least it wasn't enough to ruin this third film."
262,"Selina is the one who ultimately ends Bane Hope You Enjoy this movie as much I did just thought you would like to be informed of that little bit of information before you go out and see it. Also When commissioner Gordon tells Joseph Gordon-Levitt's John Blake that the city needs Batman, Blake makes a beeline for stately Wayne Manor, because he's the greatest emotional detective that ever lived. He knew Wayne and Bats were one in the same because he too had felt the pain of losing his parents. As the mysterious thief Selina Kyle rode off into the night, all we could see was the light reflected off of her ass. Oh come on, Robin John Blake? Not Timothy Drake, or Jason Todd or Dick Grayson? I suppose any permutations of those would have been a dead giveaway, but let's not fool ourselves; it was always a dead giveaway. You don't feature an incidental character as prominently as John Blake was in the pre-release media without there being a damn good reason behind it."
263,"I am a big fan of the Batman movies. I like these types of movies because they're violent, gripping, sometimes predictable, fast moving and powerful When crisis threatens Gotham City, Bruce Wayne jumps back into the Batmobile to fight crime. Batman is joined on his quest by an eager orphaned cop a seductive cat burglar, and a violent masked villain. This film was gripping by its colorful cast and numerous plot twists. Nolan used actors that had either appeared in previous Batman films or in his box-office hit Inception, and all of them shone in their respective roles: Tom Hardy was almost unrecognizable in his Bane costume, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard were both excellent—and obviously comfortable with Nolan's directing style and the film's dramatic tone. The one actor that gave this reviewer pause was Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle. She has historically been typecast as the girl next door, so it was a shock to watch her steal and fight her way through the City of Gotham. After a few scenes, however, we were convinced that the casting decisions was a good one, as Hathaway portrayed the darker Catwoman role brilliantly. True to Nolan's style, at 164 minutes, this film is fairly long. There were a few times when the movie felt a bit edgy, but the gorgeous action scenes and impressive dialogue really held the audience's attention and kept them on the edge of their seats. However, the time line was a bit unclear at times. Biggest flaw I found was that it was hard to tell whether it had been days or months or years that had passed since the last time a given character had been on screen. Despite the films minor shortcomings, The Dark Knight Rises is exciting, creative, and dark— and well worth a few hours of your time."
264,"In my opinion this one is the same quality as the original in the Christopher Nolan trilogy, a very enjoyable movie. The only one that beats it out is the Dark Knight.In this movie, we pick up a couple years after the Dark Knight, and we learn that Bruce Wayne locked himself away and retired as Batman. On one day at a party at his house he doesn't show up, when Salina Kyle, more commonly known as Catwoman, breaks in and steals Bruce's mother's necklace, which is what originally drives him out of hiding, along with the fact that there is now a new villain on his way to Gotham. Along the way Bruce falls in love with a woman called Miranda. And Alfred also talks about a prison in the Middle East which is just a hole in the ground with some cells down there. And no one is able to escape it, but one man did.A question I have is: why is Bruce Wayne unable to walk? I hear multiple things in the movie, like some sort of attack. But I'm not sure.Let's talk about Bane now. Bane is the antagonist in this film who's introduced at the beginning as the leader of an underground crime group, who actually has the decency to get his hands dirty and work along side his goons. Later in the film it's said that Bane is the one who escaped the prison and got down there because he was the son of a mercenary and some middle eastern princess, and her father (who's a war lord) didn't like the fact that he did that and banished him down there, but the prinses then offers the freedom of her own and her child up for this random mercenary.Why would that man secretly impregnate the daughter of a war lord who rules the country with an iron fist? That's stupid, and something that's pestering me. And why would the princess offer her freedom up for him? He got her into trouble!! And if that wasn't bad enough instead of letting herself down there she takes the baby with her!! Why! Why would you let your child, who you love, grow up in an underground prison? Hopefully they didn't drop the soap.But yeah, Bane escapes and now is ready to take over Gotham. And to do that he builds some water filter that was part of a failed project of Bruce into an atomic bomb, very safe there Bruce. He did have a flooding mechanism in case of danger, like he knew this was a possibility that could happen. And if it was a failed project that could be turned into a bomb he should've gotten rid of it as soon as it was pronounced as a failed experiment.Bane then kills the only person who would be able to disable the bomb. And he holds the entire city hostage, and the police can't do anything because if someone leaves the city he blows it earlier.Eventually Cat-woman leads an unassuming Batman to Banes underground base which is later revealed to be right under Bruce's base. I liked that because it shows how even Batman can be fooled. Which is proven even more when Bane picks him up and brakes his back over his knee, ouch I felt that. He throws him down into the prison that he climed out of and now Bruce is stuck down there with a broken back while his city is suffering.While he was gone we get to see how even though everyone hates Batman because he killed Harvey Dent and kind of made the crime situation in Gotham worse, they are hopeless without him. Which I really found a nice aspect.Eventually Bruce escapes the prison, somehow gets back to America in record time, like how did he get from the Middle East to the USA so fast?It is then that it's revealed that Bane isn't the one who escaped the prison, although he was in there, and that he's not the main antagonist, both of those titles go to Miranda, in nice plot twist. It's also revealed that the mercenary was actually Ducard, the main antagonist of Batman Begins. Because yep, we're back to the League of Shadows storyline for this one baby!! Miranda came back to avenge her father, and is also the only with access to the water filter turned atomic bomb, and she changed the password to the reactor making it impossible for Fox to put the code in and place the bomb back.After Bane and Miranda are both killed (not by Batman) Batman attaches the bomb to the Batwing and flies it out into the ocean only for it to blow up with him. But he survives which I find weird, like, that was an atomic bomb with a blast radius big enough to destroy an entire city, so even if he ejected himself he would still get blown up. And then he and Alfred somewhat meet in the exact way Alfred had dreamed, which is weird.Conclusion: It's a great movie in a great trilogy, and you can tell that Christopher Nolan put care into it. In the trilogy the best one is the original Dark Knight, with Batman Begins and the Dark Knight Rises being of same quality. It has some little inconsistencies and plot holes here and there but I think you'll enjoy it. Alright, that's it, see ya.P. S. Just like my Dark Knight review this might look more like a rundown of the film, but I did point out things I did and didn't like. It's just that I have a hard time reviewing super hero or action movies. I'm trying my best."
265,"I believe the plot for TDKR is one movie too early. It's a good plot but the pain Bruce Wayne went through isn't as hard as what he went through in begins and the dark knight.In begins, Bruce Wayne had to endure the loss of his parents. In The Dark Knight, Bruce had to endure the loss of his former lover, Rachel Dawes and the one hero he personally thought would replace batman as Gotham's hero - Harvey Dent. Now, as much as Rises seem a fitting ending, somewhere along the lines, to only have The Joker as your only NON-league of shadows villain is somewhat surprising. If it were me, i would have left TDKR as part 6.In part 3, I would have used Harvey Dent/Two-Face to continue the story. As long as Harvey still lives, Batman will find it hard to finish him or put him behind bars. And yes, part 3 is where the characters of Miranda Tate, John Blake, Daggett and Selina Kyle are slowly brought in and developed.I would use Dr Hugo Strange as the main villain in Part 3. The link is from the dude who was suppose to blackmail Bruce Wayne in TDK somehow lost his evidence that Bruce Wayne is Batman to Strange. I would have Selina Kyle and perhaps Edward Nigma worked for Strange.With Two-Face looking to Batman for revenge, and Strange appearing as Batman would make Two-Face confused as to Batman's identity, mission, ethics, life principles..etc. Batman, on the other hand, will keep trying to convince Two-Face the other side of life, that he needs to accept the fact that Rachel is gone and he needs to move on. The emotional turmoil between Batman/Bruce Wayne and Two-Face/Harvey Dent would make Batman more vulnerable, thus, allowing Strange to take advantage of the situation and take control of Gotham.Selina Kyle accidentally finds out Strange's plan; forced to drink some kind of potion before getting thrown off the 9th floor. From there on..her character can slowly be developed to Catwoman.They could have made a story from this point.I would end Part 3 with Batman (hugo strange in disguise) killing two-face and leaving Bruce Wayne emotionally wounded.Part 4 would see Strange and perhaps The Riddler taking on Batman with side scenes showing the rise of the league of shadows. The end of part 4 would display the emergence of Bane.Part 5 & 6 would be my TDKR with the end of Part 5 is the battle between Batman and bane with the latter breaking the bat and sending him down to hell.Part 6 would be how he rises against bane and the league of shadows.So yes, i'd rather Batman be something like Star Wars. Lots of physical, psychological, and emotional turmoil for our hero."
266,"One of the pleasures of The Dark Knight Rises, the third and final leg in director Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, is the way in which he wraps his story back around, connecting it firmly with the origin story told seven years ago in Batman Begins and brings the series to a satisfying conclusion. It is a reminder of how few sequels forget their origins. Second sequels are almost always creative voids, built for profit, not cinema. This is the rare exception.The Dark Knight Rises is not a perfect film, but it delves more deeply and more thoughtfully into the Batman legend than anyone else might have ever dared. Batman gave us a wounded soul whose training and legacy forced him to create a persona that allowed him to be a dark avenger to those who needed him. Nolan allows us to understand that it is also a personal prison, something he is destined to do for the remainder of his life. The Dark Knight Rises questions the need for that persona in an age of global terrorism and high-tech. What then is the need for a two-fisted dark knight? The movie also provides Batman, at last, with a villain that is every bit his equal, not just in strength but in intelligence. Bane isn't the most charismatic of Batman's foes, but he matches him both in the muscles and in the mind. He is also bright enough to have a plight that actually means something. Thomas Hardy plays Bane with an unexpectedly erudite charm, even if his voice comes through a metal mask that makes him sound like a malfunctioning P.A. system.The movie opens eight years after the events of The Dark Knight and finds that Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has retired the batsuit and is living like in Howard Hughes-like seclusion. He is so out of touch that he isn't even aware that Wayne Enterprises is failing. The cops control the streets and Batman's is thought responsible for the death of Harvey Dent. Within the caverns of Wayne manor sits the sulking Wayne, bearded, robed and hobbling on a cane.His lethargy is broken by the threat of a new team of terrorists who have landed in Gotham City. They are led by Bane, a hulking brute wearing a piranha-style metal mask. His intentions for Gotham City are no less than a full-scale revolution. To hold the citizen hostage, Bane's team high-jacks a device with the power to blow the city eight ways from Sunday.The motives of the characters make up the action, which are displayed in two grand set pieces that have real-life implications. One is a raid on the Stock Exchange; the other is the destruction of a football field. It is upon these two events that Bane builds his revolution – destroying the two great pagan gods of modern times: money and sports.Bruce brings the suit out of mothballs only to find that Bane is his equal in every way. He is not only powerfully strong but also clever and devious. There is also a connection between Bruce and Bane that will not be revealed here. What Bane does to Bruce physically gets him out of the way, far from the borders of Gotham City into a cavern beneath the earth where he can suffer while watching his city burn. His only hope for escape is to scale the walls of a strange, ancient well. That's not easy to do with a body that has been beaten to a pulp.On the sidelines, Bruce has formed an uneasy alliance with a cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) whose motives are always in question. Hathaway allows no sympathy into her performance. There is never a moment when we can trust her. Her loyalty to Bruce wavers back and forth with only a very, very faint wisps of romance - more is not needed What has always been a constant in this series is the way in which Nolan allows time and placement in for interesting characters who don't even wear masks. Around the edges of the film is a do-gooder cop named Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who seems to share Batman's gift for deduction, and Commissioner Gordon who is haunted by a decision he made in the previous film that is revealed here. Also, there is a serious theme of regret and redemption on the part of Alfred, Bruce's butler and surrogate father. The subplot involving Alfred's regret over Bruce's decision to reclaim the bat suit is really very touching.Nolan is a great storyteller. His films are always intelligent, always providing action at the service of a story that is worth our time. The Dark Knight Rises is the least of the three Batman films, it takes a long time getting set up and there are some characters that probably could have been excised to make the film leaner. But it is hard to complain in a film that digs so deeply into the origins and meaning what a superhero means to a society in modern times. That is why it is best for Christopher Nolan to stop here with his Batman series. He has said everything that needed to say about Batman and what he has left, in the era rabid for superhero movies, is a model for other filmmakers to follow.***1/2"
267,"Eight years after the Joker's reign of anarchy, Batman, with the help of the enigmatic Catwoman, is forced from his exile to save Gotham City from the brutal guerrilla terrorist Bane."
268,"I've watched the movie twice in the last two days. I'll admit that the first time, I found it a bit confusing. But after watching again with the knowledge what was going on, I was able to analyze it and understand much better. I found that there was pretty much an explanation for everything, though I will admit that some of it was just simply illogical, like (spoiler) sending the MAJORITY of the police force down in the sewers after Bane and his men, leaving no one to protect the city. I would have also liked to have seen more Batman action sequences, but I understand that Nolan was trying to convey that Batman was a shell of himself. (Spoiler)In fact, Alfred actually warned Bruce that he was no longer the same Batman, and that he would not be able to stand up to Bane. This would explain Batman's weak and slow fighting style.As far as Bane, I thought Tom Hardy gave a decent performance. He made you understand that this guy is a complete psycho, and that everything he does is BRUTAL. To me, he commanded every scene he was in, mostly by his presence. However, I didn't like the twist at the end, and I think that they didn't do his character justice by (spoiler) having him shot by a secondary character, and then you hear nothing else about him. The climatic fight between him and Batman was weak, and it left me feeling like ""that's it?"".The other characters were portrayed well. Michael Caine did a splendid job. I've read some reviews that say (spoiler) Alfred left...again, if you LISTEN to the conversation between Bruce and Alfred, you will see that Alfred was DISMISSED by Bruce because Alfred lied about Rachel's decision to be with Harvey Dent, therefore shattering Bruce's entire illusion and belief system.Overall, I enjoyed the movie. There were some illogical sequences, but the movie kept my attention for the full 2:45. It wasn't as good as TDK, but then what superhero movie could be? The Dark Knight was a one of a kind like Michael Jackson's Thriller; this movie is more like the Bad album; a great follow up, but not a masterpiece."
269,"Dear Mr Nolan,please make a Batman 4 with Bale and Gordon-Levitt. This series is by far the best and needs to continue."
270,"This is, without a doubt, the worst Christopher Nolan movie. Without a doubt, they should have ended this on the beautiful cliffhanger last movie.My many, many complaints with this movie begin with the most common of Nolan's issues- the audio mixing. It is at its worst here for sure. Constant battle with the remote to hear the movie and not be blasted with noise.Also, Bane, excluding the character design and voicework, sucks. He lumbers around and lets Batman go free at one point ""because movie"". You're also supposed to... feel bad for him? Which doesn't work very well, because he didn't do much to deserve sympathy. Granted, he had a bad childhood, but other than that... his character is made all the worse by the god-awful pLoT tWiSt that the woman is actually the evil mastermind, which feels SUPER shoehorned in for the sake of a plot twist. I swear, I could hear the writers saying ""it just needs something else... AHA!"" whenever the scene was playing. Also, Bane cries like a baby, which destroys his ruthless persona.The fights suck in this. If you're going to watch this for the action, spare yourself. The fights between Batman and Bane I'll get into in a minute. As for general action- the Batmobile physics are... wonky at best. There's a big fight in Gotham between the police and Banes' goons at the end, which sucked for reasons you can see for yourself should you choose to endure this. The movie tricks you in the beginning where you get this incredible airplane fight, but it gets worse and worse from there. This movie is genuinely the most frontloaded Nolan movie.The pacing is horrid, as with Dunkirk- but even worse. After Bane takes over Gotham, you enter this realm where time passes SUPER slowly for the sake of unnecessary padding. Batman gets put in this hole-prison thing where (everyone is mean?) and Bane intends to keep him for the rest of eternity. That part of the movie is AGONIZING, bc Batman heals suuupeeeeer slooooowly: it's supposed to be around 2 months in movie time.Batman is a weakling in this for whatever reason. NONE of his attacks do anything to Bane, and he looks constantly out of energy (which is fair, because he gave up being Batman for a long time). BUT this makes for really disappointing scenes where he just... gives up. Also, Alfred is an a-hole to Batman and expects him to get married so he can gawk over Batman and his wife eating food. And they do.The ending... well, it's an ending. Batman flies the nuke Bane was going to detonate into the ocean, {killingmillionsofsealife} and they live happily ever- wait, there's MORE?! Yeah, so people who watched the previous movie will remember the whole Harvey Dent coverup thing- they make a speech to the public about how Dent was a bad guy... for some reason. I forgot. I'm so done with this movie."
271,"The Nemesis character is far too ""humanesque"" ""big-bully-boy Human"" to fit into the legacy of Batman, the storyline sucks more than a 10-year-old with sugar candy. Catwoman is hot as hell, but her storyline is obfuscated by complete disconnection, making the flow of the scriptwriting an embarrassment. At best. THE Worst character, Batman, EVER!Batman as a representation of magazine or movie, its worst!Complete unbelievable standard thump and punch nonsense, this IS NOT what the Batman Legacy is about, this tripe is more suited to ""Ironman"" or other fourth League ""superhero"" storylines. Total garbage beginning to end... the only reason for three stars is for Catwoman being so delectably and sensually, super-HOT! Needed more nude scenes with her in it!Beyond that, without Cat-woman I would have scored a 1 star! Save your evening and go to bed early! You're missing NOTHING!"
272,Pretty good. Interesting plot. Bane is great. Spoiled by Anne Hathaway - first film I have seen her in but took an instant dislike.to her
