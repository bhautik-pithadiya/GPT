0,"To tell the truth, I thought the Batman franchise could never be saved, and I was really let down that I may never see my favorite superhero in a good movie ever again. Then I saw the preview to Batman Begins, I didn't really know what to think. New Batman. New Alfred. New story. New style. I wasn't sure why I wanted it 'the old way', but maybe I wanted to the actors in the Batman films I grew up with, to revive themselves and make a good Batman movie. I wanted Robin and sadly, Batgirl, alongside Batman saving the world from another familiar villain.I heard Batman Begins, and I thought great, this was called ""Batman"" in 1989, selfishly I said, ""I want something new!"".But, of course being a big Batman fan, I went opening night to Begings. 2 and half hours later, like the rest of the audience was completely blown away. It was the only movie I had ever been to (and yes I have been to some great ones) where the crowd claps and the end. This was not just golf claps for a popcorn clip, this was a standing ovation for 10:30 pm show in a crowded theater in Austin, Texas.I never would have thought this would have worked, even with Nolan directing. But I was wrong, so wrong. After seeing the X-Mens and Spidermans, I clearly thought Marvel had the upperhand and DC was just simply trying to keep up, again, so wrong.Nolan gave us a dark, gritty, and pleasantly realistic, view of Batman. Bale gives a tremendous performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine was a fabulous Alfred, and Morgan Freeman almost stole the show as Luscious Fox.Even though X-Men and Spiderman(all of them) are wonderful superhero movies, Batman Begins, is just a good, no, great movie. And I think that is what blew people away, that it wasn't just some superhero, special effect, hero gets girl, good guy wins movie, it was a truly dark and well crafted movie, and it maybe stupid to say, but it didn't even feel like you were watching a superhero movie.I don't even think Burton, and his animated style(which works), could have revived this troubled series, that Schumaker wrecked, because like Fantastic Four and Daredevil, tried over do it and give us the latter part of things.So, here is to you Chris Nolan. You saved a franchise. You made an unforgettable movie, that will be remembered as the best superhero movie of all time, but just an all around great and unforgettable movie classic."
1,"It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. Enter Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind 2000's 'Momento', widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As director/co- screenwriter, Nolan creates a richly dark, atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit, similar to that of the Burton films, but less cartoony. The film's screenplay, written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff, it's true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson's character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. Nolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne's backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there's little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.Of course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne's skin, it doesn't hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne's public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.And the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It's very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It's not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne's mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne's arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It's wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his 'fear gas' are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra's Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob. Nolan's knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it's environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don't think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan's realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There's even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What's not to love here?(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)Overall, I'd have to label Batman Begins 'The must see movie of the summer' - it's a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale's powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy's sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it's own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.-10/10"
2,"Christopher Nolan (and cast) have pulled off what I hadn't dared to dream - a Batman every bit as good as Burton/Keaton's vision - and eradicated the camp, feverish memories of Clooney, Kilmer and (cough..) O'Donnell.The story is as good an origin story as you'll find - covering all the major (true-to-the-comic) events, and not wasting ages on them. We see Wayne's all-important training period (previously ignored), and his connection to the Tibetan shadow-ninja clan led by Ra's Al Ghul. We see Bruce come up with ideas for his symbol, his costume, his gadgets, his car, his cave - IT ALL FITS SO PERFECTLY.That's not all - Liam Neeson is perfect (as ever, when Lucas isn't writing his lines), Batman's first mad nemesis (the Scarecrow) is genuinely frightening; with some outstandingly scary 'fear' effects.. Gary Oldman looks just like a young Commissioner Gordon (and doesn't dominate), Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer give solid heavyweight support to the boardroom machinations at Wayne Enterprizes. I love Michael Gough(?) but Michael Caine is great as Alfred. It's only Katie Holmes who didn't ring true for me - not because of her performance, but simply because she looks all of 15 years old (sorry Katie). I am always blown away by Christian Bale, and this is no exception.The fights are great, the Bat-gadgets all there, the car is amazing, the plot is thorough and exciting, Gotham looks great, Batman really is frightening & menacing (and lethal!).. And the scenes with the bats themselves FINALLY get across the idea of how scary they can be.There is some humour, but it's fairly dry. The soundtrack, like all the best original soundtracks, is excellent - you hardly know it's there, but the emotions of the scene are enhanced and boosted. For the most part this is a serious Batman film, with plenty for long-time fans. This NEW Batman is one I'd like to see again. Bravo Mr Nolan, bravo."
3,"I had fearful reservations about this one. I loved Tim Burton's Batman - 12 years old when it came out I was the perfect age for it and I also enjoyed Batman Returns. The franchise went so wrong under Joel Schumacher that I wasn't sure I wanted it resurrected. Not least because Batman was one of the few comics I read and enjoyed as a kid and was always my favourite superhero. I grew up reading the comics, watching reruns of the Adam West TV show and then getting Burton's celluloid vision. I was spoilt for choice as a kid but as an adult now I was concerned revisiting the franchise, especially given Warner's record over the last decade of screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over the place (dare I bring up the Matrix sequels?)However, I am pleased to report I could not have been more wrong about how great Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is. This is better than Burton. Sacrilege, you say?! Well Burton was still cartoony in many elements, he wasn't churning out the bilge of Schumacher but Burton's Batman was still over the top. As a kid this was ideal but Nolan's Batman is real. Everything in this world seems plausible and it is therefore a world that draws you in. Characters' vulnerability is that much more present. Every bruise, every scare, every concern, every emotion seems real.Part of this is that Nolan has assembled an exemplary cast. Again, this concerned me prior to seeing the film. I wasn't sure a cast of big name legends like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman and well known names like Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes wouldn't detract and distract from Batman. I was always sure Christian Bale could be the great moody Batman he's been waiting his career to be but the others I wasn't so sure about.That said Bale is not just good, he's superb. I never thought I'd really be able to envision anyone other than Michael Keaton as the definitive Batman for me but since seeing Batman Begins a couple of days ago Bale has cemented himself in the position. Perhaps Keaton will now be able to escape the spectre of Batman he hasn't truly shaken off for 13 years.The rest of the cast is also pitch perfect. Cillian Murphy is creepy as hell, Liam Neeson is authoritative and imposing, Katie Holmes is strong and sexy (I particularly thought she'd be insipid, she should jettison Tom Cruise and let her talent - which she does have naysayers just watch Pieces Of April - speak for itself) and Michael Caine is an Alfred you've never seen but in fact far more likely as a butler than the aristocratic pomp with which he is usually portrayed. Gary Oldman is also superb in a rare wholly decent character for him as Lieutenant Jim Gordon who gets far more to so here than Gordon has ever had to do before. Only Tom Wilkinson is a little off with a slightly comedic wise-guy American accent that never really convinces.The emotional bond between Bruce Wayne and Alfred is actually a wonderful human heart to the film than Nolan and Goyer have written perfectly.Don't let that make you think the action is not front and centre though. From Wayne's training through the early stages of the film to his early missions as Batman at about the half way point to a thrillingly choreographed chase sequence and an edge of your seat finale this film delivers the cool quotient in bucket loads.Great villains (especially Murphy), great story, great cast, great action... put simply, great film. Probably the best comic-book movie ever made (that's excluding the genius Sin City which I consider a moving comic-book rather than a comic-book movie, that will never be bettered but Batman is a different beast and the best of its kind)."
4,"A young Bruce Wayne watches in horror, as his parents are killed in front of him, later in life, he vows to remove the criminal element from Gotham City.A word on Christopher Nolan first, I am a huge fan, I think of Inception, Dunkirk and Interstellar, but his magical trio of Batman movies began here, a movie that put the franchise back on top.I'm not always sold on origins movies, there have been several misfires, this is one of, if not the best, it feels very organic, at no point does it try too hard, or overdo it, the balance between story, introduction, action and character, pretty much perfect.The Cinematography is incredible almost twenty years on, the choreography, fight scenes look terrific, made at a time where the purpose of the music was to assist the film and not to drown it out, it is also excellent.Christian Bale was perfect casting, one of the best actors in the business, he is first rate, the balance between Bruce Wayne and Batman is spot on, what a skilled actor he is.An incredible supporting cast, Cillian Murphy is equally as good as Bale, putting in a fiendishly creepy and sinister performance as Crane, Freeman, Caine, Neeson, Oldman, I don't think it could have gotten any better than this.Fantastic, 10/10."
5,"I got a chance to see 'Batman Begins' just this past Friday evening. I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the 'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, ""This is it! This is the movie!"" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan's decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that you really don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'm definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question."
6,"This film easily trumps any live-action incarnation we've scene of the Dark Knight before, borrowing heavily from both the comics and the Dini and Co. animated series. This is a hard, fast, driving, heartfelt epic that draws you into the character of Bruce Wayne and makes you damn well care. Batman doesn't play second-fiddle to the villains here like in the other films. It's his movie and that's the way it should be.Much has been said of the film's ""reality"" quotient, and I'm here to say it works. Nolan talks about how Batman's strong because he does push-ups, he gets around because of his gadgets, and by introducing each of them with a plausible explanation, we forget to quibble and go along with it. The technology may be fantastic, but it's believable. And, unlike the ""reality"" of something like Daredevil, Nolan doesn't forget his ideals halfway though and start having Batman wire-jump thirty feet into the air."
7,"I just came back from a special screening of Batman Begins and I must say this is the best movie I have yet seen this year. All of the blockbuster movies I had seen this year with much expectation have been disappointing. But Batman Begins is not the typical corny action film; it incorporates all aspects of genre: action, fantasy, drama, and even comedy. I was at the edge of my seat from the thrills in some scenes and clapping & laughing from the humorous lines that director Christopher Nolan had written for the characters. I was really amazed by the acting performances from the new generation of actors, assuming that they wouldn't have been able to compete with and compliment the talented, veteran actors such as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson. I mean you couldn't have asked for better actors!! Christian Bale was just perfect for the role: he had the intensity, physique, and charm you'd expect a Batman character to encompass. Every actor was casted perfectly for their roles. I even give props to Katie Holmes for playing a district attorney considering her previous roles consisted of ""the young girl"" or ""girlfriend"". I hardly ever see action films nowadays because I don't want to waste my time watching a conventional, corny, over-digitalized,plot less film. To be honest, I gave this film a chance not because it was a Batman movie, but rather because of the talented veteran actors as well as being a fan of Christopher Nolan's previous films. Whether you're a fan of Christopher Nolan or just a Batman fanatic, you'll enjoy every single second of the movie. People of ALL ages will appreciate this film. The violence in this movie is not vulgar, but rather sends out a lot of great messages of loyalty, respect, and humility. Not only is ""Batman Begins"" the best of the Batman series, it is the most unconventional. This recommendation is coming from a person who mostly watches art-house/independent films."
8,"BATMAN BEGINS lives up to what I heard about it being a ""darker"" version, with much less reliance on flippant one-liners or gags, the result being a more realistic feel for what might have been.From the very start, there is a nice chemistry between Alfred, the butler (superbly played by Michael Caine) and Bruce Wayne (excellent job by Christian Bale). The humor is of the gentle kind, almost subtle in its implications, and it sets the stage for the more realistic flow of events to follow. There's a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard that races along with the film, punctuating it in just the right places, at just the right moments, to give a vigorous punch to the action scenes. And there are plenty of them.But the quieter moments are all extremely well played and given depth by real characterizations--not just cartoonish figures. There is depth in all of the performances with the possible exception of Katie Holmes, an actress who speaks in a voice barely above a whisper and fails to project the belief that she is an assistant district attorney. Miss Holmes needs lessons in projecting her voice.Looming over the landscape is Liam Neeson, a distinguished actor who excels in his carefully concealed villainy. He is a force to be reckoned with and displays all of his versatility here. Equally effective in lesser roles are Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer as the Board Chairman that Bruce Wayne ultimately replaces, and Gary Oldman.The story is forcefully presented with magnificent visuals and eye-popping sets that all have a realistic gleam and are yet stylized enough to give credence to the fact that this is all based on a comic strip character.I can't praise Christian Bale enough as the man who dons that mask. He has all the strength and wily intelligence behind his serious good looks and makes the perfect embodiment of the action hero he is portraying. Firm of jaw, direct of gaze, he makes an excellent hero.Praise too for Cillian Murphy, who makes the most of his Scarecrow role behind a mask of creepy blandness, underplaying his role (as most of the others do) so as not to become a caricature, as so often happens in these Batman enterprises. If it's a series of running gags that you expect--as from previous Batmans--you won't find them here. The thrills come one after another, set pieces that are astounding to watch.Well worth the wait. Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job of handling his subject matter with great skill and flourish. Warning note: Perhaps a little too intense for children, but adults are certainly going to appreciate the fact that the real Batman has arrived."
9,"I thought this movie was absolutely spectacular, I took me by surprise. I never thought I would see a Batman movie with depth and that showed the true fear that is the character Batman that he brings to his enemies. Christian Bale did a excellent job and I truly look forward to him in another Batman Movie! The story was absolutely amazing and in my humble opinion very original. Raj Al Ghul is an excellent villain and to portray him in the way he was portrayed was top notch, not to mention he was played very well. Many people I talked to complained that the actor who played him was not of Asian decent. However I believe it truly didn't matter at all.Not to mention Alfred was great. Gordon (later Commissioner Gordon) was excellent as well.No other Batman Movie has portrayed Batman truly as the Dark Knight and as I said already I truly look forward to more along these lines.-ND"
10,"Eight years after the infamous abomination Batman & Robin that killed the Batman franchise, Christopher Nolan stepped in and started a whole new series a darker (even darker than the first two Tim Burton Batman movies) and realistic level. Now at first, I wasn't mad on Batman Begins because at first I thought it was boring and it took a while to get to the part where Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. But after a while, I loved the film. In fact, it turned out to be my favourite Batman movie even though I really like the first two Batman movies by Tim Burton. I really like how we get to see the origins of Batman like the tragic death of his parents and becoming a martial arts expert in somewhere in Asia. Also I think it's clever how they made Batman act like a ninja than a superhero. Christian Bale is really good and intimidating as Batman but I think he's not as good as Michael Keaton's Batman. But also I think the rest of the cast did very well like Katie Holmes, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy. But I can't understand why Katie Holmes was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress. I liked her as Rachel and she was a lot better than Maggie Gyllenhaal; not to mention better-looking. It's too bad The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises weren't as great as Batman Begins. I mean I think The Dark Knight is really overrated. I mean most people seem to be overglorifying it just because of Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker and his death. But The Dark Knight Rises was brilliant and gave a nice ending to the trilogy but I don't think it wasn't as fresh as Batman Begins. By the way, happy birthday to the creator of Batman, the late Bob Kane!"
11,"All i can say is thank you Chris Nolan,,,I still think you will have to be a magician to beat Tim Burton's Batman film's but Nolan has is well on his way to becoming Houdini. This is a film that describe's Batman as he was in the comics and i think as Bob Kane imagined...So how has Nolan done it..Simple..i've seen the xtras on the Region 2 DVD and it appears that he didn't rush anything and really worked hard on this and recruited the best of the best in the movie making business,it's an extremely hard character to portray and a risky franchise as a director to do a good job as Joel Schumacher found out. He has had some good films like The Lost Boys etc but his take on the Batman was purely a joke and i think he had potentially ruined a huge money making franchise...But however it has been saved with Nolan's amazing take on Gotham and Christian Bale's Dark Knight which truly is an amazing likeness to the comics,,,This film has everything that we wanted and more because it has a beginning a middle and an amazing end which makes batfan's itching for more and a sequel which promises just that,,,it has an all star cast too,Morgan Freeman and doing an amazing job in succeeding the great Michael Gough's Alfred we have Michael Caine..The villain is the Scarecrow but in true Gotham Style there are more corrupt going's on in Gotham than good and who are they gonna call to clean it up..Simple.....THE BATMAN...This film has more gadget's and lifelike special effects than any other Batman Film so it's definitely one to watch..Thanks and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did.."
12,"For those of you who were disappointed with the last few Batman movies, 'Batman Begins' redeems the caped crusader in a big way. 'Batman Begins' takes us on a journey through Bruce Wayne's tragic past again, giving us a real insight into what drives and fuels his quest against suffering and injustice. We discover how the billionaire came to be trained in the martial arts, develop his alter ego, and acquire his technological arsenal. Christian Bale gives us a riveting performance as not only a very dark hero, but also a tortured soul looking for the means to combat the wrongs of society, a society that we see is also responsible for the death of his beloved parents. Another thing we notice from the beginning is this story does not tie into that of the other movies in the series. This is however not a disappointing feature, in fact it seems to breathe new life into this timeless classic. So for all of us who have followed the Dark Knight's journey's, strap yourself in for a wild and inspiring ride."
13,"Saw a free screening on Tuesday. I must say, I had my expectations low for this one, as the previous Batman franchises was just cartoony, over the top, and flat out mind dumbing. Why do studios continually think that spending money on 'bankable stars' and special effects will make a ton of money on box office receipts? Granted ""Batman Begins"" has a pretty sizable budget, but they made the right decision with casting actors that can act and hiring a director that shares the same vision of the comic book. You will not see any caricatures of the comic book, but rather be immersed in how Bruce Wayne has that internal conflict of morality as he becomes Batman. Christopher Nolan takes his time developing Bruce Wayne's character in the image that Bob Kane had with his own flair to it. Anyone familiar with Nolan, Christian Bale, and Cillian Murphy's work will not be disappointed with this movie. Make no mistake about it, it is a dark movie, which is what makes it so great. Nolan uses CG effects very sparingly (thank God!).I rarely give movies a 10 out of 10, as I am pretty brutal with ratings, but Nolan resurrects a failed franchise. Personally, this is what Batman should have been all along - The Dark Knight! Anyone who is a Batman, Nolan, Bale, Murphy fan will not be disappointed. I only wish I took that money I spent on ""Star Wars: ... Sith"" went to ""Batman""."
14,"This is the Batman I have been waiting for! Tim Burton's Batman (Batman, Batman Returns) movies were good Tim Burton movies, but not great Batman movies. Joel Schumucher's (Batman Forever, Batman and Robin) I'm convinced were made to mock the Dark knight and destroy his good name. But this new one is everything Batman should be and needs to be. And the villains are all played to perfection! Christopher Nolan is my favorite director and this (along with Memento) is his best work. If you see no other movie this year, see Batman Begins.Note: This is not a prequel to Tim Burton's Batman. This is a completely new Batman movie series."
15,"I can only say what several critics have said before me; at last they capture the essence of the Batman legend on film! What makes this movie so great is how it takes its material so seriously. There is also a main theme that ties the movie together: Fear. It's relentless in its quest to explain why and how a man of Bruce Wayne's wealth and public persona would dress up like a bat and battle crime. This is the core of the movie, and it treats this with confidence and conviction. When a movie believes this much in the story it's telling, it's much easier for the audiences to believe in it as well. This is a big cinematic experience, and it shouldn't be missed. One of the year's best films, and quite possibly the best comic book-hero-movie of all time. If you have seen this movie once, then it gets even better by the second time you see it. And if you haven't seen it yet... well, what the hell took you so long?!"
16,"This latest Batman film disappointed a lot of people....but not me. I appreciated it because they didn't overdo the violence, didn''t have a stupid romance angle to muddy up the real story, and fount it an interesting history of how Batman became Batman. The first hour of this ""prequel"" dealt with his origins. If you're a fan of the comic book stories and the other Batman films, this part in the film should not bore you. It was like a documentary to me, about a topic I was interested in. In fact, on the second viewing I enjoyed this even more.Christian Bale did a fine job as the latest Batman. It's too bad there have been so many actors playing this role, ruining the continuity of this latest series. I hope Bale continues with a few more efforts with this character.It was nice to see Michael Caine in the role of ""Alfred."" He was excellent and the stabilizing force of the story. Katie Holmes did not have anywhere near as big a role, or romantic one, as I expected, and that was fine with me. I just enjoyed looking at her face, leaving it go at that. Gary Oldman was also interesting as a low-key young detective Gordon who would go on to become Commissioner Gordon in all the other episodes (but, once again, played by another actor.)The film ends with what would be the beginning of the first Batman, featuring ""The Joker.""After having seen all the Batman films several times, I now think is the best of them all....perhaps an unpopular choice, but that's my opinion. Don't let the naysayers keep you from watching this movie. You might be missing the best of the Batmans!"
17,"I just wanted 2 know the name of the martial arts that bale studied in training 4 the movie,not in the movie,can any1 let me know?the actor Bale trained & maxed his bod b4 the flick,I saw it somewhere being known as 1 of the most brutal ways 2 train the mind & body,but the rewards are an extreme sense of durability,as well as a natural tolerance against pain,mentally & physically,I was looking 4 fitness training alternatives 2 max out body mass,I am 210 pounds & want the mass as well as the weight @ 225,can any 1 share this info with me?I would really appreciate it thank u very much and I hope u enjoy the flick as much as I did!post! Post!post!"
18,"yup, this film made me cry. it really did. being a hardcore batman fan, i assume i know every little secret, history, background about the dark knight. i've waited 13 grueling years (discounting batman forever and batman & robin for reasons far too obvious) to see a decent BATMAN film. Not only is Batman Begins decent, it has got to be one of THE BEST FILM EVER! i watched the film on its last screening together with my friends in Alabang. after the movie, the entire theater was deserted and i just sat there, still trying to catch my breath. It is that damn good.Christian Bale plays the perfect Batman/Bruce Wayne. Charming, handsome, and ""rich,"" as Wayne. Terrifying, maniacal, sadistic, and blacker than black as Batman. ""It's not who i am underneath, but what i do that defines me."" Michael Caine as Alfred, humorous, he is the rock of the Batman family. Almost always, the exchange between Bale and Caine where Christian tells him ""You still haven't given up on me, have you?"" Caine answers ""Nevah."" Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox. Quite different from the character in the real Batman mythology (which for me is the comic books), but important nonetheless. He's told in the film as the one who supplies Bruce with all of his ""spilunking"" stuff. :) Morgan plays it brilliantly, from his face in the Tumbler while Bruce is driving, to his deadpan humor near the ending of the film. ""Didn't you get the memo?"" That got one of the biggest laughs in the theater.Liam Neeson, Liam Neeson. Awesome! As Henri Ducard and the real Ra's Al Ghul, he was cold, beyond reason. Cold, bad-ass in a great way. Esp. the scenes where he and Bruce were in their ninja suits playing a game of ""hide-and-seek"" with all those ninjas. Some of the best lines came from Neeson's Ducard character. ""Are you ready to begin? Katie Holmes. She's actually the ""weakest"" link as far as all reviewers or critics are concerned, but for a fan, well, she actually is. Not weak, but pretty much, the film could have gone without her. Having her die at the end of the movie would have made an even better way to start the Begins sequel given Batman's occasional experiences with deaths that he feels responsible for. (i.e. the drowned girl in the VENOM series, Jason Todd) But she does put some nice boy meets girl syndrome during the early years of Bruce. (Oh, speaking of history, Bruce Wayne did NOT finish college nor did he finish in Princeton) And, imho, the end scenes where she and Bruce kissed was ABSOLUTELY YUCKY! i dunno, but for me, it was totally unnecessary but seeing as how the protagonist and the girl should kiss even once in a movie scheme held up, well, there ya go. ""You better run!"" Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow actually should have gotten more screen time. He was really scary even in his ""doctor"" mode. the first time we get to see the mask during his talk with Falcone, awesome. We really got to see the extent of how this lean, geeky fellow could actually become one of Batman's worst enemies. Ken Watanabe, very limited screen time. Doggone good nonetheless.and who could forget...Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. ""I have to get me one of those."" Damn right. ""I think you're trying to help."" Can't wait for the next Batman sequel just for the fact that i'd love to see more of Jim Gordon's interaction with the Batman.Overall, this movie gets a perfect 10 out of 5 stars :) This movie has it all. Great plot, dialogue, action, and an array of Oscar caliber actors, definitely, Batman renaissance has begun. Batman Begins."
19,"this was one of my favorite movies of the year. and i don't say that lightly. i saw this movie with my friend as a backup to lords of dogtown which was sold out and boy am i glad i did. Christian Bale did an amazing job with the tough role of being batman. i then saw this with my cousin who loved it as well. this is probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen. superman, horrible. batman, OK. spider-man the first one, OK. spider-man 2, boring. and so on. but this, this was amazing. it was well worth the 10 dollars to see it and i cant wait until it comes out on DVD. one of the best movies of the year and it deserves to be in the top 10."
20,"This is certainly, without question the best Batman film ever made, although that isn't saying much. Christopher Nolan makes this into a very dark and brooding tale that tells more about Bruce Wayne than Batman, something the other movies would never have done. Nolan is a great director and he takes a great leap of faith by showing perhaps the most important screen superhero in such a way that the city of Gotham and its components don't feel like taken from a comic book, but from real life. Batman Begins is based more on graphic novels and the original characters by Bob Kane, so the realism and details are there without all the fluff and showboating Joel Schumacher would have put out. Christian Bale is perfect as the title character and he creates a more interesting Bruce Wayne than Batman only because we see more of Wayne in this installment. All other roles are perfectly cast, especially Liam Neeson as a mysterious yet intelligent and brutal member of the League of Shadows. Katie Holmes is nice and sweet as Wayne's childhood friend, and there will never be another Alfred as long as Michael Caine resides.Simply put, Batman Begins is worth the time and money. It pulls you into a world you would never expect to see in a Batman movie, than transports you to Gothan City, the rotting core of it mostly. When we do get a glimpse of Batman, it really is quite different than other interpretations. The action here is based more on suspense than violence and the plot moves along quite well to make this movie feel shorter than its 140 minute running time. So, if you are going to see The Dark Knight this weekend, be sure to check this out first. Indeed, if it is anything like this one, this franchise is going somewhere truly spectacular."
21,"Being a fan of Nolan's previous work, I went into this with high expectations, and yet somehow, my expectations were surpassed. My congratulations to the entire cast and crew for making such a phenomenal film.It all begins with the story. Nolan and Goyer didn't just adapt from the comic book, they re- imagined and re-invented Batman and his world while staying true to it. I might even say what they did was in some ways better than the comic book. Things in the comic book that would probably seem preposterous in a live action film are brought to life in an intelligent way, like the reason for the costume, and the reason for the villains and their costumes. I won't go too much into the story, because I think it's best for people to go into this film knowing as little as possible.Christian Bale IS Bruce Wayne, and IS Batman. It will be hard to ever see someone else play the role. The look on his face when Joe Chill walks out of the courtroom... That demonic voice he gives Batman... The way he tries to hide his pain when he's told that ""the apple has fallen far from the tree""... an incredible performance. The rest of the cast is fantastic too, with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman dishing out some great humor.And the film looks great. Gotham actually looks like a real city (with nods to Blade Runner), the lighting is nice and contrasty, and Batman is believable as a flesh and blood character. Even the flying scenes are handled nicely. It's hard to talk about this film without giving things away. If you haven't seen it, please see do. You won't be disappointed. I'd like to thank Warner Brothers for letting an intelligent and talented filmmaker make this film without much interference. Please make more like this one."
22,"Two Words: Batman Begins.The Batman franchise has been resurrected and it is better than ever. I can't stress enough on how good this movie is. Christopher Nolan directed (and co-wrote) a darker Batman that is portrayed perfectly by Christian Bale. A new youth and energy has been drawn out of the Batman legend and displayed perfectly. All of the performances in this movie are stellar, and each one does not seem out of place or pointless. The music keeps your blood pumping with the action and never lets up. And speaking of the action, you haven't seen anything until you see the Batmobile in motion. This thing is mint. I honestly wish that I could write something a lot better about this movie and go into great lengths of describing each piece of this glorious pie; but in all honesty, I will simply ruin the movies for others. I am not one to keep secrets. So please end my torment and go watch this movie. Then I will have people to talk to about it."
23,"Christian Bale is superb in this film, directed by Christopher Nolan. This is the best heroic movie ever produced, and it sets the stage to become the most phenomenal production the world will ever see.Additionally, Christian Bale is the best Bruce Wayne, and Batman I have ever seen on film. Although Michael Keaton was good, Bale exceeds his performance, and excels in this film with epic features and excellency in all aspects of heroism.I highly recommend this film to all, as it may be the best movie ever produced, in my opinion. Furthermore, Michael Caine is a wonderful supporting actor, and he makes ""Alfred"" impossibly believable during the film. He provides character to the Wayne family. Lastly, Katie Holmes makes a great appearance in this film, and has a strong character who tries to fight the impossible growing criminal society of Gotham City."
24,"What a movie,they who have made this movie has got an excellent idea about ""The dark"" man. The other batman movies i did not like,but this is the best ""cartoon movie"" ever!So if you did not like the other movies like me,i highly recommend this film,can't wait to the next film comes to the store!'The plot is genial,i can't understand how the other crappy movies has been made,and P.Bateman is The Batman him self,wounder about who is playing Robin in the next movie.At the end i will also say that this movie are not for kids,scared the hell out of me,and i am a more Saw 1,2 and 3 lover!"
25,"To start off this review I'd like to go back to the original batman series. Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clichés, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman & Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze ""You're not sending me to the cooler"", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it's a shame it didn't start off this way as it might not of died on it's rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it's not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne's past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you've not seen it I don't want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun. D-man."
26,"British director Christopher Nolan is better known for his lower-profile thrillers such as the excellent MEMENTO and the brilliant INSOMNIA, but his first big-budget Hollywood blockbuster is still in the same league as the other two: a tremendously inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking, which breathes a whole new life into the Batman saga and proves to be the best film of the series (shame it took till number five to get it right, but that's life). Nolan dispenses with any previous cast or story lines, instead taking Batman back to his roots, and the result is a tough, violent, realistic adventure which isn't marred by any of the comic-book campness or flights of fancy which spoiled the others. Batman is just an ordinary guy here, without any superpowers, but instead his Bond-style gadgets allow him to become the caped crusader by night.The casting is extraordinary and the ensemble all give outstanding performances. Bale is terrific, finally getting some of the acclaim he deserves; I've been watching this guy for a few years now and he's been great in everything I've seen. Caine is cast as Alfred the butler, and supplies genuinely warm comedy and wit. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are friendly allies, although their roles are relatively minor. Katie Holmes is the attractive love interest and she, too, is surprisingly good. However, it's the villains which have the best parts; Liam Neeson has his best role in many years and is fantastic in it, whilst THE LAST SAMURAI's Ken Watanabe is creepy as a cult leader. Cillian Murphy (28 DAYS LATER) is truly memorable as weirdo bad guy The Scarecrow, whilst Tom Wilkinson is almost unrecognisable as a hardline gangster. Even Rutger Hauer is in it, and that's gotta be good, seeing as he's been stuck in DTV movie hell for a decade.The film is long – 2 ½ hours to be precise – but the suspense and action keep it moving. There are car chases, fist fights, massive battles and lots of other stuff going on. The plot keeps you guessing all the way through and there are plenty of surprising twists. My only complaint is that the action is cut too fast, and too close, so that it's pretty hard to see what's happening, but the excellent soundtrack helps make up for that. Still, a minor complaint with what is otherwise a flawless film – let's hope they all team up to make some more classics like this."
27,"My only criticism of this otherwise brilliant movie is that it is a little too long. But it is an extremely good film, that along with the original Batman could very well be the best of the Batman films(thought perhaps just lacking the original film's sophistication). People may find this blasphemy, but I did prefer this over The Dark Knight, but that was still very good. Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is stylish, dark and gritty, pretty much what Batman should be. I have seen complaints that the film ""contradicts"" the 1989 film. Perhaps so, but what I can say in the film's defence is that Batman Begins is sort of a very loose prequel to the original movies.Visually, Batman Begins looks absolutely incredible! It could very well be the most beautiful visually of the Batman films, with beautiful cinematography and a simply dazzling view of Gotham City itself. Another asset I appreciated was that the music score didn't overpower the action, in fact it gave some atmospheric flavour to it. As much as Danny Elfman's scores were outstanding and definitely memorable, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard do a great job with the score.The script is taut and well-written with lines that really make you think along with some occasional offbeat humour, the plot isn't convoluted or predictable but original, the film moves briskly(the second half was marginally better in terms of pacing to the first half though but that is in no way a flaw) and the action is explosive particularly the climax and the bat-mobile car-chase. Also Christopher Nolan's direction is excellent.The acting, aside from the visuals is what drives the film. Christian Bale is for me the best Batman since Michael Keaton. In the role of Batman he is suitably dark and brooding, like Batman should be, and as Bruce Wayne, he is dashing, handsome and ambitious. Katie Holmes actually surprised me and in a good way. She wasn't bland or annoying, I actually found her sympathetic and surprisingly good. Liam Neeson is also very good, though he has been better, while Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred. Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson and the excellent, underrated Gary Oldman are also solid in their roles, while Morgan Freeman is wonderful as always.Overall, a brilliant film that is visually stunning, gripping and atmospheric. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"
28,"I loved Batman and Batman Returns, Tim Burton's direction and Michael Keaton's Batman were really good, and seemed to be the best we were ever going to get.I'm glad to say that i was wrong, Christopher Nolan has taken the character of Batman to the very beginning, fleshing out the characters of both Bruce Wayne and Batman down to the finest details. Nolan's use of realism in the creating the Batman character makes him more believable than ever.Christian Bale quite simply personified the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman and actually puts everyone else's portrayal in the shadows. Bale is supported by a wonderful cast, including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and more, but i found Cillian Murphy's performance as Dr. Jonathon Crane to be one of the finest in the movie.Overall Batman begins is an very honest, detailed and compelling adaptation of the Batman character, that is worthy of the recognition it has received. For Bat fans and movie lovers alike; this is a must see.9/10"
29,"I've seen all the Batman movies. Most aren't that deeply lodged in my memory. I know that the scene stealers in most of them are the villains. This movie puts it on the strong shoulders of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The movie is about him and his ghosts and his baggage. It is about a man coming to grips with immense guilt. It goes into great detail to explain to us how Batman came to be. It has verisimilitude. The bad guys are, of course, really exaggerated in their evil plans. Everything is neatly plotted. There is fragility in both the character of Wayne and the city he and his family loved. Organized crime abounds and he must face it pretty much alone. I was quite impressed with Inspector Gordon (Gary Oldmann). He was believable and fragile, yet committed to what was right amidst a culture of evil (even on the police force). Like is so often the case, I can't speak for the people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when a movie doesn't follow their dictates; yet, I really was involved in this. This is quite an all star cast with excellent direction with a bleakness that Tim Burton also did well. I think it was one of last year's best films."
30,"I've never had a thing for Batman films. I watched the cartoons when I was about 8. That was alright. Nothing special though. And not to forget...I was only 8. I always thought batman is just not one of those things for me.This film however has changed my mind. I can't wait until the next one! Christopher Nolan presented an almost believable story in this 2:20 hour blockbuster movie. I especially liked the way Nolan described the fear of bats Wayne develops in his youth and the way his father was a big influence in his life. Casting was very good... Normally I would have given an 8 for this film, but because it was able to totally change my mind about the batman theme i think it really deserves a bit higher. That's why 9/10!!"
31,"Batman Begins, the much hyped, much publicised 'reboot' of the Batman franchise is finally here and boy what a treat it is! I was a big fan of Tim Burton's take on Batman, his portrayal of the dark knight as a brooding and reluctant bringer of justice, I always felt fit perfectly with the imagery of the comic books and gave a great feel to the whole Batman mythology. The following outings of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, were less than splendid though. Over-blown campy nonsense with two-dimensional characters being upstaged by a campy over the top rouges-gallery of villains.So here is the re-boot. The beginning. Batman begins breaks from the convention of other comic book films. The first act of the film is told through flashbacks and does not follow a linear editing style. It gives a fantastic insight into Bruce Wayne's feelings towards his origins and his motivation for becoming the Dark Knight. It traces his path from young boy, to troubled young man; unable to vent the anger he feels for injustice he has suffered at the hand of the criminal element.Bruce Wayne attempts to confront his demons head on, but soon realises he is just one man in a corrupt and frightening world. The film takes us on the journey Bruce endures in trying to find what it is he needs to do to come to terms with his past and to guide his future. He travels the world and seeks out a means to better himself both mentally and physically. He trains with masters of martial arts, to learn the fighting skills and mental strength he will require to bring justice back to Gotham. This all provides the very convincing back-story of the transition from Bruce Wayne to Batman.Without giving too much of the plot away, Bruce travels back to Gotham and begins his quest for justice. It shows how he equips himself and the conflict he has within when dealing with the criminals of the city. It also shows what other Batman films have failed to show. The trouble of living a double life when you are a billionaire playboy. Bruce has to find balance between his public image as Batman and his public image as a rich, businessman and socialite.The film climaxes with an awesome final act, showcasing immense fight scenes, brilliant use of the new Batmobile, gorgeous sets and intense acting. The final scenes set the film up perfectly for any sequels and all the while maintains the sense of realism and down to earthiness that Nolan promised.Batman Begins is well written, well-shot and combines amazing special effects, set design and acting to form a perfect final package. This is without a shadow of a doubt, the best comic-book movie I have ever seen. Christian Bale puts in a sterling performance as Bruce Wayne, often reminiscent of his role as a businessman in American Psycho. He is also very convincing of a man driven to fight injustice, a man with a troubled past and a man seeking what he must do to come to terms with it. He is also entirely convincing as the all-action hero Batman, disposing of criminals with his expert martial arts training enthusiasm for justice.The supporting cast is perfect. Michael Caine is an inspired choice for Alfred. There is good chemistry between him and Bale and you are left convinced that they have a quasi-father/son relationship and that Alfred genuinely cares for his young master. Gary Oldman plays a brilliant Sgt Gordon, the last honest copy, torn between misguided loyalty to the force and an honest will to protect the innocent. Cillian Murphy plays a reserved, but entirely psychotic proto-super villain and Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson, as always provide strong character roles. Holmes was a fine leading lady, but I couldn't help feeling she didn't really have enough to do in this film, however only a minor criticism.Batman Begins is a dark film, centred on strong themes of fear, over coming demons of your past and the fight for justice in a corrupt world. Unlike many comic book films, this film is not in anyway aimed at children. It is not strictly adult in nature, but follows intelligent character development, adult conflict and complex portrayals of the characters. Most comic book films introduce your hero as good because he wants to save the world and the villain bad because he wants to take over the world. Then the action begins. This is not the case with Batman Begins, it gives insight into each character's motivation and reasons for their actions, it does not expect the audience to blindly accept anything on face value.Well done to Goyer and Nolan for producing such an awesome movie. When I left the cinema, everyone in the audience was grinning at the end of the film, knowing they had just seen the beginning of something rather special. Bring on the sequels!"
32,"Last night, I went to check out Batman Begins, and I only have one word for the tone of this film: perfect.Absolutey nailed. Blasted out the park. A grand slam.The folks responsible for this adaptation of the Dark Knight simply ""got it."" 100%.Batman is a persona that was created to inspire fear into the hearts of criminals. A creature of the night that hunts from the shadows, strikes without warning, and vanishes into the darkness like a nightmare. The character is never meant to be seen by the general public, he is merely meant to exist in their whispers, an urban myth that is talked about in hushed tones throughout Gotham City.Batman does not have a ""Bat Credit Card"", and he doesn't attend charity auctions or débutante balls. He doesn't drive around the city streets in the Batmobile in broad daylight, waving to cheering citizens. He doesn't have a ""Bat Phone"" that connects him to the commissioner. He doesn't wear a costume with rubber nipples or operate vehicles with spinning neon turbine engines and open cockpits. He doesn't crack jokes like, ""It's the car, right? Chicks dig the car."" All of these things are wrong, wrong, WRONG...and this movie understands that. It understands that and washes all of these injustices away until they are nothing more than a faded bad memory. Screenwriter David Goyer and director Christopher Nolan have given us a film that treats the character with respect; a loud, thrilling masterpiece that doesn't insult your intelligence or bombard you with inappropriate campy antics.Christian Bale gives us a Batman that will scare the living crap out of you. His voice is a gravelly, menacing sound, and when he yells at some poor schmuck to get some information, it's downright terrifying. He swoops out of darkened alleys, hitting fast and furious. He's brutal, cold, and calculating. In short, he's everything that anybody who ever put that cape and cowl on is not. Perfection.The villains are also amazing, but a huge part of their contributions to the overall brilliance of the film is their failure to dominate it. The previous Batman movies were plagued by these cackling idiots in ludicrous costumes who pushed Batman to the back burner. In Batman Begins, we finally get to spend some time with the hero, learning who he really is behind the mask.Not to imply that the villains are poorly fleshed out or inconsequential to the story - quite the opposite in fact. Cillian Murphy is a very effective Scarecrow, turning in a subdued, but intensely creepy performance as a warped psychiatrist who uses fear gas on his victims, unleashing horrifying hallucinations. Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) is a shadowy Tibetian criminal warlord named Ra's Al Ghul, who watches over young Bruce Wayne's training with Ducard, played by Liam Neeson. But things are not what they appear with this situation, and a shocking twist comes into play towards the climax. The rest of the cast is solid, especially Gary Oldman, who finally gives us a competent, intelligent James Gordon. Essentially, the movie is about fear. Confronting it, learning from it, using it, and conquering it. It's a dark, serious film that leaves little room for humor, but some sneaks through in the form of some witty exchanges between loyal butler Alfred (a brilliant Michael Caine), and Bruce Wayne.This movie is awesome and a complete triumph for DC, Warner Brothers, Nolan, and everyone else involved.. Run, don't walk, to the theater. Amazing."
33,"Well, it's official. Batman has gotten his balls back. This film is dark, extremely dark. So dark in fact, there are a great number of scenes filmed, I kid you not, exactly like a horror film. Now, I'm a huge fan of the ""real"" Batman movies. You know, ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" which were done by Tim Burton, starred Michael Keaton, and were carried along by Danny Elfman's rousing musical score. Let's not forget, that old Batmobile from those films. This tank-like monstrous new Batmobile may very well be the coolest car I've personally seen in a movie in ages. Of course, if you're a fan of those rather putrid, embarrassing ""other"" Batman films (Forever & Robin), then you may very well not like this movie. Because it doesn't totally suck like those films did.Basically, this is the story of how Bruce Wayne thought of, created and became Batman. In a nutshell. However, it also tells, in the most personal way, of his struggles with the concepts of justice and vengeance. It shows us how he trained to become the ultimate fighter of evil and corruption. It introduces us to a different villain from the previous four filmsand does a mighty good job of it, too. Even as a side notewe're introduced to good old Commissioner Gordonbefore he's police commissioner. So then, it also tells a bit of his ""beginnings."" We see the beginning of the Batcave and find out just how Bruce Wayne was able to, to quote the Joker, ""get those wonderful toys."" On top of it all, if you ever thought Michael Keaton was the only person who could adequately, correctly portray Batman on screen, you just may change your mind hereI never imagined Christian Bale would do such a remarkable job.Here's the breakdown:The Good:--The action is fast and brilliantly choreographed.--The dark mood is finally backthe way Batman is supposed to beit has even less ""camp"" value than Burton's films!--The Batmobile, as I said, is incredibleand has some great sound effects to boot. Supposedly, it was designed by the same person who created Keaton's Batmobile.--Christian Bale is so good, he almost causes you to forget about Kilmer and Clooneythank god!--Michael Caine's powerful performanceshe's the major player keeping Bruce Wayne's humanity in check. More so than Katie Holmes, whose performance, while good, was a tad weaker than Caine's in this respect. She did an interestingly good job as a tough lawyer, however.--Bits of comic relief here and therethat don't ruin the movie!--Brilliant atmosphere.--Excellent acting all around.--Not claustrophobically over-crammed with ""Batman"" villains like the last two films. The only major villain is the Scarecrow, and another character whom I'll leave up to you other movie goers find out.--Excellent tension.--Fantastic cinematography.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The music is good, but for those of you out there like meyou may miss Danny Elfman's beautiful score.--Gotham City is not as Gothic as it should be. However, the film has slightly more modern twist that makes it more ""believable"" than the previous films. Especially those last two, which, if you haven't guessed it by now, I hated.--Early on, the story deals a lot with flashback sequencesa couple are a bit confusing as to where they belong chronologically. They may have indeed been chronological, but only seemed like a steady story with flashbacks. Still, it gets the point across.--The film seems to be set-up as either a new Batman series, or a prequel to Tim Burton's original Batman. I guess I'd be happy with eitherso long as they keep Christian Bale and don't sell out to that campy crap again.The Bad:--Scarecrow seems a bit underused.--We had to endure ""Batman Forever"" before we got to this brilliant piece.The Ugly:--We also had to endure ""Batman & Robin"" before we got to this. ""Har har, ICE to zee youuu!!"" Ugh!Memorable Scene:--Batman and Scarecrowtalking ""face to face.""Acting: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Character Development: 9/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 (there is none) Violence/Gore: 8/10 (a lot of violence, yum yum) Dialogue: 9/10 Music: 8/10 Direction: 10/10Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 9/10I finally went with a ""9"" over a ""10"" for these reasons alone: Scarecrow, to me, was a little underused; and I missed Danny Elfman's music. If you loved the first two films, you'll love this. If you loved the third and fourth films the most, well then, you sir, belong in Arkham Asylum and apparently hate movies. Everyone elsego see it.(www.ResidentHazard.com)"
34,"yet again we have been treated to a true tour-De-force powerhouse movie that stands very tall with its head held high!!!!!! the only movies that have really got hold of me and given me a real sense of enjoyment (comic strip adaptations this is) is this and the x-men movies.BATMAN BEGINS the movie....the film starts with a young and innocent Bruce Wayne and its not long until you see why he ended up fearing bats they way he did and as the film progresses you get to see the reason why his parents are murdered and what affect this has on Bruce as he grows up full of hate and unforgivingness, as a result Bruce travels the globe in the hope that he will learn to understand the common criminal and therefore know how to combat them, and this is where he bumps into Liam Neeson who teaches him the ways of the ninja and other ways also in combating ""evil"" and you can guess the rest. the trick to this film is that you don't get to see batman at all for about an hour and the wait is really worth it, you get the lot in this movie... humour, sharp serious dialogue, great action, great actors and acting... but again the only down side to this movie is that pesky camera work in the fight scenes and it really annoyed me and made me feel a little dizzy at times, but when you look at the film as a whole you do tend to forgive this one and only discrepancy!!! he he..................9/10 for the film and would have been 10 but for the camera work.BATMAN/BRUCE WAYNE...where has this man been hiding he he, been a fan of bales for a wee while now and i was looking forward to him playing this, but i didn't realise how effective he would be, as the educated and mega rich teenager/business man he pulls this off with such a grizzly swagger and realistic charm you just have to love the guy...i am so glad that Christian bale was aloud to play the character as dark as he did, with so much conviction and because of this you really feel the hate/confusion that runs very deep through him........awesome! 10/10 for me!ALFRED the butler..... has Michael Caine ever been more suited to a character than Alfred??? i find it very hard to find any that come close, the only other one is probably peachy from ""the man who would be king) with Sean Connery, the humour is bang on and really delivers the dialogue with real exuberance and is a delight to watch, witty, sentimental, and has the look of a real butler you could believe to be......10/10 again.COMISSIONER GORDON.....it is very rare when you get a Gary Oldman performance so perfectly played down as this, if you are a regular at the cinema then you will have no problems identifying him but if you're not you could very easily miss him altogether. Gary plays Gordon as the typical family orientated policeman who is just trying to survive in what is a real crap hole of a city in ""Gotham city"" where most of the cops are corrupt and the quality of people living there a quite unnerving to say the least.....you don't get the usual Gary Oldman here and just occasionally i would like to have seen just a little bit more of the actor i know and though i didn't get it i loved his character all the same......9/10 HENRI DUCARD/RHA'S AL GHUL.......Liam Neeson is consistently showing some REAL heavyweight performances in Hollywood at the moment and this is just another feather in that bow, for the first hour of the movie nearly all the best scenes had him in them, and was by far a better villain than any of the other batman villains in previous movies put together....this was a man with real issues and real hatred for corruption and lawlessness and his conviction in this movie made me go WOW on more than 1 occasion he he.....what a towering impression he gives when he is being forceful especially during the sword fighting scenes....awesome....apart from sounding a bit like Qui-Gon Jinn in some spots ( still sounded cool just too familiar if thats the right way of putting it) he was cock-on!! 9/10 MORGAN FREEMAN... though this guy is always Mr reliable he was never allowed to shine as much as you hope for in this, purely because his character isn't that big but what you do get you just know you like... he he.CHRIS NOLAN/ director....well, well ,well! this is excellent directing, the pace of the movie is spot on, the feel he gives you with both the scenery and the dark harsh Gotham city is quite exquisite. you do get lots of shots at like side profile and the use of these angles with shadows over the faces and body positions give you the sense of that you are watching a very dark and gritty movie and right from the get go you know that this is never gonna be like the originals as we know them! the only gripe i have is the use of extreme close up camera work when you get the fights on the go, i know they want you to feel like you're in e the fight but by doing this you lose the beauty of the the action scene and choreography between the actors. because of this i will go 9/10 i hope this is useful to some people and i URGE YOU ALL TO SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE ITS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT......its much better!!"
35,"The movie viewed in Imax screen gives one an unforgettable feeling. The visuals are excellently prepared, locations are out of this world and overall an excellent cinematic experience.The movie surpasses all the previous Batman movies so far produced.The movie has a very faithful story line, may be a little deviation from the comic but nevertheless a very good take off on the original. The screen play has been excellently written and picturised very near to natural surroundings of the magnificent Gotham city.The technological excellence & technical effects are something to be seen to be believed. The Batman suit designed, the way he glides using parachute techs and other gadgets , ammunition and the Batmobile used are all very well brought out convincingly.This Batman movie is really an outstanding piece of cenema, leaving one & all in a great feeling of watching one of the magnificent work, ever produced so far."
36,"This movie is truly inspiring to us Batman fans out there. It's hard to believe that Christian Bale once weighed 130 lbs for one role and then shot up to 220 lbs, before trimming down to 190 lbs for Batman. This man is truly devoted to his work and it shows. Just look at certain interviews about how he portrays the character Bruce Wayne. It's almost as if Christian Bale does research and takes notes on Batman before he starts acting the part out. He makes all the right moves because he surrounds himself with a great group of actors. We can all relate to Bruce Wayne's character in some way and this is where we can thank Bale. Who else could've done it better? BATMAN IS BACK THANKS TO Christian BALE! I just hope the best is yet to come and he sticks with this role."
37,"This is the movie The Hulk wanted to be, and failed miserably - the story of the man that turned himself into a legend. While Hulk failed on every conceivable level, though, this ""Batman"" succeeds.Although comparing Burton's Batman to this one is an exercise in tedium (both are great movies, although they satisfy different types of moviegoers), it may be enough to say that, while Keaton portrays Burton's Batman, Christian Bale is the comic book superhero. Keaton has an edge while showing off Bruce Wayne's strange and weird attitude, while Bale is absolutely amazing while depicting Batman as a man, driven by rage and hatred, who is willing to die to find inner peace.The only weakness I could see was Gotham city. Burton's vision of a future / past Metropolis is unsurpassed - his dark, menacing city is oppressive and hopeless. The new city can't approach the old one's power.Strangely enough, I found the actual ""Batman"" scenes not as satisfying as the whole Bruce Wayne transformation sequence. And the new Batmobile looks as if Batman has gone SUV-crazy - not a good thing (at least to me). Who cares - this is the Batman we thought we had lost ever since Keaton abandoned his mask."
38,"It's been a long time since I've seen the Tim Burton Batman films, heck, it's been a long time since I've seen this one when it first came out. But after seeing all three of the Dark Knight incarnations under Christopher Nolan, I'd have to say that his vision best defines the comic book character that evolved over the past decade. I never cared for the campy Adam West version of the mid-Sixties TV series, and even looking back at the early comic book stories, the appeal of the character was always geared more toward a kid's eye view of good guys triumphing over bad guys. With ""Batman Begins"" the character enters the adult world as a complex hero/anti-hero with conflicting emotions and a motivation in precarious balance between justice and revenge.Before the film came out I didn't know much about Christian Bale, and upon first viewing he didn't seem right for the Batman role, but watching today I think he fits it rather well. The only thing is, I'm put off somewhat by the look of the cowl that covers Batman's face. It's the one thing that hearkens back to a cartoony feel about the character and it's somewhat distracting for me. In fact, the whole idea of a rubberized Batman suit seems antithetical to the the early comic stories where the look of the character appeared more natural. One has to wonder how a real person would be able to move around in something like that.But when it comes to super-heroes, I enjoy origin stories and this one does it right. Beginning with the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents right up through his training under Ra's al Ghul, one gains an appreciation for the dedication and determination required to become a skilled warrior. Not to mention the mental and physical conditioning required to block out pain and exhaustion, an important element in creating the character.In addition to Bale, I found the supporting cast to be quite effective in their roles. Particularly intriguing was Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane. He didn't have as much screen time as some of the other players, but that crazed gleam in his eye made him believable as the founder of Arkham Asylum. Katie Holmes looked a bit young to be portraying the assistant DA of a major city like Gotham, but that could just be me. I liked Michael Caine as Alfred, a worthy collaborator in the Batman mystique and a trusted friend and adviser. All the rest were good too, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, and Rutger Hauer - all exceedingly competent and well cast for their characters."
39,"After being disillusioned by just about every comic book ""blockbuster"" of recent times, Batman Begins comes as a nice surprise. The film draws a lot of visual inspiration from Blade Runner and looks all the more impressive for it. The storytelling is done at a decent pace, giving each stage just enough time to have an impact before moving on. On the acting front Michael Cane as Alfred steals the show serving as the comic relief. Katie Holmes is a bit disappointing but her role is largely forgettable. Christian Bale does an excellent job of re-imagining Bruce Wayne, even if he doesn't look quite right with the mask on. Just goes to show, with this and Sin City looks like Hollywood can do Comic Books....."
40,"OK.. So i don't want to make this long.I went to the Wizard Wolrd Comic Con on Saturday June 4th and they had a special showing of Batman Begins at the IMAX theater in King Of Prussia. Well.. It was Awesome. I am a huge comic book fan and this made me very happy. It is on par if not better then Batman 1.The movie has a scene here or there that is only so so, but you forget about that by the end. Anything they change in history is easy to forgive too because it works so well and makes a lot of sense.All the actors did a great job. I thought to many big names would be bad.. i commend you ALL... i knew Christian and Gary would be perfect and they WERE.. Katie, Michael and Morgan i was worried about (no offense to them, just for the roles) and they did awesome. Katie Holmes actually really did a great job. I gained a lot of respect for her abilities.Overall.. SEE IT.. i would have been willing to pay so much to see it early and getting a free showing made it that much sweeter. I have to see it again on opening night and then a week later for my brothers last night as a free man.. and i cant wait... GET OUT THERE AND SEE IT.. well.. when it opens :) THANK YOU to all who made this movie happen.. you really gave a great film that will hopefully get the taste of the last two (i know.. new franchise) out of our mouths."
41,"Christopher Nolan and crew are to be commended for a job well done. If you are moderately interested in Batman, perhaps enjoyed the first film or two but was appalled with Schumacher's take on the series, you will love Batman Begins for its return to the darker, more serious side of Batman. If you are, however, a true Batman fan (by that I mean you have read your share of Bat comics and genuinely appreciate the character), this film will blow your mind.First off, let me say that Goyer and Nolan do take a lot of ""artistic license"" with the origin story; though is such a thing possible with a story that has been retold countless times? Anyway, there are a lot of new ideas thrown into the mix of Bruce Wayne's struggle - and subsequently, a lot of dimension.The mission of Batman Begins is really very simple - to bring a sense of realism and maturity to the Batman tale.When I say realism, I do not mean it is realistic. How could it be? But the film approaches the subject with the question, ""Okay - what if it WERE possible?"" And the suspension of belief works well.But besides all of that, what is really important about this film? Christian Bale. He MAKES Batman work. Never before has any television or film truly captured the intensity, the ferocious growl, the unstoppable passion that Bruce Wayne has.And this is a film about Bruce Wayne, not Batman. Which is why it works so well.I think this film would not have been possible, perhaps, without Spider-man's birth to the screen. Spider-man revolutionized superhero movies, gave some credibility to them. It showed the world that, in order to make a movie about a superhero, you have to instead focus on the alter ego - the real person.But Batman is a little trickier than Spider-man, I think. You see, the twist to this character is that, the Batman IS Bruce Wayne. Wayne the billionaire is the mask. Perhaps this seems a little simple, but the film really takes a hard look at it, and shows us two different Wayne's. This Batman does not require his costume in order to be Batman.There's a wonderful scene that shows an interaction between a little boy and the Batman. Batman attempts to stay hidden as he clings to a building in an alley, spying on a villain attempting to get rid of criminal evidence. The boy emerges from his beaten down apartment, parents yelling at each other in the background. He looks out on his rugged balcony, then catches a glimpse of the Batman - right next to him. Instead of rushing off, Batman just kind of shares a moment with him, silent at first, and the boy says with hope, ""I knew you were real. No one else believes me."" Bruce watches him a second longer, then hands him a device from his belt and disappears. This wasn't the cheesy, super-hero interacting with adoring fan type scene. It was almost like two kindred spirits, the hero feeling the child's pain and reaching out to him. The thing that is so wonderful about this version of Batman is that, while he appears heartless, he's actually full of compassion. And it isn't just the dorky super-hero type ""calling"". It runs in the family. We learn in the film that Bruce's great grandfather helped slaves escape to the North during the Civil War. We see perhaps one of the deepest renditions of Bruce's father, Thomas, as being a strong, compassionate and loving father, who's saying sticks with Bruce all his life: ""Why do we fall? So we can pick ourselves back up."" Michael Caine does a riveting job as Alfred, much more masculine (in a gentlemanly way) than past incarnations, a bit more youthful and definitely more agile. His fatherly influence warms the heart and makes us treasure every second with the character (though it might just be because of Caine, who is a phenomenal actor). Think of a ""Second Hand Lions"" type Alfred.Then there's the love interest (if you can call it that), Rachel. Honestly, I understand why they put her in here, but she really has no point to the story. She's not the reason he becomes Batman. She doesn't stop him from being Batman. She's just kind of there, a convenient voice from the past. Really, any of her scenes (aside from the kiss at the end) could have been given to Alfred, and it would have worked better. But being that she's actually such a small part of the film, it doesn't bother me that much.I won't go into the villains, because I can't say much there without giving it away. I will say, though, that they are again, very much based in realism, not in comic color poetry. There are a wide variety of villains in this film, and at the end, the promise of one very special foe in the sequel.This film ends on a definite note of continuation, as even the main titles suggest it (the title ""Batman Begins"" doesn't even flash until the last scene has rolled). But it works, because you knew that was coming anyway, right? Personally, I feel this film is a much more mature comic book film than Spider-man, Superman, Fantastic Four, X-men, etc. will ever be. While not realistic, Batman Begins is BELIEVABLE, and I will definitely be frequenting the theaters quite a bit this summer to see this movie again and again."
42,"This film is absolutely Outstanding! Its nails the character,the world he inhabits and everything around him Beautifully. I couldn't have hoped for a better and more cinematic experience. To call batman begins the first perfect batman live action movie would be true but a complete understatement. This is still easily one of the greatest comic book films of all time and the most thorough origin story that I have ever witnessed. The film explores everything that previous live action incarnations either never could or never thought to. The first thirty minutes of the film don't feature Batman at all but instead the audience is acquainted with Bruce Wayne as both a child and as young and troubled man. He is portrayed by the amazing Christian Bale. The audience develops a Intimate bond with him the way that we have never seen before. The rest of the cast is absolutely magnificent. Liam Neeson is brilliant as Bruce Wayne's martial Arts master. He inspires Bruce when he is at the most vulnerable point in his life. The training sequences in the snowy mountains are some of the most memorable parts of the movie for me. What impeccable screen writing! Michael Caine was born to play Alfred. The relationship between Alfred and Bruce is beautiful. You can tell that Alfred is the closest thing that Bruce has to a father. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman is beyond excellent as Jim Gordon. Finally the character Gordon has a say so in these movies. Cillian Murphy is Fantastic as the evil Scarecrow/Jonathan Crane. The weakest link in the film is Katie Holmes but she still does a good job for the most part. Her characters relationship with Bruce is very engaging even if she doesn't have much chemistry with Bale. Also she gets to deliver one of the best lines in the film ""Its not you who are underneath but what you do that defines you."" The film is gripping unlike any Batman story that you have ever imagined. The film is dark and gritty but not merely for the sake of being dark and gritty. This has a meaning story about a young man who uses a fearful symbol to exact vengeance on the criminal underworld. The character grows and matures as the film progress from a victim of fear and tragedy whose world was falling apart to a fully fledge unstoppable hero that makes the criminals fear him. The Hanz simmer score is masterful and in my humble opinion the best ever put in a batman film animated or live action. This movie is a masterpiece and underrated by fans of its slightly superior sequel The Dark Knight."
43,"I still remember going to this movie and having no Idea what I was about to see. A buddy of mine wanted to see it, and I knew absolutely nothing about this movie. I went with expectations to see something along lines of another Batman movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger making a second appearance.Boy was I surprised. From the start I was hooked. This was like no other Batman I had ever seen before. It was not cheesy jokes, cheesy sets, cheesy cast, nor cheesy costumes. This was done Dark, and Dirty, and real. Well as real as a fiction movie about a super hero can be. You could say it was 100% plausible. This movie was the second best movie of the trilogy with the Dark Knight being first.But this movie was more important. It was the game changer the led the way for the Dark Knight."
44,"You know the story, you know the outcome, but nothing is lacking here. Thank God, even Rutger Hauer underplays his part - how good is that? The cast is perfection (yes Katie Who? does a fine job) and I won't mind looking forward to the sequel, the remake of the sequel, whatever they will call it. Bring the Joker on. Makes a real case for the fact that the right cast means absolutely everything. This is entertainment and comic book characterization come to life. Christian Bale's Batman makes Ben Affleck's tortured Daredevil character look absolutely ridiculous (sorry, maybe that is really not giving Christian enough praise - he deserves all he gets). Since we are in for a few more years of comic books as movies dominating the scene, I vote for more like this - made for adults, not children, with superb casting, and Hans Zimmer (with the help of Lisa Gerrard, maybe Moby, and the like) scoring the music. I felt that in no way was I cheated here - unlike so many other movies that I see where the corners that are cut are bleeding so profusely that you can't help but notice. See this on the big screen. Worth every moment."
45,"Well, first off, I must say; Bale, as mentioned before, is perfect as Batman. His acting performance in the movie is just outstanding, therefore my high rating. The movie itself, plot, dialogs and so on, its nothing out of the ordinary, but then you start to think about those 90's Batman movies. This just seem more realistic, more ""Bruce"" than ""Batman"" and with the perfect acting from Bale, it makes all other Batman movies look really dull and daft. They managed to put in a few funny lines as well, Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman gave the movie that extra ""casual"" yet serious, although funny touch to it all. I am impressed, more Bale, more Batman! Continue in style.danrozen,swe"
46,"This, the first part of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is as much about how and why billionaire Bruce Wayne became Batman as what he does once he has; in fact he doesn't don the bat suit until an hour into the film. In the prologue we see a young Bruce Wayne fall into a well where he is terrified by the bats he disturbed; creating a life long phobia. The first time we see him as an adult he is in a Himalayan prison; he is released and invited to train to become part of an organisation called the crime fighting organisation; League of Shadows. Upon completing his training he learns that the league's methods are radical in the extreme... they intend to destroy Wayne's home city of Gotham and everything in it because they believe the world needs to be cleansed of its corruption. Gotham is indeed a corrupt city but Wayne is determined that it can be saved. He returns home and uses the resources of Wayne Industries to create his Batman persona.This takes almost to the half way point of the film; in the second half we see him start his fight against those corrupting the city; the first person he goes against is local mobster Carmine Falcone; he may be the city's best known mobster but unbeknownst to him he was working for others; the psychiatrist Dr. Crane used Falcone to smuggle psychotropic drugs into the city; he used these to experiment on patients at the Arkham Asylum in preparation for the attack on the city being planned by the League of Shadows. If Batman is to thwart the League's plans he will have to confront his deepest fears and risk losing everything he has. He has few allies; just a policeman, Sgt. Gordon; his butler Alfred; Assistant DA and childhood friend, Rachel Dawes and demoted company researcher, Lucius Fox.Before watching this put any memories of the camp '60s TV show or the '80s films out of your minds; this is a complete reboot that is in no way connected to them and tells the story from the characters beginning. The first half of the film is less action packed as it deals with how Bruce loses his parents, struggles to come to terms with that loss and is trained by the Henri Ducard of the League of Shadows... this doesn't mean this section was any less interesting; in fact I found this to be an essential as it gave us the necessary insight into Batman's motivations rather than just expecting the viewer to accept that Bruce Wayne likes to fights crime dressed as a giant bat. The second half is packed with plenty of exciting action and it is fun to see some of Batman's famous gadgets; especially the new and imaginatively designed bat mobile. The gadgets aren't overdone though; he doesn't always have just the right piece of highly specialised kit!The cast is full of top quality actors including Christopher Bale as Bruce Wayne, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman and Rutger Hauer... but it doesn't feel like an 'all-star cast' film where everybody gets a chance to show off; each of the cast plays their part well without overplaying it. This has a far more realistic feel than previous Batman films; the villains are entirely human without over the top mannerisms or camp costumes and because so much time was spent introducing the Bruce Wayne character he is the real character and Batman is just a costume he wears and even that is given a practical justification. I'd certainly recommend this to fans of intelligent action films; even if you don't usually like superhero films this one is worth checking out."
47,"Anything I say about this film will sell it short. I was originally skeptical when I saw the Urban Assault Vehicle in the trailer, but my fears were calmed when I saw it in context. Everything about this film is perfect - the acting, the directing, the mood, the plot, and all else. It is rare to see such intricate storytelling mixed with bone-shattering intensity in the action department. And fans of the comic will not be disappointed with this apt translation.I hope Chris Nolan directs all future Bat-movies, because his lighting and architectural canvasing was so perfect, it outdid Tim Burton's interpretation (which I previously thought impossible). As of this review, IMDb has rated the movie #117 of all time, and I agree completely. This film has universal appeal. Christian Bale is perfect as Bruce Wayne, Katie Holmes actually acts for once in her career, Liam Neeson is the quintessential villain. Other stars shine brightly. I can only hope that Crispin Glover becomes the Joker in the sequel. Highest possible recommendation..."
48,"I was lucky enough to have seen the premiere of the movie on Monday evening and I was very impressed. This is easily the best Batman movie I have ever seen. This movie completely disregards the previous 4 Batman movies and begins its own franchise. The scenes are dark and foreboding, as is Batman himself. This film makes the previous 4 Batman films look as campy as the old TV show. There are no wild costumes or over-the-top freak characters. Scarecrow's costume consists of nothing more than a burlap sack yet it is more effective than the ridiculous outfits worn by Mr. Freeze or The Riddler in the last two terrible Batman movies.The movie is outright action. The fight scenes are realistic in that there are no stupid one-liners being dropped during the fight, nor does the fight pause for one of the characters to crack a cheap joke. Christian Bale is the best Batman I have ever seen. The supporting cast is incredibly strong; with especially solid performances by Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Liam Neeson and even Gary Oldman (who I have been very critical of in the past). I hadn't seen much of Katie Holmes before this film, but her performance was every bit on par as those of the seasoned veteran actors mentioned above. Lastly there is Cillian Murphy, whose performance reminded me of the chilling characters played in the past by Christopher Walken. I can see Murphy becoming a much bigger name in film in the near future.This was not a children's' movie in any way, though the film is not overly violent or gory. I don't recall seeing any blood at any point in the film. I saw many parents bringing children to the premiere, but I believe these people were expecting a movie like the previous 4 that added corny jokes and enemies that bordered on slapstick with their appearance.The movie distances itself immediately from the others by showing the audience a different version of Bruce Wayne's parents being murdered. The origin is told well and gives us a much better insight on the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman. This Batman is realistic. We see how he is trained and hear what his beliefs are. He even bruises and looks athletic without looking TOO big to hide his appearance when not in costume. I applaud Christopher Nolan for breaking out on his own and not submitting to the campy formula of the other movies.I would gladly see this movie again in the theater. It looks to be the best film of the summer and easily the best film I've seen this year. Because there is no sex or gratuitous violence the film is okay to take the kids to, but don't expect them to be as entertained as they were with the previous films. At no point does this film even pretend to be targeted at a younger audience."
49,"""Batman Begins"" is the best batman film made so far. While Tim Burton's 1989 movie is already a box office classic, Batman Begins has all of the gritty power that made Batman famous in the first place. Chris Nolan has done what Tim Burton and Joel Shumacher couldn't do, which is make a comic book film true to the actual comic. While Nolan's direction is amazing David s. Goyer's script is great. The film starts with a tortured Bruce Wayne traveling the world, when he meets his soon to be mentor Henri Ducard played by Liam Nesson. his training wins him a spot on Ra's Al Ghul's League of Shadows. Bruce decides to pass on the proposal and heads back to Gotham. Soon we see Bruce transform into a fierce hero bent on cleaning up his city.The film's supporting cast including Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine make Batman Begins far more than just a kids movie. The only mediocre part of the film comes as Katie Holmes's performance as Rachel Dawes. Other than that, this picture is worth watching over and over again."
50,"Finally, after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader, the Batman franchise is back on track. Having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the Dark Knight, I was especially disappointed by 'Forever' and 'Batman and Robin'. To me, these film lost the essence of what drives Bruce Wayne to do what he does and turned Batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero.Thankfully though, Nolan has gone back to the roots of the character, portraying a confused and angry Bruce Wayne, who ultimately rises to become Gotham's greatest champion. Don't expect to see loads of shots of Batman in this film though. It is the story of Wayne and focuses mainly on his years of training and preparation for becoming Batman. You are almost teased throughout the first half of the movie, waiting to see the excellent Christian Bale in the costume, as it keeps holding back to keep you in anticipation. When Batman does finally turn up on screen, it is well worth the wait. In my opinion, Bale was born for this role and for the first time when watching a Batman film, I enjoyed the scenes of Wayne being Wayne as much as Wayne being Batman.One of the strongest features of the film, is the way that it manges to suck you in believe that a 'Batman' could be a reality one day. The technology is current, with no use of silly OTT weapons and gadgets, again making the film work by today's standards. Plus, we are not allowed to forget that Batman is still just a man under the costume and there are times when he gets a bit of a kicking and shows that he can be vulnerable too, something we sometimes forget when watching a superhero flick. Gone too, are the silly villains!!! Jack Nicholson was the perfect Joker but from there it went downhill. Thankfully, in this movie the bad guys are actually fairly 'normal' and manage to be menacing at the same time.Which finally brings me to the cast. I always had high expectations for this film when the cast was announced. Let's face it, what a line up! Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katy Holmes, Ken Watanabe and Tom Wilkinson are not to be sniffed at. Even an old favourite of mine makes an appearance: Rutger Hauer! Awesome. Actors of this calibre would never have gotten involved in this project if they didn't have faith in Christoper Nolan's talents and thankfully they took the leap...For the comic book fans out there, waiting to see this movie, let me assure you that you won't be upset. Imagine the darkness of the 'A Death In The Family' and the 'Year One' story lines. I have never met a fan of Batman who didn't love these books. Well, this is the kind of Batman you can expect from Bale: Dark, brooding and tortured by his past, yet the hero we have come to love. For those of you who are not comic fans, then just look forward to seeing how Batman should be. This film is a credit to Bob Kane's original vision and a testament to all the talented artists and writers who keep the legend of the Dark Knight alive in the comic books today....Thank you Mr. Nolan and thank you Mr. Bale. In fact thanks to everyone who worked on this film. Batman finally Begins from here...."
51,"Batman Begins was a massive breath of fresh air when it came out in 2005. Coming 8 years after Warner Brothers jumped the bat, as it were, with Joel Schumacher's childish mess, ""Batman and Robin"", Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins brought a maturity and seriousness to The Caped Crusader that had been absent since Tim Burton left the world of Gotham. While Batman Begins might not boast the visual prowess or rich villains of Burton's two Batman movies, it fleshed out the character of Bruce Wayne in a way no movie has since.Batman Begins is an origin story straight through, detailing Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) emergence from tragically scarred child to a symbol of heroism and darkness. After training with Ra's al Ghul and the League of Shadows, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham in perfect mental and physical shape. What Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer do perfectly here, is inject Bruce Wayne with an emotion never before seen in a Batman movie. You can feel the pain and grief Wayne is experiencing and you can see why he decides to become a living symbol of good. The first full origin story for Batman on film, Batman Begins is very much told from Bruce's point of view. Earlier Batman movies often focused more heavily on developing the villains, leaving Bruce Wayne in the shadows. The approach that keeps Batman a dark, mysterious figure is a valiant one, and it makes sense. However, context rarely hurts, and Batman Begins provides the character with heaps of context. You can clearly understand the emotions and motivations of the man behind the mask. The origin is also utterly believable. You can see why Bruce Wayne dresses like a bat, why he needs a cape, how he gets a super-car and super-gadgets, and why he hides in a cave. Does it strip Batman of his mythic status? Yes, a bit. Luckily, unlike Nolan's two follow-ups, Begins doesn't get too carried away with realism, retaining a comic book style that its successor would forget.While it does take a while for Bruce Wayne to fully become the bat, it is worth it. Once Bruce Wayne finally dons the cape and cowl, there are a few jaw-dropping action scenes including a brilliant batmobile chase scene and a thrilling climax on Gotham's elevated trains. The atmosphere and feeling of Gotham City is nearly perfect in it's own way. It does not have the Gothic beauty of Tim Burton's Batman universe, but it's blend of comic book dinginess and contemporary sleekness makes Gotham a terrifically realized cityscape. The city feels like what a comic book world would be like if it actually existed. Batman himself is a dark, brooding, wonderfully realized character in his own right and he shares the screen with an ensemble of great actors. Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon are standouts in an ensemble cast that is playing the comic book material straight as an arrow. Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow is an excellent but criminally underused baddie, but on the whole, the supporting cast elevates the material.Batman Begins is still as fresh today as it was more than a decade ago. The origin of Batman is engaging, engrossing, and emotional. The story provides a context to the Bruce Wayne character that elevates the movie beyond its fun comic book plot. The origin is a satisfying and believable one, and once Batman finally enters the scene, the action is unmatched. Batman Begins is a strong, confident summer superhero blockbuster with more maturity and emotional truth than most dramas. I hesitate to call it the definitive interpretation of Batman (Batman 1989 takes that title), but Batman Begins is the best of Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, a film that balances gritty realism, human drama, and thrilling comic book fun.85/100"
52,"A plunge into the depths creates real fear, as out of darkness swarming beasts cause to appear, later at, the opera, you start to tremble, shake and cower, leads to an exit, where the price is quite severe. Some years later and a journey is begun, from the light into the shadows where you run, as Ra's al Ghul becomes mentor, or is he just, a tormentor, the cycle closes, returning to the forsaken. A new friend is made and doors begin to slide, finding technologies, to halt and stop the tide, tools to fight, the criminals, mobsters without principles, a winged vigilante, in Gotham City, now resides."
53,"I've just come back from a preview screening of Batman Begins. I went in with low expectations, despite the excellence of Christopher Nolan's previous efforts. Talk about having your expectations confounded! This film grips like wet rope from the start. I won't give away any of the story; suffice to say it mixes and matches its sources freely, tossing in a dash of Frank Miller, a bit of Alan Moore and a pinch of Bob Kane to great effect. What's impressive is that despite the weight of the franchise, Nolan has managed to work so many of his trademarks into a mainstream movie. The story does not progress in linear fashion for the first half, and there are some truly spectacular hallucination scenes. Parents thinking of taking their young kids along, think twice. When we left, a terrified 8-year-old boy was being comforted by his parents. Some of what's up there on screen really is the stuff of nightmares.Of the cast of Brits chosen to bring this American tale to the masses, Christian Bale convinces in his dual role, while Michael Caine as Alfred comes up with the humour just when the film is in danger of taking itself too seriously. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson provide able support, as does Morgan Freeman. Most refreshing of all is the way that Nolan and co have come up with a way of bringing comics to the screen that does justice to the often adult source material in a way that, say, Daredevil, tried and failed to do (although the director's cut is better). If the Dark Knight doesn't return after this, there's no justice."
54,"Director Christopher Nolan is rebooting the Dark Knight with a ever darker style. It is faux realism. He starts off with the death of Bruces' parents. After not able to kill their killer, Bruce is in a Chinese prison where he meets the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul. It is the anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi. His message is a dark perversion of Justice. When he returns to Gotham, he invents Batman.There are two things that keep this from an even more impressive start of Nolan's Batman Trilogy. The first is Katie Holmes. She is not up to the task. She is still playing that little girl character from Dawson's Creek. She doesn't have the seriousness or gravitas to play this gutsy lawyer character. It's a big character, and not just another girlfriend.The second is that Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) isn't a big enough villain. The evil plan has too much of a silly Bond feeling. It is too unrealistic in a Batman movie that is suppose to be realistic. It leaves a bad taste for the climatic ending. Other than those two, this is still a great start to the trilogy. It sets the tone for the final two."
55,"Forget all that colorful, candy coated, over-the-top, comic book style trash that poisoned the last two Batman movies. Joel Schumacher should be embarrassed for creating Batman Forever and Batman & Robin which became the ultimate low for the character since his creation in 1939. This new film thankfully has nothing in common with those embarrassments. Batman Begins is a prequel to everything we have seen before. It takes us back to young Bruce Wayne as a boy. The film has a very dark, gritty feel to it. In fact, I found it hearkening back to Tim Burton's unique style found in the original Batman movie with The Joker and Batman Returns with The Penguin and Catwoman. If you liked those then you will love this new one. I think it is even better.Without ruining it for those who haven't seen it the new Batman Begins shows the transformation that took place from young Bruce Wayne to Batman. It truly recaptures what the original story about Batman was meant to be. You witness the initial training, the beginning of the bat-cave, the early gadgets, and of course crime fighting at its finest. All of this is carefully executed to keep your attention and entertain you without overloading you with special effects and other Hollywood tricks. I dare say it may be the best Batman film ever made. Sequels are on the way of course."
56,"This film is by far the best superhero film to date with maybe the exception of V For Vendetta. It is a fantastic reinvention of the genre none the less. Christian Bale is absolutely brilliant in this he owns Batman in this film he shows how Bruce Wayne became Batman and shows the emotions behind his crusade. He makes Bruce Wayne the main character not Batman. This realism is what makes the film so revolutionary it is by far the most realistic superhero film I have ever seen. Batman doesn't defy the laws of physics, Gotham isn't an over blown fantasy it looks as it could really exist in the states and the villains aren't fake people there real criminals. The cast is brilliant and its not dominated by American's with the exception of Holmes and Freeman. The main cast, the major characters are all British/Irish brilliant actors none the less. The writing in this tale is also masterful as it is heavily influenced by Frank Miller and other Batman comics. This is a film you need to see however you can."
57,"What we see in this movie is the ""dark & gritty"" (TM) Batman, which was introduced by Frank Miller in 1986 in the comics mini-series Dark Knight Returns, which was an alternate future version of Batman. But Miller also gave the ""real"" comics Batman the dark & gritty treatment in the seminal Batman: Year One story, which is perhaps the greatest Batman story ever created (also because of the effective artwork of the excellent David Mazzuchelli), and which chronicles, among other things, Bruce Wayne's initial (pre-Batman) martial arts training in a remote mountain region. In the comics, a creative force as strong as Frank Miller was bound to yield massive imitation by less original comics creators - and so the early 1990s saw the Batman character getting consistently and increasingly dark & gritty, to the extent that the entire Batman universe was based on that darkness and grit.So the question is, does this work in a movie? Well, in my opinion it didn't even work in the comics, so, no, for this and other reasons I don't think it works in the movie, either. I always preferred the pre-Miller Batman, whose comics were driven by the stories and not simply by mood and style.Batman Begins is not a bad movie. It has many good things. The story has lots of great ideas. Most of the changes to the Bat-mythos were thoughtful and effective. I even loved how the Batmobile had to jump over a moat every time it left and entered the Bat-Cave.Unfortunately, the movie is atrociously directed. Everything is much, MUCH too dark, and considering how bad-looking the terribly cut fight scenes are, the fast-moving action and scatter-shot dialog are particularly grating. Most characters beside Bale's and Neeson's don't have enough to do, or get no significant characterization. Oldman's Gordon is wildly underplayed, and I could never separate Michael Caine from Michael Caine, which I needed to do if I were to find him convincing as Alfred. I think the structure and editing of the movie was terrible, and the decision to make a comic-book movie so dark that you could hardly see what was going on, was a monumentally bad one. It was a decision made, no doubt, to emphasize the medium of the movie over that of the comic, and it made the director attempt to create some kind of art movie - and apparently many people feel he succeeded. I didn't.And I thought the special effects were another big problem. There were too many of them. Why did the plot need a hallucinogenic drug, so faces could twist and horses could breathe fire? Because, I'm certain, the movie-makers felt they had to deliver the special effects spectacular that they thought superhero movie audiences have come to expect. A commercial decision, thus, to blow some dough on unnecessary SPX, just because the audience probably would think it was a cheap and unimportant movie if it didn't have any. So, no, I was not impressed at all; rather the opposite.And unfortunately I have to make one more serious complaint. Ra's Al Ghul was very cool and very well played and everything, but his scheme was ridiculous in the extreme. Through centuries and even millennia his ""league of shadows"" (the actual size of which is never shown) would destroy civilizations (oh, or just cities) at the height of their decadence, like God striking down Sodom and Gomorrah. And now they'd decided that Gotham City should be destroyed? I'm sorry, but I find it ridiculous on at least three levels. First, wouldn't they target more than a single city? What use will it be to destroy one city? But, of course, this would depend on their man-power, which we are never made privy to. Maybe they're just, like, twelve guys. It certainly looks that way. Second, Ra's had been planning to destroy Gotham for, like, twenty years or more?! So, basically, he's been focusing all his resources on just Gotham for at least two or three decades, while events in the rest of the world has had no bearing on the situation? That's preposterous. And third, where's the sense in going in to help exacerbate the decadence and crime and corruption before delivering the death-stroke? They are totally becoming the very thing they would destroy. And sure, they're the bad guys and all, but shouldn't their scheme have SOME modicum of logical coherence? Apparently not. So anyway, not a great, successful movie as far as I'm concerned, but the typical commercial fluff with a hurried narrative and a holey rusted plot, Batman.6 out of 10."
58,"I never thought Christian Bale could displace Michael Keaton as the best batman, but, sorry Michael, the deed is done.Batman fans should find no surprise in the darkness of this tale depicting the early life of Bruce Wayne, his transformation into The Batman, and one of his most harrowing adventures. I avoided reading reviews before seeing this. As a lifelong comics fan, I felt this film deserved an open mind from me. After seeing one of the trailers, I became convinced that this film was going to be based on Frank Miller's The Dark Knight, a legendary take on the 1930s Batman origin story inked in the 80s by the man who later gave us Sin City. But no, this is a fresh and original Batman film, including the significant elements of the original, but adding its own very carefully thought out embellishments. While it has all of the darkness of The Dark Knight, it has all of the plot elements of the original, and more.The familiar Batman story is told early in the film, but by the time we are allowed to focus on Wayne, he has grown into a young man. Wayne is depicted as a troubled drifter whose traumatic early life has left him seeking understanding in all of the wrong places. Bayle plays the character to the hilt - with his detachment, repressed anger and heavily depressive tendencies sustained throughout the entire film. Susceptible to any guidance that might provide him with a chance to right the wrongs he has seen, he falls under the spell of Ra's Al Ghul high in the Bhutanese Himalayas and becomes an apprentice in the League of Shadows - a secret society of ninjas who purge the world of corruption in a merciless manner. Wayne's martial arts training is where the major story arc begins.This is easily the most serious, intelligent, and adult of the batman films. It is well filmed, relentlessly fast-paced and intelligently scripted. Batman Begins also sports a phenomenal cast. I am aware that a few people felt that Katie Holmes was miscast as Rachel Dawes, but I couldn't agree less. She did a good job as, basically, the only woman in the film. The rest of the cast did not miss a beat either. The very likable Michael Caine makes a great Alfred, though I have to admit I was concerned when I first saw him on screen (having never gotten over some of his weaker efforts).With Sin City and Batman Begins coming out in the same year, it is easy to imagine that - after decades of struggle - the comic media has finally successfully broken into serious commercial films. Let's hope it's here to stay!"
59,"This is probably the best Batman movie to date, because it wasn't flashy like Joel Schumacer made in the last two. Also it wasn't extremely dark like Tim Burton made the first two. The cast lived up to my expectation which were very high, like they all for all movies. Now George Clooney sucked as Batman, so did Val Kilmer, Michael Keaton was good, but Christian Bale rocked. He had the charm of Bruce Wanye, and the badassness of Batman. Michael Caine as Alfred was just so genius, and putting Morgan Freeman in the movie was just amazing. He (Morgan Freeman) was just so great.So all in all I highly recommend fans and non-fans to see this movie, you will be amazed at the depth of the story and just the pure greatness of the way it was crafted."
60,"First of all, I have to say that I enjoyed the previous Batman series, directed by Tim Burton for several and then by Joel Schumacher. As good as that series was, this start of a new series would fall flat if all it does was copy the last one.But this series (and it will be a series it seems) certainly has its differences. It was less fantasy based and more realistic. To be sure, Batman still does some pretty amazing things. But this time, at least some of it seems more believable. At the start, Batman even loses a few fights - at least as Bruce Wayne. And he even seems to have a few fears. And Gotham City, almost appears to be similar to a real city. This Batman is more realistic, somewhat similar to the Spiderman series that is also going on. In both cases, the audience knows that the hero is still human and actually has a chance of losing and is concerned about that.This realistic approach works, and works well. Not only did our group greatly enjoy the movie, but we are very much looking forward to the next ones in the series. The acting, casting and direction were well done. And of course the action was both creative and fun - as one might expect.The premiere that I went to see was not as crowded as one might expect. However, those people that were there stood up and applauded at the end of the movie. One seldom sees that."
61,"I don't worry and obsess too much about 'superhero' flicks. I just expect them to suck and take what enjoyment I can from them. So the relatively high quality and watch-ability of ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" was a great surprise to me, since I had fully expected them both to be lame, camp, and stupid. But instead, both flicks were well made films with warmth, dignity and humor, as well as being pleasant tributes to the memories of decades of entertaining stories and the comic book creators who made them.""Batman Begins"" continues this great tradition. It manages to include almost everything the fans love about the character and his alter ego - the cape, the gadgets, the Bat-Mobile (more of a Bat-Tank, but still), the urban backdrop, the disturbed and disturbing villains. And it does all this while still being a crackerjack movie - the quality of the production, the acting, the soundtrack and the cinematography are Sky high.What's really wonderful about this version of Batman is that there are some major Hollywood actors involved in this, but every one of them treats the material with gravitas and respect. But at the same time, no one chews the scenery or over-does the drama. Neeson and Caine are especially great in this respect. No one can instill dignity and humanity into a potentially silly or goofy scene like Neeson.(Hell, he almost saved 'Episode One' all by himself.) Here, he just punches the humanity and also 'larger than life' quality of the proceedings into the next level. And Micheal Caine is, well, Micheal Caine. He's effortlessly wonderful as Alfred, as good in his way as Micheal Gough was in the previous versions of the franchise.I think it is obvious that while Tim Burton is a wonderful, whacked out visionary (and God Bless him for it), Nolan is in fact a better director for this more naturalistic material.I was very pleased to learn that Christian Bale would be the new ""Batman"" - after watching him in ""American Psycho"" and in ""Equilibrium"", I was pretty sure that he would have just the right qualities for the part - he's built like a brick, and he's got the 1000-yard stare and the 'lights are on, but nobody's home' qualities that the character demands. And man, he is good in this. Micheal Keaton is a wonderful actor, but Bale seems to have been BORN to play Batman.I can't give this a perfect '10', because it's a superhero flick, for crying out loud. I save '10' for stuff like 'Bambi' and 'Deliverance'. But this is really, really, really good."
62,Batman Begins is starting a new generation of Batman movies. This one if the best and it gave such a great beginning story to what happened to Bruce.Christian Bale gave a very good performance. He is a good Batman and I hope to see him continue with other Batman movies because he has proved himself to be one of the next leading Hollywood men in this time.The supporting cast was excellent too. Michael Caine gave a great performance as always as the Butler. He really brings energy to a movie.Morgan Freeman too is good as always but his part needed to be bigger. He is one of my favorite actors and I thought he was good in this movie too.Kate Holmes. She is another cute and sweet actress that I personally love to see in films. The not so good reviews First Daughter I thought was a good movie. She really has a potential too.Batman Begins is not to be missed. It is a good film and I am waiting for the next one! :)
63,"Ever since Batman Forever this franchise has gone downhill. But if there was a movie made to resurrect it this was it and boy did it do its job. Everything you like about movies is in here. Great acting, amazing effects, a rich plot, and having a cute Defense Attorny helps too. I don't care what people say, Katie Holmes getting engaged to Tom Cruise didn't have anything to do with the success of this movie. She's just a good actress. Christian Bale is THE Bruce Wayne and always will be (except for Adam West of course). Michael Caine is a great Alfred too. The Scarecrow is the greatest psychological bad guy since Norman Bates. All in all anyone who wants to spend 2 and a half hours enjoying themselves should check out this movie. But for people who aren't fans of the books should wait for the rental."
64,"The movie focuses on Bruce's childhood where he gets his haunting memories from. It shows how he was to become the prince of Gotham, but things do not turn that way. How he wastes some years of his life and then suddenly how he understands the aim in life. The movie certainly satisfies the viewers that how he actually becomes a batman, and from where he acquires his skills and the stuff which is required. Well if this is a beginning of a ""james bond like series"" then it really is a very good start, otherwise, well it certainly does not cover the whole part of the story. I can say that in comparison to the other ""such movies"", the movie starts a little slow, but for fans like me, who think the more explanation the better, I can say that is this movie is much better off. Well, to be critical some of the objects in the movie do not conform to the actual comic book story, but for a part like that, I suppose they cannot have a thing like that in real. Other than that, a few details are also messed up, but then depends on how well you have read those comic books. On the whole, I can say for fans who just cannot get enough in just 2 hours out of good movies, this movie (and its sequels) are just extravagant."
65,"The action sequences are tedious, overlong and boring. The whole nonsense with the ninja gang in Asia is a jumbled ridiculous mess. Best part is the assembly of the batman stuff, but the car is also a very uncool contraption. The long car chase scene with is pointless. Katie seems lost. The first 40 minutes or so goes by rather slowly and is of little interest. The fight scenes are not well done, difficult to see what is happening, and of little interest.This is a potentially good indicator movie for me, and I really need one, with the high percentage of loser movies coming out nowadays. If a critic loves this I can chalk that up to poor judgment.While Mr. & Mrs. Smith is totally mindless it is actually a lot of fun, is exciting for most of it."
66,"A well made action film, especially of its sort, it constantly tackles below surface ideas, such as justice, fighting crime, fears and corruption, while at the same time the film offers exciting action on the surface. The visual effects are very effective, and the overall visual style suits the project very well. Cillian Murphy is worth noting for an intriguing performance, even if the rest of the cast members only act adequately. The film is somewhat slow to build up, focusing on some of the story elements for too long, but once the film gets going, it is superb. There are certain imperfections that one generally accepts in these types of movie blockbusters. Yes, the on screen romance is dull, but at least here it is not a useless subplot. Yes, some of the characters are inserted just for laughs, and not to add anything to the story. Yes, even some of the necessary characters have pointless moments of comic relief. Yes, the special effects tend to go over-the-top here and there. However, do all these points really matter? If you are expecting a flawless masterpiece then they do, and you will not find such a film here. But, if you just want to see an action film that is a cut above the rest, this is a great example: a film that is engaging both below as well as above the surface."
67,"I enjoyed the movie, and I thinks it is worth of the good rating in IMDb. The plot was good enough and I even liked the first half of the movie. But here and there there were things that just felt wrong, here is a short list from the top of my mind (and from the worst to the least):1. Close combat scenes. It was very hard to understand what was going on, wobbly camera, darkness and fast multi angle cuts adding to the confusion. Almost as bad as in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Only reason I can think is that Christian Bale didn't wan't to learn to act hand to hand combat. But in most of the battles he is wearing the bat-mask (and fighting masked enemies) so they could have used a stunt double to do the dirty work. Go figure, maybe it's just a close-combat directing fad.2. Microwave-machine that can vaporise water many yards away... ... but vaporises nothing water based (blood, anyone?).3. Undestructible Bat-tank Running through 20 inch concrete wall that is designed to stop vehicles from running through it (being in between of the lanes...). No way something that flimsy could do that, no matter how high-tech it is. Can't say for sure but I think it even went wheels-first to the walls. Some wheels there. And it wasn't even made to break walls, but to jump over rivers.4. Tricycle-Bat-tank There is a reason wheels are usually located in the sides and near the corners of a vehicle, it's called stability. And if it was meant for for rough terrain bridge building, no wonder army was not interested. That thing would topple over at the first sight of a slope.5. Gun in a courthouse Bruce was able to smuggle a gun in to a courthouse in a crime-infested town? I can understand the assassin (bribing and all) but Bruce? Maybe he did some heavy bribing off-screen.6. Grapple-gun Okay, just a minor rant here, it is one of his trademark toys so no way to exclude it from movie no matter how ridiculous it is. Rest of the Bat-suit and accessory was well portrayed (maybe excluding the bat-throwing-stars), even the armor was told not to be bullet proof."
68,"It seemed the past few years many things began ... again. Yes Superman returned, but it was a beginning too. Batman begins is one of the best efforts of this latest craze that emerged. And the director is playing a key part in this.Christopher Nolan is of course not the only man to ""blame"" on the success of this reinvention and of course re-birth of Batman (after part 3 and 4 you could be excused, if you thought it was over for Batman)! Where the new Bond (21st installment) was about to throw away the complete history of Bond as you knew it, Batman ""just"" reinvented the style of the two first movies. Yes I liked the first two Batmans, but I do also think that Nolan's Batman is better. Beginning by the costume (completely dark, instead of having something yellow on his chest, that would be like an easy target to shoot at) and goes on, with the man behind the mask. Beautifully played by Bale, who is supported by a great cast! A great drama with action in it ... what do you want more?"
69,"Wow... I really wasn't expecting much of that movie, but I was really impressed. Of course, Tim Burton is not behind that one, so it's definitely not an ""artistic"" movie like Batman I & II, but the cast was great and I thought that the plot was really good. Christian Bale is definitely convincing, and with Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy (oh my god, so gorgeous!) and Gary Oldman (funny, I didn't recognize him...) in the same movie, I don't really know who else we could ask for, they're all simply brilliant! The movie is pretty long but time passed really quickly, and I liked the alteration of action, jokes and deeper stuff, like the introspection that is bound to happen. I only rated it as an 8 and not more because there's a point where you have to compare that one to Batman I and II, which were both 10 in my opinion, and this one just misses that artistic touch that only Burton masters... I don't want to say more because every batman fan (I & II at least) should see this one, and I really hope they like it as much as I did!"
70,"I'm a huge Batman Fan...not in an over-driven anal way, but I did want to see how much popcorn I could fit in my not overly large mouth, even if this meant suffocating when I watched (blocked out) the travesty of Batman & Robin and the case of over exposed nipples...Batman Begins is a fantastic film...for everyone...except those under 12! Warning 12a! Blah...Christian Bale is Fantastic and just what the Dark Knight should be Brooding, slightly mental, Dangerous with a sense of humour. The cast in fact is brilliant from Gary Oldman to Rutger Hauer (kudos to Liam Neeson)...and even though Katie Holmes is in the ""thankless"" role of ""woman needed any will do"" she too excels (doesn't get in the way).The settings are visually pleasing, from the ice caped mountains to the neon-dark Gotham (nice train) and the music too is effecting and complements the film perfectly.I urge all to see this film it is one of the few ""summer movies"" that won't induce popcorn-eating contests to pass the time (though they can be fun)My enjoyment of this film didn't even waver when the screen went totally out of focus and everyone sat in our very British manor waiting for someone else to notice.:) This of course is just my humble opinion."
71,"Christopher Nolan undertook the difficult task of bringing back Gotham's savior and managed to pull it off in style. Nolan's tribute to the 'Caped Crusader' is a clean break from the twentieth century franchise that included Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney donning the mask of the great DC comic detective. The chiseled Christian Bale takes on the mantle of the 'Dark Knight' as Nolan delivers a gritty, edgy and, dare I say it, more realistic Batman than his predecessors, who inadvertently ended up making a parody of the superhero and his exploits. Bale delivers a troubled and dark Bruce Wayne who in is complexity is more credible then the Bruces of the past. As Batman, he fits the mold although his delivery could use some work.Cillian Murphy is far too pretty to play an arch villain like 'The Scare Crow' who, surprisingly, didn't pose much of a threat and would be laughed at if considered a true nemesis. On the other side of the tracks is the world's favourite girl next door, Ms. Holmes, who still looks like she belongs at the creek. Though their efforts are both apparent and commendable, they still come across as children caught up in a game for grownups.Michael Caine brings emotion, humor and charm to the character of Alfred the Butler as is Gary Oldman believable as the helpless but good, Sergeant Gordon. The original Hitchhiker is back too, with Rutger Hauer's convincing portrayal of the ever so sinister Earle who runs Wayne Enterprises until Bruce comes of age.Liam Neeson's performance is the big surprise in this movie of all stars, which also includes Oscar winner Morgan Freeman and Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe from 'The Last Samurai.' The audience can always expect a great performance from Neeson but in this flick he really hits the mark especially with the physical demands of his character. Not to be out done by the other heavy weights, Tom Wilkinson, also an Oscar nominee for 'In the Bedroom, is up to par in his performance as the immoral underworld boss, Carmine Falcone.The action scenes are shadowed by darkness, literally. The audience doesn't get the opportunity to fully appreciate the fights mainly because they take place under limited lighting. On a brighter note, it's enjoyable to see how Bruce Wayne actually transforms into 'The Batman' albeit is at an accelerated pace. With the combination of a worthy Batman, a great cast, a plot that's not totally predictable and a more REAL and gritty feel, 'Batman Begins' is an enjoyable feature that leaves you waiting anxiously for the next installment."
72,"This is an outstanding super hero movie. I had a lot of fun, even though I loved the Tim Burton Batman movies, and did not really want to see this movie made. Batman's super powers are not so super, and the treatment of the mental and spiritual nature is more in depth. I liked the tie between the childhood fears and the batman character. It was refreshing that there was no 007-style comic relief. Top performances by Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. The art direction was solid, but not as great as the Tim Burton films. The movie gets 8 stars because it is a great movie only in its own universe of super hero movies. It does not really tell a universal story--only a story about how a guy becomes a superhero, which of course is make-believe."
73,"Set in the fictional city of Gotham, Batman Begins tells the story of how Bruce Wayne became what he was destined to be. Jumping between Bruce's child-hood to his adult life, then to present time, this movie shows what influences and experiences affected his decision to become the Dark Knight of Gotham, a story which a lot of people don't know. This movie is for anybody who's ever wondered ""Hey, how did this bat guy get to be so good at man to man combat? Or, where did he get all those gadgets and that bat mobile? Or, why did this guy just decide to dress up and fight crime? Or even, why choose a bat?""Now, not being a huge fan of the Batman franchise (especially in the last 10 years) and even knowing that Christopher Nolan was directing, I didn't expect much from this movie. I was thinking to myself ""Oh brilliant! Another Batman movie, another weak idea for a comic book movie, another excuse to make a high budget movie jammed with loads of CGI and explosions. How could anybody possible think they would be able to milk anything new and unique out of a franchise that has been squeezed dry by almost every star of Hollywood and still hasn't had any real success?"" Very open minded I know, but how could you not be skeptical? However, I was most pleasantly surprised. Unlike your typical comic book movie, Batman Begins avoids the temptation to include those cheesy awkward moments and one liners that make you nauseous. But, this movie was anything but typical; it was the most original and down to earth comic book adaptation in years. The storyline actually made sense and was believable, unlike the other movies, it never leaves you thinking ""But why was he or But how can he"" The acting was convincing, Christian Bale had just the right persona to give the effect of a man with a lot on his mind and a lot bottled up inside him. Morgan Freeman was his calm, cool, collected (and very smooth) self. Michael Caine did a good job in his type-cast role as Alfred the butler, and Katie Holmes' performance was better than expected. However, the most refreshing and skilled new actor in this movie, in my opinion, was Cillian Murphy in his role of Dr. Jonathan Crane, who seemed to be the wild card of the cast as he was the only actor who has previously only had cameo roles in films  but he did an astounding job of his role. I am positive we will be seeing much more of him in the future. The directing was superb; the use of lighting and camera angles really gave Gotham that gloomy and dark feel about it. The moral of the film: We fall down so we can pick ourselves up again seemed completely valid in any context and was completely relevant in the film. But the best part was No nipples on the bat suit! Unlike previous installments in the Batman franchise, this is not a kid's movie. It is darker, deeper and more down to earth than all the rest. But it is welcomed by me and I'm sure the majority of the people in this large, movie loving world.Overall I would give this movie 8 out of 10 stars, because at the end of the day, a superhero movie can only be so good. But it is great cinema and it is wished that skeptics (as I was), may give this film a chance."
74,"As the title hints, ""Batman Begins"" is not a sequel to the three (the latest previous attempt doesn't count) recent installments featuring the Caped Crusader, but rather a new dawn that unabashedly ignores any established precedents. The end result is as intended, breathing brilliant new life into a series that had unfortunately become a laughingstock.The script's blueprint invigorates the film. Because of the audience's general familiarity with the title character, ""Batman Begins"" is able to concentrate on his origin and motivations rather than the crime fighting itself. Like ""Superman"", the best superhero movie ever, the film spends a significant portion of its running length on the how and why instead of the what. We observe the fears and struggles that Bruce Wayne faces, which simultaneously humanizes him and heightens his mythic status.This course of action is primarily executed over the first ninety minutes, during which a depth beyond the typical perfunctory introduction of motives is established. Batman's fearsome aura, the source of his power in both the fictional world of Gotham and the real world of moviegoers, is detailed, resulting in a movie more fascinating psychological thriller than standard adventure flick, although the action scenes still shine, one Batmobile-charged chase in particular. Eventually of course the inevitable protagonist-antagonist showdown evolves, and then the movie deteriorates slightly, but by that point ""Batman Begins"" has reached such heights that neither the slight come-down nor occasional cinematic conveniences and niceties (why the kid?) derail the picture.Aiding in the climb to excellence is the best supporting cast of any Batman film, filled with respected and recognizable faces who nail roles as they suitably show more restraint than many in the prior versions. Cillian Murphy is extra creepy as the the shady psychologist Dr. Crane; Liam Neeson authoritative as Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor; Gary Oldman, even though you half-expect him to go psycho at any moment, evokes an excellent world-weariness as Detective Gordon; Michael Caine adds strength to the butler Alfred; and Morgan Freeman as Batman's pseudo-Q is...well, has Freeman ever been anything less than superb? Other talented actors like Tom Wilkinson (crime boss Carmine Falcone), Ken Watanabe (the enigmatic Ra's Al Ghul), and Rutger Hauer (the business head of Wayne Enterprises) round out the predominantly male cast interestingly loaded with Brits. As the mandatory female love interest, Mrs. Tom Cruise...er...Katie Holmes, is fully adequate and attractive, although her part could have been played by numerous actresses.All that talent matters little if the man behind the cape and cowl falters. But Christian Bale never wavers in either portion of his role. I'll say it...Bale is better than Keaton, Kilmer, or Clooney, combining the best of the two former actors. As Bruce Wayne, he surpasses Keaton's charming playfulness and Kilmer's suave businessman with a twinkle befitting the younger man. As Batman, Bale possesses a masked intensity that blows away all of them, embodying the tortured soul through menacing facial expressions and a daunting physical presence that none of his predecessors maintained consistently.Beyond an omnipresent score (from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard) that is unrelenting but still mostly unobtrusive, a solid script and high production value lay the foundation from which the aforementioned excellent work is built. With the feel of a ridiculously polished (as it should be for $135 million) independent film, the Chicago-based Gotham City is edgier and darker than ""Batman Forever"", but grittier than Tim Burton's noir-ish films. Those were bleak by design, while Batman Begins seems to draw its bleakness from beyond mere physicality, from a hope-starved story that matches its dismal yet chimerical backdrop. Instead of the fact-based world of Spider-man and his New York City, Batman and his Gotham sport a fantasy-laced makeover that better allows for distinctions between good and evil. While moral murkiness fits some films (""Mystic River""), superhero flicks work best with clear-cut distinctions. By creating a city with a sense of elevated reality, director Christopher Nolan and company imbue ""Batman Begins"" with a stronger soul that thrives on the film's dominant theme of fear, compounding the movie's allure.All aspects collectively tap into the mysterious and powerful Batman myths better than any other movie in the franchise. We now know not just who and what Batman is, but how and why he exists.Bottom Line: ""Batman Begins"" is the best on-screen incarnation of the Dark Knight yet. A high 8 of 10."
75,"Batman redone. It gives us a new origin of Batman (Christian Bale) and how he got his powers and such. He still plays playboy Bruce Wayne while fighting evil as Batman. His first two villains are the Scarecrow (Cillain Murphy) who produces intense fear in his victim with a gas and Ra's Al Ghul--who trained Batman and knows ALL his weaknesses.OK--it's MUCH better then Tim Burton's dreadful movies but I still wasn't too impressed. I didn't like the new origin at all and it's a full hour before Batman even shows up! It does have good parts--Bale is dead on perfect as Bruce Wayne AND Batman. He also pumped up for the role (we have at least two shirtless scenes). It LOOKS great (if very dark) and it has elaborate special effects left and right (with tons of explosions thrown in too). But I was mostly bored. The training sequence at the beginning just went on endlessly--it was more like The Shadow's origin than Batmans. Also this movie was WAY too heavy on darkness and atmosphere. At one point it was raining and I noticed nobody in Gotham pulled in their clothes from their lines. This isn't nit picking but obviously it was all out there to add an ""atmosphere"" to the scene. Also when you find yourself worrying about little things like that the movie just isn't doing its job (i.e. entertaining you). However Batman's costume, the Batcave and the Batmobile are all explained pretty logically.Acting varies--Bale was just great. Michael Caine (as Alfred) matched him. Even Katie Holmes (a limited actress) was good--too bad she won't be in the sequel (this inexplicable romance/marriage with Tom Cruise is destroying her career). Laim Neeson was very dull as a teacher--he appeared to be drugged out. Gary Olman was (suprisingly) terrible as Jim Gordon--he seems VERY unsure of how to play the role. But Rutger Hauer, Linus Roache (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Bale) and Morgan Freeman were all great.To be totally honest I looked at my watch more than once. I couldn't wait for this thing to get over. All the praise this is getting is beyond me. I give it a 7--and that's mostly for the acting."
76,"I attended the 6:35 pm showing Wednesday (opening) night at a suburban multiplex in Minneapolis. It was a very sparse audience of mostly 50 to 60-year old men, some of whom had dates of equal vintage, which seemed like a very odd audience for this type of film. Perhaps it was the day and hour, but it certainly wasn't the audience I expected. Though better than the most recent ""Batmans,"" this visually impressive actioner fell a little short. In this prequel we learn how Batman came to be, starting with a nightmare. Stuck in an Asian prison at the base of a glacier encrusted peak, Batman-to-be Bruce Wayne awakes from a flashback of his childhood, where he fell down a well and was terrified by swarms of bats. Orphaned when a common thief kills both his parents, Bruce embarks on a personal journey for seven years. Inter-cut with his former cosseted life as the only child of a doctor mogul, is the quest of this current young man, living among criminals in order to understand how their minds work so that he may someday vanquish evil. Now imprisoned for some criminal act, he rather quickly frees himself, lured to the aerie of Ra's al Ghul. There he undergoes ninja training by Ducard (Liam Neeson) who spews aphorisms more akin to Steven Segal than the Dalai Lama. Much mumbo jumbo later, Bruce Wayne evolves into a skilled killing machine, only to reject the role of executioner of bad guys, and membership in the elite League of Shadows, the position for which he was groomed. He burns down al Ghuls house and returns to Gotham to fight evil on his own. Constructing his Batman persona and superstructure with the aid of his wise and loyal butler, Alfred (charmingly played by Michael Caine), Bruce Wayne becomes Bat-man because it symbolizes a fear he has conquered. As he reacquaints himself with Gotham he eventually finds that his father's company, its legacy chairman, most of the Gotham police, and Ra's al Ghul are all tied into the dirty workings of Gotham's king of corruption, Carmine Falcone. When Falcone has the man who murdered Wayne's parents killed to prevent him from testifying against Falcone, Bruce confronts him for fostering corruption. It is then Bruce quickly learns that insulting Falcone only puts those he loves, Alfred and his childhood girlfriend, Rachel, at risk. The conflicts between all parties are satisfactorily entangled in a heinous plot to destroy Gotham, and is then skillfully unraveled by Batman with truly impressive action sequences. But it only gets fun after a long 55 minutes into the film when Bruce finally gets a handle on himself. Until then the film is a bit tedious. But when the super toys roll out the basement of the Wayne corporate office building, the thrills are non-stop. Morgan Freeman plays a wonderful cameo as purveyor of cool technical gadgets, including one helluva Batmobile. Unfortunately, many of the bons mots of the film are lost to poor enunciation on Bale's part. While Caine, Neeson, Oldman, Freeman, Holmes and just about everyone else in the film speaks clearly, Bale lets the words sort of fall out of his mostly open mouth. Only after he dons the slick iconic body armor of Batman does Bale close his mouth and enunciate. Hard to believe the oral transformation was part of the movie's dramatization, but one can only hope. While most of the dialogue is workman-like, spare, and to the point, it becomes almost ludicrous when the characters presume to say something ""deep."" Most notable are when Neeson, early on, delivers his melodramatic utterances, and, toward the end when Holmes proffers the truly incomprehensible gibberish about the Batman person who she loved and might someday see again. On a more positive note, Holmes put in a genuinely adult dramatic performance, which suggests a successful transition from TV darling to serious big screen actress."
77,A new movie and an excellent start to the Batman series from Nola
78,"The movie is pretty great. Is quite brilliant how it explains the way Bruce wayne learned to fight and all the abilities Batman has, where and how learned the escaping techniques and all that stuffs. Its nice to see how he is becoming Batman, and acquires all the weapons the instruments and the bat suit. The bat mobile is quite impressive!! it is not a car, is a tank.....amazing. One of the other thing that really stand out are the characters. All of it has a very well defined paper, and the performance is spectacular. Michael Caine doing Alfred is really good. Christian Bale rolling Bruce Wayne is really good too, but what is most spectacular is that he gives Batman back that darkness he has lost in the last two horrible movies, Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Because that's what Batman is; is a Dark Hero. The only thing that didn't like me was that the person who killed the parents of Bruce wasn't the Jocker, so ins that way they didn't respect the original story."
79,"Tim Burton made Batman look a bit childish in Michael Keaton's figure, and were always beaten by his great villains in both Batman (1989) and the fabulous sequel. But then suddenly Joel Schumacher decided to trash and destroy everything that was cool, stylish and fascinating about the knight of night. So he made Val Kilmer do Batman and topped it all in 1997 by making the horrifyingly bad Batman & Robin that included a terrible Arnie as the main bad-guy.Christopher Nolan, the man behind MEMENTO and INSOMNIA decided making a whole new start to the famous story of one of the most beloved superheroes of all time. BATMAN BEGINS offers a totally new and inspiring gem into the whole Gotham setting. And Nolan ends of his trilogy of psychological settings here; were MEMENTO were lead by memory loss, INSOMNIA followed up with a sleepless Pacino and here he tops it with phobia and fear. And casting Christian Bale as Batman was surely a good move, the former Patrick Bateman looks as his on the edge of breaking all the time, making him intense and pretty scary in his look and atmosphere.We meet down-and-out billionaire Bruce Wayne that's being held in a prison in China. Being a pretty aggressive person he joins the League Of Shadows up in a Himalaya monastery were he's thought totally new skills, but he refuses their methods and returns to his home town Gotham. After his troubled childhood he still suffers from phobia, returning to get rid of the criminality that killed his parents, he dresses in black as Batman and teams up with the only fair people in the city...And Gotham looks better than ever. Not being that peculiar and interesting as Burton's Germanish inspired dark-goth, and not as pathetic and cyber as Schumacher's new wave punk - it looks fashionable but under the surface it suffers from crime and gangsters, violence and cheating. The underworld AND over-world worth remarking, is lead by corrupt cops and laws, mafia bosses that doesn't press charges but shoots you (Tom Wilkinson) and a creepy Scarecrow doing the dirty jobs as a pleasure. In here Batman takes his loop as the dark knight he is and gets allied with off course his best friend, butler Alfred ( played wonderfully by old-English Michael Caine), the policeman (Gary Oldman), Wayne Enterprises R&D man (Morgan Freeman, perfect choice!) and uses his childhood sweetheart (Katie Holmes) just as much as an informant on the law-side as a love interest.And Batman looks better than ever; his dark voice and aggressive attacks leaves old man Keaton and Schumacher's choices as pathetic baby bats. So, flying like a bat and stinging like a bee, Batman's back for business. Filled with great actor performances, amazing action, great CGI, fine dialog and absolutely great settings; Batman Begins is the best Batman movie so far. And one more thing; the Batmobile rocks! Or is it a car or a tanks?"
80,"I hated ""Daredevil"". I didn't like either ""Spider-Man"". The ""X-Men"" movies were mediocre. I can't say that I remember the ""Superman"" movies fondly. The 1989 ""Batman"" was dull. I hated all the ""Batman"" sequels. ""Catwoman"" was abysmal.In fact, by my definition, a superhero movie usually equates to a moronic, silly and childish piece of crap designed specifically to make tons of money with merchandising and Burger King tie-ins.I hate them. I hate them. I hate them.In fact, I resent the genre for angling the entire medium of film toward a younger demographic. Every major release in this day and age seems to appeal at least somewhat to kids in order to capture the massive dollar amount that they generate. I say... ""Fuck the kids""! This is an adult world. They can have it later. That's why I almost always appreciate a film that ignores the 13-25 year-old demographic and delivers a literate and intellectual story about adults and for adults.Okay, that rant is over for now...In fact, the only superhero film I even remotely liked was ""The Hulk"". Not surprisingly, it was the one superhero film that didn't do too well with the younger demographic. It was arguably the least financially successful superhero film in the last 20 years. (Not counting the joke that was ""Catwoman"").So, I finally arrive at ""Batman Begins"", a film I presumed would follow the trend of silliness evident in all the other movies of this ilk.I actually liked it?????? What the hell??????With movies like this, so popular and so familiar, I usually dispense with the plot summary. So I will delve right into the opinions...I loved the look of this film. It maintained the slightly somber feel that accompanies the Batman saga, but it wasn't afraid to venture into daylight from time to time. Heck the first third of the film takes place in the snowy mountains of somewhere or another... I wasn't paying attention.My biggest gripe with comic book films is the lunacy of the plots. I usually cannot suspend my disbelief at all. However, ""Batman Begins"" had me from the get -go. I was buying the story... it didn't seem ridiculous to me. SHOCKING!!!Another thing that surprised me was that the villains weren't absolutely ludicrous. Comic book villains are usually so dumb and over-the-top that I lose all sense of belief. Here, they are relatively subdued... I liked that a lot.The only problem I had with the film was the insanely stupid 'Batman Voice' that Bale chose to use. What the hell was that all about? Very silly indeed!The acting was rather impressive all around... Especially from the supporting cast. Only Katie Holmes left me wanting for more. She was rather dull. I liked the turns by Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman... they brought some added weight to the film. Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy were both solid as the bad guys. And apart from Bale's silly voice, he was a very good Batman... his face carries the emotional weight of the character and doesn't let the character venture too far into camp territory.I will say this though... Superhero movies by their very nature are not capable of a grade in the A-range. It would have to be tremendous just to merit a B+ from me. The silliness of a man bouncing around in a spandex suit with pointy ears just will not allow me to go any higher. But ""Batman Begins"" was about as good as I could have imagined from a film in this genre. I teetered between a B and a B+... but because of the pleasant surprise, I am going to reward it with a B+. ""Batman Begins"" is the best in it's genre because it isn't too silly It isn't too campy. It isn't too childish. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It strikes the right balance. It is geared to a slightly older audience than your typical popcorn flick. I had a really good time with this one!"
81,"To start... I am not a comic book reader and thus will not be making any comment on the history or development of Batman based on the comics. I am purely a fan of the character based off the Tim Burton Films and the old Adam West series that I enjoyed as a child, and the animated series.As the title suggests this is only the beginning. As I am sure Warner Bros. is expecting this to be a hit the movie, it establishes the back-story of the Dark Knight in great detail. I enjoyed the film immensely. If I had to find fault with the movie it would be that I felt the editing was a bit muddled during some of the action sequences, thus making it harder for the viewer to follow the events. I thought the casting was well done and that each of actors talents and personalities fit the character each was portraying.Perfect popcorn eating summer flick....."
82,"I wasn't extremely thrilled with Return of the Sith, and so I went to see this film hoping to get a little more for my dollar since the trailer made it look pretty decent. I've got to say, it was pretty slick. Gone is the ridiculous plot and corny humor of the past installments. This movie has a more serious storyline than its predecessors, explaining the origin and training of the Dark Knight to-be and then delivering butt-kicking goodness. High points are the nearly believable explanations of Wayne's acquisition of technology (suit, gear, ride), the edgy cinematography with abrupt, mid-conversation scene changes, and excellent supporting acting by Neeson, Cain, Oldman, and Murphy. I'd say the low points are the rushed nature of Batman's coming of age, but I guess that's understandable given the necessity for Batman vs. Gotham time the already long duration of over 2 hours. And sorry, but I'm not going to say anything nice for Ms. Holmes because I never was a big fan of hers and I'm already sick of the media fiasco over her and Tom Cruise. Anyway, if you want a Batman movie that isn't as over the top as the last ones and is as believable as possible, this is the movie for you. I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being the top critically acclaimed action flick of the year."
83,"Director Christopher Nolan pulls out all the stops as he embarks on solidifying Batman lore with his retelling of how one Bruce Wayne became the capped crusader Batman. Nolan dazzles in many scenes and is always rock solid, never resorting to cheap humor or unnecessary special effects. This Batman is a dark tale that explains why Batman is the person he is, why he became the person he was to be, and what lies ahead. Christian Bales does a credible job in the lead. He is surrounded by first-rate performers lending their experience and acting savvy: Michael Caine as Alfred(very, very good), Morgan Freeman as Luscious(very, very good), Gary Oldman as policeman Gordon(very good) and villains Liam Neeson(very good), the ever impressive Tom Wilkinson(excellent), and Cillian Murphy(very good). Rutger Hauer is also along as is Katie Holmes(big deal huh?) I really enjoyed this film and was impressed with its cohesiveness and strong script. The script, the direction, the acting, the sets, and the special effects all blend together and make a fine film and probably the definitive Batman film to date. I know many people will compare this to the two Burton films - both good films in their own way. But this Batman is not that Batman. There are no one-liners here and there mixed in with an occasional over-blown scene. This film is a very serious take on a very serious man that has devoted his life to stopping crime in Gotham."
84,"And so the story begins. Well, according to 'Batman Begins' anyway. This is a very long film, but if offers a detailed account of Bruce Wayne's life, and for the first time in the franchise we really get to know the character. We know where he comes from, what motivates him, and understand why he becomes Batman. Bruce becoming Batman is shown in detail, and I enjoyed that.Despite being fantasy, the clever storytelling makes it feel realistic. I liked the idea that Bruce failed on numerous accounts. This showed that - behind the mask and cape - he was still just human, and not an actual superhero with powers. He is vulnerable, he hurts, he falls, and picks himself up again. None of the other Batman films so effectively illustrated the character as a human being. Bruce overcoming his fear is also well done.'Batman Begins' is visually stunning, with a great production design, and incredible action sequences. As with all the other Batman movies, there are more than one antagonist. The first antagonist is crime lord Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). He is then dethroned by antagonist Crane (Cillian Murphy), who - in my opinion - is the film's main antagonist. Then we also have Ducard (Liam Neeson), and even Earle (Rutger Hauer) turns out to be a villain. Too many antagonists for one film? Surprisingly, here, it works well.Batman must stop Crane, who dumps toxins into Gotham City's water supply, and Ducard, who wants to destroy Gotham City. The result is an action-packed thriller that delivers! The film also features a great score by Hans Zimmer."
85,"I walked into the Theatre B showing of Batman Begins hoping for an entertaining show to keep me occupied for the evening. What I received was a superb action/thriller with a good deal of depth and fascinating characters. Unlike most previous movies, Batman Begins avoided odd fight scenes in which the Bat armor restricted movement and instead went with stealth and ambush tactics. This technique was true to the batman character and also more exciting than the old fashioned back to back brawling style. The movie's second villain, Scare Crow/Dr. Crane effectively frightened the audience with his intimidating intelligence and freakishly terrifying illusions. Overall, the cast made a commendable performance and Christian Bale's batman surpasses even Keaton's. Cillian Murphy was perfectly casted for his part as the eerily beautiful doctor who dons the horrifying potato sack mask to literally scare his victims into insanity. Also, learning of the Wane legacy for the first time was very interesting. The only part in which the movie lacks is the films evil mastermind character. The mythology behind him was interesting, but his ultimate death sequence lacked the theatrical elements that had become a trademark of the Batman series since the Tim Burton movies."
86,"Batman Begins isn't another superhero movie in the line of Spider- Man, the X- Men or the Hulk. In fact, even if you don't care for Batman or any of his costumed colleagues, you can still enjoy this film as a good action- thriller. It doesn't thrive on special effects and big action scenes but offers a decent story with lots of attention to character development. The movie is fairly low tech and because it doesn't rely on computer technology in the way other recent superhero movies do, it has an old school feel to it, kind of like an early 80s fantastic film or even Superman: The Movie. Of course, Batman Begins is much darker than Richard Donner's beauty, but the evolution of both main characters from youths, coming to terms with who they are, to caped crusaders is depicted in a similar way. As far as the actual crime fighting goes, this movie puts right everything that was done wrong in Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Our hero's weapons are not covered with blinking lights, but sober and practical: no computer controlled Batarangs, but ninja stars shaped as a bat. No design costume, but military armor, decorated with a cape and mask. The Batmobile is no skyscraper climbing super car, but a rejected army vehicle put to new use that befits the general atmosphere of this movie. Batman doesn't fight villains in shiny outfits who fly around on supersonic gliders or have tentacles as arms. The bad guys in this film are real people: gangsters, a corrupt warden of a psychiatric ward, a martial arts specialist and lots of crooked cops. If you take into consideration that Batman Begins is based on the Year One comics, written by Sin City's Frank Miller, one cannot help noticing the similarity between Robert Rodriguez' newly created world and the one depicted in this movie. In fact, Sin City could just as well be Gotham City without Batman. So forget Joel Schumacher's monstrosities. In fact, Christopher Nolan has even gone one better than Tim Burton and created a credible movie with a good story, realistic characters and the filthiest setting the world's Darkest Knight has ever called home."
87,"I enjoyed the film BATMAN from Tim Burton, though I'll be the first to admit that it was very, very dark and disturbing. I'd also agree that the Batman role in this and subsequent films was a bit one-dimensional--with a much greater emphasis on the villains and amazing cartoon-like scenes. However, despite enjoying the first film, the subsequent films were a disappointment to me as they just seemed overloaded with special effects and were a bit light on character development.In light of this, I really appreciated how the Batman character was hashed out and given much greater depth in BATMAN BEGINS--especially because it explains the long evolution of Bruce Wayne to caped crusader. Christian Bale was very good in the leading role and the story was very unusual but enjoyable to a point--though the plot did get awfully convoluted towards the end. In fact, I would say that the least interesting part of the film was the final conflict at the end, as this seemed a lot like previous Batman films--full of special effects but that's about all.Now my quibbles with BATMAN BEGINS are quite minor and I can't fault the movie too much because it doesn't pretend to be Shakespeare or a contender for a Sundance award! It is just old fashioned entertainment. Not especially deep, but entertaining.By the way, when I saw this film I was amazed at the high-priced talent organized for this film--Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman. In particular, Freeman and Caine were terrific in the film."
88,"Now, I'm no Batman expert, but I do know that the tale of him is supposed to be dark and serious. And if I'm correct, this movie certainly succeeded at emulating that feel. Sure, it isn't Star Wars Episode III, and the first Batman movies were certainly more fun (Batman Returns is still my favorite), although this movie probably was the first to accurately translate Batman to the big screen. Living up to my expectations from the trailers, I certainly recommend it to Batman fans.All in all, I give it a B. The movie ain't no Spider-man, but it was certainly no Hulk either (half exciting, half boring as hell). Christian Bale is definitely the Batman."
89,"At first, when i heard that there is going to be a new Batman film, i thought it would just be another cheap attempt to make some $$$. And so the days past, and i started to be more interested in the story(especially with Chris Nolan as the director). One by one, great actors started to sign on for the film(Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Micheal Cane, Gary Oldmen, Morgan Freeman) and i was all over it. My friends thought it would be really bad and even the great cast and promising trailer didn't really interest them. And then finally i saw the film..... and i was amazed! Chris Nolan has created something other than the Tim Burton Batman we saw in the 80's(and i'm not even going to mention Schumacher's ""2 flops in a row"" Batman). He has made Batman the way he is, dark, anti-social and filled with revenge. Batman Forever and Batman & Robin were flops because the films were too much concentrated on the villains. Batman Begins, however, was centered on Bruce Wayne becoming Batman and defeating his fears. This film is truly the best Batman film ever made, and possibly the best film of this year."
90,"The most well made and mature of all the Batman capers. Probably the first time a comic hero has not been presented like a seemingly inane and kiddish character. Christian is arguably the best ""Batman"" on screen, way ahead of his contemporaries like Michael Keaton or George Clooney. It came as a pleasant surprise to see this six footer enacting the role of this superhero with stupendous control and grace and did not let his fans down in any way whatsoever.Batman has always been a rather mature superhero adored by kids and adults alike and this one time his gray character was brought to the forefront as well."
91,"This movie lot of fun. You should definitely see it if you don't mind canon changes (again, after all, this is DC we're talking about), and/or if you like Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman or Morgan Freeman. All fabulous in this.--spoilers past this point-- I love Gary Oldman. He made this movie worth watching for me. Every time he was on screen, I squeed. And you could tell he was having fun, too. Particularly when he got to use the Batmobile. ;D And they showed his family! I wanna see Babs! (But I'm more than willing to wait.) Things that worked: the training sequences, particularly the final training fight between Christian and Liam, which was excellently choreographed. The idea that Wayne Enterprises was being run by a board, because his father was a doctor in canon, so it was a nice nod to why there was a corporation. Where the bat-toys came from! OMG, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. And he was excellent. ""Mister Wayne...Don't think of me as an idiot."" :D The slow development of Bruce Wayne, depressed and guilty millionaire's son to Batman was just about perfect. Also, Ra's Al Ghul's part in the story was perfect. I had my doubts when I saw that the person playing him wasn't well-known, but trust me...he's PERFECT. Also, I loved that they used Crane/Scarecrow in this very first story. And that for once, the did multiple villains *right*. It ends up setting up everything to come. The final scene with Gordon and Batman on the rooftop (another great line... ""I couldn't find a mob boss""), and his clue for this Arkham criminal Batman's going to have to capture (no, I won't say which. It's obvious when you see the clue, but it's a biggie.) were excellent. Gives me hope for good movies in the future.The bad: I felt rather beat over the head with the ""Fear"" mallet, specifically at the beginning. And they didn't follow through on it nearly enough. They were obviously having too much fun with the car-chases, blowing things up, and other action scenes. Oh, and I don't hate Katie Holmes, but does she have any other acting style? I swear she was just being Joey from Dawson's Creek. Not what I wanted to see. I would much have preferred to see Talia (Ra's daughter) as a love interest. Seeing as how she really didn't do much for the plot, and their ""romance"" was nonexistent. Michael Cane was nice, but felt mostly unused. I would have liked something more for him to do than snark sweetly at still-evolving Bruce.What I would like from the next one? More thought, less action, more plot. One villain (Joker or Two-face would be nice, but not necessary). And a true love interest...who doesn't find out/figure out who Batman is, or even get taken to his cave, k?"
92,"Hit director, Christopher Nolan, brings us another action packed picture filled with special effects. Amazing actors enhance the action within the frames as feelings never felt before are released as you are pulled into the action. All the film needs now is an audience to surround with wonder.The Storyline twists and confuses but also captures and enchants as you follow the life of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and how the tragic death of his parents, affects his opinion on Gotham City. He realises though his experiences how he can make this town a better place. Until his only friend becomes his only enemy, and he feels like the whole world is against him.Gotham City is like no other; with crime ridden streets and dark alleyways, (put there with an intention) it's the perfect setting for Batman's home town. Underground caves surround the grounds of Wayne Towers (Bruce's Fathers business) so secret plans can be laid down to save the city. In these chamber-like rooms with miles a space scientific projects have been stored- never to see the light of day again. Or will they? Michael Cane plays a naturally calm and convincing Alfred. The butler, who serves the Wayne family, adds humour with witty one-liners and a down to earth character, which brings the whole picture into reality. His soft nature is what keeps Bruce from doing what he shouldn't.Christian Bale is extremely talented actor with the skill to comfortably present his character to the audience. Watch his change in character when he is in different situations. This is how the secret of his identity is kept.Heart pacing music creates an astonishing atmosphere to match the high detail and quick moving scenes. Blink and you're bound to miss something! Emotions run riot as you follow with your ears, the intense mood changes and roller coaster story. The clever changes in music tell you what's going to happen before you see it. There is a surprise round every street corner, so be careful you go.Using crystal clear camera tricks and long fast shots, Batman begins is shown in all its glory. Nolan has cleverly followed all the flight, agility and sweeping actions the creature's movement and has captured it on a screen. Quick cuts emphasis the speed of the film and how the story happens in such a small section of history.Overall the techniques used in the film bring it to life and generates a feeling that you are really there, in the one and only Gotham City. Actors' maximise the other features to bring the feature up to and outstanding quality. So much is packed into 134 minutes; every second is worth the attention. You'll be crazy to miss the film of year and probably the film of the decade!"
93,"I would say I did like the movie in general, enjoyed it. What really impressed me thought, was actually the script. I though the script was really well written. Nolan keeps me interested and focused on the movie. Christian Bale was good, but he was too angry and cold, I believe he is a better actor than that. I absolutely loved Morgan Freeman, I think that man never fails.The idea of how justice is subjective, was very intriguing. For some reason I was drawn to the idea of destroying a place that was so overwhelmed with corruption to rebuild it. Even though its too dramatic it felt too real to me as well. It reminded me with Emperor Nero's burning of Rome to rebuild the city.I loved how the movie wasn't just about some action moves, but had many life teaching lessons, especially the first part, before he heads back to Gotham City. The first part of the movie was probably my favorite part. There were lots of good scenes and even more good quotes.I loved that little hint of the joker at the end, though I miss him through out the movie.I was chatting with a friend who said, for some reason he doesn't remember the movie that much, maybe the editing wasn't that good. I think it was OK not very impressive. Visual effects were really good though part of why the movie was quite interesting.Unfortunately Nolan always bore me right before the end of the movie, at some point the action is just taking way too much time and I wan to get to the end of things. Also the soundtracks were good, served the movie well, but didn't feel memorable to me. For me the best one was the movie beginning one, Vespertilio by Hans Zimmer (all soundtracks were of his composition)Overall it is an enjoyable movie, not one of the best I have seen though. Not very sure if it should be on the top250 list.its-lalas-land.blogspot.com"
94,"I really think that Batman Begins has all the ingredients for a good movie. Interesting characters, nice actors, interesting story, yet I seem to be one of the few reviewer thinking that this movie is merely a good movie not one of the greatest movie of all time. This is a pretty rare opinion, I'm well aware but I can't help missing the great hype here. I'm certainly a fan of superhero movies, but this one feels just like a good adaption of the whole theme, not like a movie revolution. Maybe I do prefer heroes which are a little bit more complex or twisted, let's say Watchmen or Iron Man; in that case you might ignore my opinion."
95,"While I wasn't totally blown away by Nolan and Bale's interpretation of how ""it all began"", I think it has its moments. Despite a busy plot where the League of Shadows adopt a broken Bruce Wayne, needing guidance and a path to a better him, train him in martial arts and how to engage, out- think, and outwit the enemy, and attempt to invest their philosophy on annihilating injustice (through whatever means necessary) among other things (dealing with Rutger Hauer's managing of his company, working in weapons which might not have been Pops Wayne's desired property in the business; trying to recover his shaky relationship with Holmes' assistant DA; building his crime-fighting lair, costume, weapons behind the symbol of the bat, what he fears the most due to being trapped in a well as a child; contending with a mind altering drug being used by Cilian Murphy's crazed attorney (he's the scarecrow villain); trying to recuperate from the loss of his parents and the nature of having to live up to his father's honored reputation; learning how to be the kind of crimefighter his father would be proud of...), I think there are distinctive personalities that work. Michael Caine as Alfred (never giving up on Bruce), the butler who has kept his affairs in order, Hauer as the company's chief operating executive in the company (with an obvious interest in attaining power in the company), Morgan Freeman as an old company employee in charge of a section of the company that dealt in ""abandoned weapons designs"" (Bruce's go-to guy for kevlar, the elaborately designed batmobile, among other things), and Murphy (the devious, cold- bloodedness is brought out well; that and he plays a prick, douchebag authentically) all bring it even if Katie Holmes (a target of undeserved vitriol) doesn't quite achieve what the part really needed, and Bale, while brooding and providing enough angst and inner anguish, speaks in that dark tone that has been quite the victim of mockery. Liam Neeson, as Bruce's mentor and adversary, is a bit stone-faced and delivers his lines as a man rooted in his philosophy to the point that when he talks about genocide to an entire city it feels like little more than crushing out ants. The action scenes are sparse, but not altogether satisfying to me. They don't have the pizazz I was accustomed to with Burton. The police chasing Batman in the batmobile, and the effects of the toxin on people, to me, are the film's best moments. Gary Oldman plays it straight in a part that he's seldom seen in...a straight-arrow cop totally in favor of justice. He plays the character with valor all the way. This isn't Romeo is Bleeding Oldman, for sure. Tom Wilkinson even shows up as a gangster running the criminal underground, victim of Murphy's toxin when he threatens to expose the plan to poison the city's water supply. A ton of faces, a lot of subplots eventually converging, and Bruce's developing into Batman: there's no way around a lengthy movie. Holmes, if anything, suffers from not having the right chemistry with Bale, but it works both ways. She just lacks this passion and energy the part kind of needs."
96,"Nobody doubt that Nolan's trilogy is, so far, the best option for those who want to watch some Batman movie and i totally agree with that. ""Batman Begins"" starts it really well, it is a great super hero movie, very realistic and dark, with a incredible well developed story (for a super hero movie, at least).
But it's not perfect.-Why do you think so? - you ask meI just don't see Christian Bale as a good Bruce Wayne, i mean, i think he doesn't inpire that strong personality we expect coming from Bruce Wayne.Another thing that i really disliked about that movie, is how they made Scarecrow look like just an ordinary vilain. I mean, the whole plot is about destroying Gotham through fear, and Scarecrow is the face of fear itself in Batman universe, but here, as i already said, he was just an ordinary vilain, who was defeated by an ordinary taser (???????) and was just working for Ra's Ghul, who was the real vilain of the movie.Despite of that, i really enjoyed the movie, and think it was a great start. 8/10"
97,"After Tim Burton reinvented Batman for the movies in 1989 with his darker and disturbed vision.The subsequent sequels directed by Joel Schumacher got sillier and campier. Also Warner Brothers could not keep hold of their dark knight. The replacements Val Kilmer and George Clooney just did not look right in the batsuit.Christopher Nolan was bought in to launch a new series of films. He went back to basics with a prequel and a reinvention of the character.The first third of the film is an origins film. Bruce Wayne travels the world learning combat and find his purpose in life. He encounters the League of Shadows led by Ra's al Ghul in the Far East. However Wayne rejects their twisted message of destroying Gotham.He returns to Gotham as Bruce Wayne the playboy, his family company being run by an unscrupulous executive.However Gotham is a corrupt cesspit run by organised crime. Wayne develops his Batman persona with the aid of prototype technology developed by Lucius Fox.Christian Bale does his best Clint Eastwood impression when he has his bat suit on. There is enough playfulness in his public Bruce Wayne identity.Batman Begins is a much needed return to form for the Batman movies. In part Nolan takes this opportunity to fulfil a lifelong ambition. Direct a James Bond type action adventure. The finale is very much like a Bond film."
98,"Just returned from my very first press screening (thanks to my movie-geek brother having a football tournament today *g*) - and I've got to say, there's something to be said for seeing a movie without commercials and noisy teenagers Especially when it's as atmospheric as Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan's vision of how the Dark Knight came into being.I must admit right away that I'm not a real Batman fan - I've seen the Burton/Keaton movies and remember enjoying the old TV show, but that's pretty much it. But I was definitely impressed by this movie and enjoyed every minute of it. Christian Bale makes a beautifully tortured Bruce Wayne and his journey towards becoming Batman rang true. Most of the other characters were also perfectly cast  especially Michael Caine as Alfred brings humanity (and humour) to an otherwise pretty dark movie.The only things that can be criticized, in my opinion, are the moments when the movie takes itself too seriously and falls for some clichés, which admittedly are hard to avoid with a well-known topic like this. Also, I wasn't too impressed by Katie Holmes as the obligatory (and way too young-looking) childhood sweetheart/damsel in distress. But that might just be me and shouldn't stop anyone from watching this.Batman Begins sheds some interesting perspectives on Batman's past, especially by introducing some of the familiar faces and names in a manner that didn't feel contrived but improved the story (other than in a certain space saga, one might be tempted to say). Awesome popcorn cinema, with a realistic and yet fantastic feel that draws the viewer right into the dark alleys of Gotham City"
99,"I don't like to comment on giant blockbusters because their humongous fan base usually doesn't appreciate criticism of any kind. Oh well, my rant here contains more 'remarks' than actual criticism, so I'm going to spill my guts anyway. Although a very good film (and definitely a vast improvement over those dreadful Joel Schumacher films) there's something essential missing in Christopher Nolan's reprising of the Batman-franchise: comic-book darkness! Whether intended or not, ""Batman Begins"" doesn't seem to take place in an imaginary world where good battles evil but in a real-life drama setting where every individual has to fight for survival Basically not a bad idea at all, but it's not exactly the ideal setting to have a man flying around, wearing a bat-suit. Bruce Wayne ought to be a superhero but instead he's an emotionally and physically vulnerable man with phobias and no sense of morbid humor. Also, the gimmicks and designs are a lot less exhilarating than they should be. For example: the Bat-mobile here is nothing but a car-tuned Hum-V and Gotham City looks an awful lot like an (even more) pauperized version of New York. Yes, the script is very solid and the cast is terrificbut by no means this ""new"" Batman can live up to the unequaled and blackly ingenious Tim Burton movies that launched the hype about 15 years ago. The film's opening (featuring a young Bruce Wayne on a meditation tour in Tibet) is long and complex but very interesting and a rewarding intro to the new Batman myth. When the story is then transferred to Gotham city, the movie becomes more action-packed and the class-A cast receives the opportunity to show off their talents. I particularly liked Gary Oldman in the (for him) awkward role of honest cop, Tom Wilkinson as the mighty underworld gangster and Rutger Hauer as the greedy and corrupt business manager. I personally found Michael Caine to be unfunny and sophomoric in his role of Alfred the butler and it was sad to see the role of Scarecrow played by a bizarre young nerd."
100,"It had some original stuff that displayed intelligence and thought with regards to his suit, car and weaponry. It did try to dwell on Bruce a lot more and convey some of his darkness but I found towards the end it became very Hollywood-ised. Sometimes filmmakers try to over complicate things and this was a good example.I don't know why they can't have a simple bad guy with a simple plan, why do they have to be so elaborate a plot leaving a growing feeling of inevitability that by the end there will be some big explosions, building destruction, lots of flashing lights and Batman will prevail.The inability of seeing the fighting was immensely frustrating. I don't think I saw him actually land a single punch. It seems a fight scene would be imminent and the makers would speed up the camera, ramp up the bass on the sound, scatter the scene with crunching thuds and smacks but then forget to actually choreograph a fight. Maybe believing that if we heard the thuds and saw some activity on the screen that the audience would imagine the rest and think 'wow, what a scene'. I'd much rather have two or three clearly thrown punches or kicks than 1-2 minutes of whirling cape, bangs and crashes and people falling to the ground.It's a shame that they re-launch the franchise in a blaze of 'this is going to be darker and different' which it certainly starts off doing before descending a little bit into Hollywood banality. Why not have the courage to really shake things up, have the bravery to maybe end it badly (taking T3's lead) or just not conform to the normal formula.Showed promise, had some clever stuff and made more of an effort than some in the franchise but still nothing to rival Batman:Mask of the Phantasm as the best batman ever made in my opinion."
101,"BATMAN BEGINS rejuvenates if totally regenerates a film franchise . After Tim Burton's idiosyncratic vision of the comic strip , the film series became very stuck with the Joel Scumacher version . You wouldn't really blame Warner Bros if they'd ended the franchise there and then due the law of diminishing returns .Indeed it might have been seen as something of a risk casting so many big name ( Read expensive ) actors in one movie . The fact that on its first week of release it only entered the top ten weekly box office must have frightened the studio executives , only to have their fears extinguished where the movie rallied strongly spending two weeks at the top followed by several weeks in the top ten Certainly it's a film that reboots everything that's gone before . It tells the early life of Bruce Wayne while never referring to a need for a sidekick in the shape of Robin the boy wonder . Instead we see some one whose life is ripped apart by murder and is later perceived to be let down by the justice system and Bruce Wayne is not someone who will meekly let this go . In effect Bruce Wayne is now written as a comic strip version of an avenging angel along the lines of Travis Bickle /Paul Kerzey / John Eastland and all your other favourite vigilante anti-heroes from cinema Or at least that's what should have happened . Unfortunately after this motivating incident , which also takes in an involving sequence set in a Chinese gulag the film then starts playing out as a Hollywood Summer blockbuster . In many ways it's like the old blockbusters from yesteryear featuring a host star names and highly regarded not so big name character actors all brought together in one film . The great shame is that most of them are given little to do . It's a film that has a plot written around its set pieces and the characters are just as mechanical . They're not characters like people are in real life , they're generic action hero , generic action hero's sister , loyal butler , stand up police chief who is slightly dumb etc etc by actors who could be have been unknowns . This is a great pity for a film whose reputation suggested to me it was going to be much better than a simple Summer blockbuster/franchise movie Christopher Nolan is a good director , though the recent hype with INCEPTION with claims that he's "" the greatest director of his generation "" might leave him with some baggage . What Nolan has always been good at is editing and continues this with BATMAN BEGINS . The way he inter-cuts scenes is what makes them effective . But at the end of the day it's merely a Summer blockbuster with big names , car chases and the occasional explosion"
102,"The name of David Goyer among the writing credits made me fear the worse. After all those Zig Zag and Blades appallingness you can hardly blame me. So, you may imagine my surprise to discover that Batman Begins is not only better than the previous Batmans but much better. The genesis of the character as well as inedited insights into the seven mystery years in the life of Bruce Wayne makes the whole enterprise engaging even thrilling. Christian Bale is an American Psycho Batman, pouty lips and unexpected sexual presence. Katie Holmes is lovely, with a sharp intelligence and a riveting imperfect beauty. Michael Caine fills the shoes of the butler with wit and charm. Gary Oldman, looking more Oldman than Gary, adds another surprising characterization to his already impressive gallery. So, very nice. There is still hope in hopeless trends. Who knew."
103,"The first time I watched ""Batman Begins"" I can't really claim to have been overly impressed with this origins story, and I remember finding the characters sort of plain and the story equally so.Now, several years later, watching the movie on TV, I am a bit surprised to say that the movie is actually a lot better this time. And the storyline actually had more depth and flavor than I remembered.Christian Bale is unquestionably the best chance for portraying Batman and Bruce Wayne, and manages to take the character and his performance one step further with each successive movie.The characters in the movie were adequate, although the Scarecrow character wasn't really fully utilized, nor given as much time on the screen as I would have liked. And Cillian Murphy was an interesting choice of actor for this role; not a bad choice, mind you. Gary Oldman and Michael Caine are also excellently cast for their roles.Chris Nolan also turned out to be the director with the most interesting approach to directing Batman movies."
104,"This is one of the few movies in which I actually watched the sequel first. Maybe that is why I didn't enjoy this movie as much as the critics and audiences who praised it to no end. While The Dark Knight wasn't perfect, it goes down as one of the best sequels of all time, mostly because the film it is following, was incredibly overrated.I may have mentioned before that I am not a big fan of superhero orgin stories. To me, they have way too much talking and exposition, and the sequels would handle the action, and thus be more entertaining. Now I know that they need to set up why Bruce Wayne became Batman, but do we really need to spend half the movie. I swear 20 percent of the movie is flashbacks. And when action does happen, it's horrendous. The action scenes in this movie are shot so poorly, and edited so sloppily, I can not tell what's going on. Christopeher Nolan is a fantastic director, so why did he choose to shoot the action scenes this way? So sense most of the movie is exposition, and the action scenes are terribly shot, the movie just isn't very interesting.Now, I'm not saying this is a bad movie, for all it's faults, it does do some things extremely well. I did like Bruce's backstory, and found him becoming Batman to be kind of interesting. If it didn't take up 50 percent of the movie, I wouldn't complain too much. I really like some of the characters: Alfred, Gordon, and Dr. Crane. I thought Scarecrow was a much more interesting villain than Ra's al Ghul. The film looks amazing, the acting is good, and there are a few funny lines.Batman Begins isn't a bad movie, it's just not particuarlly entertaining. The action scenes are horrible, and the set up goes on for too long. I admit it doesn't feel too long, and I really like the ending with the setup for a sequel. And I can see why the film is loved by so many people. When it first came out the last Batman movie we got was Batman and Robin.The movie was OK, it was descent. Not one I will watch over and over again, but far from a terrible movie."
105,"The concept here was great-the execution, not so much. It had been ~15 years since I'd seen this movie so it was essentially a first watch for me.I'll start with the good:
The origin story in and of itself is compelling and builds a strong foundation from the very start. I love having context for how exactly Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.The storyline flows quite naturally and builds upon itself, avoiding any drastic leaps or plot holes.The character arc of Bruce Wayne is enjoyable to watch and you feel satisfied as he faces his past and conquers his fears. I also think Christian Bale fits the mold of the Bruce Wayne character they were going for here.Unfortunately, I thought the production quality and direction of the film detracted from the conceptual value.The bad:
Portrayal of Bruce's early years is well-written but the acting is quite poor and the setting doesn't age consistently with Bruce's growing from adolescence to adulthood (this is admittedly pretty nit-picky). The sequences during Bruce's stint in Bhutan and the League of Shadows are corny and shallow, and I have no idea why Liam Neeson was chosen for the role of Ra's al Ghul-just seemed so out of place to me. In fact, there really wasn't a single acting job that stood out as above average in this movie. A few were good, but most were mediocre at best.I didn't find the villains to be effective at all either-Cilian Murphy wearing a knapsack mask and spraying gas into peoples faces? Not my cup of tea.Finally, there were numerous scenes where the dialogue just didn't come across very well, and I think the writing was to blame rather than the actual delivery. Would've expected a little higher quality from Christopher Nolan.Overall, a good origin story that was hampered by poor execution."
106,"Let me start by saying, this movie is not as good as everyone says. I've seen so many reviews praising this movie and calling it the best of the batman franchise. Personally, i completely disagree, i find Tim Burton's Batman to be a much more entertaining and well-written film with better acting. I saw both that movie and this one within a week of each other, so i could decide for myself which one was better. Well, I have to say, Tim Burton's Batman won hands down. I saw a review on youtube saying Batman Begins is overrated, and I have to agree. Now don't get me wrong, it was still entertaining, but i just felt something was missing. Now The main thing that bugged me was the fact that Batman isn't in the movie enough. I know the title is Batman Begins, but that doesn't mean we have to draw out the story of Batman's origin as long as we possibly can. I checked, it took sixty-two minutes for me to actually see Batman, and that just didn't work for me. It seemed to revolve more around Bruce's anger and fear than Batman himself. The movie would have worked better if it was called ""The Times and Trials of Bruce Wayne"", but it wasn't. Another minor problem i faced was with Bruce Wayne himself. For the most part he was fine, but there was one scene that really stuck out to me as being just plain stupid. When Alfred told Bruce he needs to act like a playboy billionaire so no one would suspect anything, Bruce just went to a hotel with two women and let them swim in the restaurant's fountains. Then, he pompously told the waiter he was buying the hotel and went in the fountain himself. I know that's minor but still, he was an asshole in that scene. Scarecrow was useless. I thought for a while that he would be the primary villain, which interested me, but when i found out Raz Al Gaul (i think that's how his name's spelled) was really the main villain, i was disappointed. I thought since the movie mainly revolved around fear, Scarecrow would be more fitting, but they just tossed him aside. They might as well not have included Scarecrow at all. Besides, all it takes is a little zap with a tazer for him to be defeated. That's just pathetic. The fights weren't that spectacular. Half the time i couldn't tell who was punching who. The editing was choppy and many of the cuts were unnecessary. In Tim Burton's Batman, there weren't a lot of fights, but at least they were done well. If i had to choose between Christian Bale and Michael Keaton for my favorite batman, i would have to pick Keaton. Keaton in my opinion was the better actor and proved to me that batman doesn't always have to serious. Besides, Bale's growling voice annoyed me after a couple seconds. But for the most part, i found the movie to be pretty decent. Maybe my opinion would have been different if i had seen it when it first came out (even though i was only 9 or 10 then), or if i had seen it before a saw cinemassacre's review of it. But, i didn't. Overall, it was a good movie, but that's not saying much. It's worth re-watching maybe once or twice or just looking at my favorite parts, but if i do anymore than that I'll get sick of it.Extra note: This is me from two years in the future. Thankfully my grammar and spelling are much improved from my last review. I already explained how I found this movie to be good, but certainly not great, so there's no need to go into much more detail. I just have one more statement to make.The fact that this movie is rated higher on IMDb than The Wizard of Oz is just ridiculous. End of story."
107,"So they wanted to reinvent Batman. And they did it with a mentoring sequence, an evil mentor, a psychological problem, a Q from James Bond movies, a sweetheart from the childhood, good cop, bad cop, a scarecrow as an enemy, a drug to make the city in fear. OK. Good work.(Christian Bale) isn't fit for Batman. I believe that he's a very good actor who got lost into Hollywood. The blockbusters aren't for him, and he's not for them. He's bigger, too serious, and lacking the glamour and the charisma of the action heroes; I didn't buy him in his fight scenes.(Christopher Nolan) tries to pass in Hollywood. So he does a superhero big budget summer flick. Yes, there is a portion of seriousness, with a speech about beating the fear before it beats us, a decayed society, steps the rich people (namely Batman, or his parents) must take to rescue the city. But he didn't give me anything more, anything that belongs to him more than any other directors!Look at the editing, OH MY GOD. It reminded me with an old movie from Honk Kong named (36th Chamber of Shaolin - 1978), one of The Shaw Brothers martial arts movies, where every shot nearly equals the other in time. You read that in (Batman Begins): the average length of a shot was 1.9 seconds. Aside from being too fast, as if the producers did it to squeeze too many events in not too long time, that style tinctured the whole movie with the same color, making the emotional, action, and dialogue scenes have the exact pace and taste. So nothing was special, and eventually I felt that I was watching an exhausting 2 hours trailer!The phase of the lead living in the street wasn't utilized well. The mentoring didn't convince me that he became that able to overcome the entire League of Shadows, and destroy their domicile in no time. Some conversations between the characters were exaggerated and suddenly sophisticated, such as the ones between the lead and his butler, especially the one over having a ""name and reputation"". And (Rutger Hauer)'s character was useless, he was there just to suspect him as the hidden evil boss. So, overall, what I did love wasn't more than some work done in re-writing the world of Batman, and couple of hot action scenes.It's an entertaining fluff, full of stars and explosions, but too hasty and a bit uneven. It feels that (Nolan) was working without much love for what he was doing, or maybe he was new in the industry of Hollywood entertaining fluff. Whatever the case may be, he wanted desperately to have the ""ok"" which, with the money this movie won, already happened. However, frankly, and compared to his work up to 2005, (Batman Begins) was the biggest and the worst movie he ever did."
108,"I've long found the idea of Batman—a billionaire playboy who dresses as a bat to fight crime—just a little too ridiculous to take seriously (and I guess I'm not alone in that thought, given the cartoonish approach taken with the character in the past); however, after the Clooney-Schwarzeneggar debacle that was Batman and Robin, which took camp to a whole new level, a darker, grittier look and feel was inevitable for any franchise reboot.Directed by Christopher Nolan, Batman Begins portrays Bruce Wayne/Batman (played by Christian Bale) in a far more sober and reflective manner than ever before; the script, by David S. Goyer focuses strongly on Wayne's inner conflict between seeking revenge and delivering justice (while neatly addressing some of the character's more questionable issues—most notably, how he learnt to fight and where he gets his cool gadgets from).With a fine supporting cast, impressive production design (Gotham city is suitably gloomy and rain drenched and Batman's suit, accessories and vehicle are impressively utilitarian) and top-notch special effects, I certainly can't accuse Nolan of not pulling out all the stops.And yet Batman Begins still feels strangely lacking. Nolan's fussy direction is partly to blame, the action scenes a chaotic blur of close-ups and quick edits that seriously diminish the level of excitement, but perhaps the film's biggest problem is the simple lack of fun and imagination. Compared with the 80s/90s movies, Batman Begins' new approach feels frustratingly conventional, afraid to be even the slightest bit daring or playful for fear of being compared to its immediate predecessor.I'm not for a second suggesting the reinstatement of rubber nipples on Batman's body armour, but Nolan's grim vision has gone just a bit too far in the opposite direction for my liking.6.5 out of 10, but not good enough for me to round it up to 7 for IMDb."
109,"No disrespect to Tom wilinson, Obviously the name carmine falcone is Italian, Obviously Carmine falcone's Character was an Italian Cosa Nostra Mafia Boss, as I'm sure with a lot of us, Were all fascinated even today when an Italian mafia Don makes an appearance in a TV show or a film. However, With all the Italian-American Actors, why do they have to play a British actor to put on a fake American accent and get him to try and talk like an American Mafia Don ? Why couldn't an actual Italian-American actor play the Italian-American character carmine falcone ? I could understand if there was a shortage of Italian-Americans out there,But there are so many of them, Mostly great actors, just take a look at the Sopranos. Disappointing casting, But i still rate the Movie highly."
110,"Now here's the problem for me. I'd looked forward to this film after some very good reviews and a terrific score at IMDb, but after a while I seriously began to wonder where the emotional heart of the movie was. To be frank, I don't like this man batman one little tiny bit. Of course, we can see how his world was turned upside down as a boy, and the murder of his parents haunts him. But what a cold fish he is. Without a sense of where his emotions are concealed I simply couldn't empathise with him as a passionate advocate of the poor people against the corrupt and the cruel. Indeed, when he is knocking the baddies around I couldn't find much difference between him and them. I'd also heard there was a sense of fun in this film alongside the dark, Gothic sets. So where was it? Humour, passion, dramatic development. All missing. A big disappointment."
111,"Okay, i don't know how this movie got such good reviews i don't get it. First the fighting scenes are annoying because the camera moves too much and you can barely see what they' re doing. Second for GOD SAKE this tow words "" FEAR "" and "" AFRAID "" are almost half of the script , no kidding they say those words more than 50 times on the movie it is really annoying !!!! Oh and do not forget those movement of batman, he basically have the same powers than superman, there are some scenes where he is flying , you don't see him using his stuffs. Katie Holmes had a good acting , even if in half of the time you see her she is like crying or about to. Besides those things the movie has a good story , and the guy that did Batman did good , even if i don't see him as a batman his acting was good. Oh and one more thing God! did you noticed how his voiced changed when he was batman and when he was Bruce when he is batman he has a deep scaring voice and when he is Bruce he has a normal kinda of gay voice. That doesn't really fit"
112,"I have a strange relationship with the Batman franchise - I never really *want* to see the movies, but when I do, I generally enjoy them. I even like ""Batman and Robin"", but that is probably because it has stylistic links to the ""Batman"" TV series of my childhood (campy and played for laughs). Before anyone writes hate mail to me - yes, Clooney was wrong for the role, and the film strays way away from the story as set in the first two films, but I'm not a rabid Batman fan, and taken on its own merits (?), it is no worse than a lot of other films.So, to ""Batman Begins"" - sheer apathy made me buy it on DVD. I wanted something to watch that evening, and I recognised the title, so I bought it. I knew nothing about any of the younger members of the cast (Christian Bale, Katie Holmes - who?), and expected nothing but brainless entertainment. In many ways I was not disappointed, especially in the first twenty or so minutes - all that washed-out rubbish in China or Tibet or wherever, and the thoroughly lousy acting of Liam Neeson reprising his thoroughly lousy acting in ""Star Wars Episode 1"" - that man is going downhill fast! However, I began to buy into the Bruce Wayne character as a result of Bale's acting. He was a nice amalgam of the Keaton and Kilmer versions of Wayne/Batman - there is a strand running through the roles that makes for some sort of coherence.Beyond that, I saw a fairly pathetic supporting cast (Katie Holmes - nice breasts, but can she act?; Michael Caine - ""I always wanted Geilgud's role in ""Arthur""""; Rutger Hauer - ""I don't care what I'm in as long as I'm paid""), a weak story that seems to have been written by committee, and so little light that you can miss whole chunks of action, but I still enjoyed it far more than I expected. Christian Bale may turn out to be a great actor - he certainly carried this film on his own.In general, I have now watched it a couple of times. It could have been better made, the director could have tried to get stronger acting out of the supporting cast, and the story could have been better, but on the whole it is a thumbs up."
113,"I have to admit, I am a fan of the original Batman films, Robin and all. I feel that any other Batman remake or reboot out there would be insufficient to me and would not meet my expectations like the originals did. This is the obvious reason why it's taken me seven whole years to sit down and finally watch the bloody movies (also the fact that I saw the preview for the dark knight rises, and it looked pretty good, so i had to do my homework beforehand).With that being said, the movie is good. It's not as excellent as some have portrayed it to be, yet it is not a movie i didn't enjoy. There are highs and lows to every movie, and this one is no exception.I'll admit, the first half of the film had more lows than highs. Christian Bale was a mopey, drab, depressing Bruce Wayne, someone I found I could not relate to nor enjoy as a main character. I know he was searching for himself and had lost his parents, but his overall dark mood left me a bit cold. While the movie itself was supposed to have dark undertones throughout, overall it was a bit TOO dark for me. Being over-saturated with drama and darkness does not make a movie great - rather, it's the humour (even subtle, made to match a dark movie), the action (or climax, depending on the kind of movie), the relationships and more that are all added together to make a perfect blend. For the most part, I do not feel that was attained.With the second half of the movie though, it reached more of what my expectations were. The action sequences were full throttle and left me feeling revved up, Bruce was much more likable after turning into Batman, some subtle (but very well done) jokes were thrown into the mix, and the relationship between Bruce and his childhood friend (Katie Holmes) was much more believable than it was in the first half. In fact, by the end I was hoping they would get back together in DKR (but seeing as she's not credited for a role, i guess not). Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and Alfred the Butler all deserve nods for bringing in some much needed alleviation from the gloom that is Batman Begins.Overall, stick through the slightly slow-paced and sluggish first half of the film (save for a couple of fight scenes, primarily the one at the beginning), and you will very much be rewarded with the great second half!"
114,"I really, REALLY loved ""Batman Begins."" I thought it was an amazing recreation of the myth established by Tim Burton but ruined by the later, lighter, messy affairs by Joel Schumacher. Batman Returns had a well-structured screenplay, wonderful cinematography, and well-developed personalities and characters. I really, REALLY wanted to LOVE ""The Dark Knight,"" but I just could not. The performances are amazing--wonderful acting. The movie, however, falls flat on some of the technical aspects of the film production itself. Action-packed scenes were impossible to follow. The opening scene of clowns was too long and boring. Batman's excursion into Lau's office building was impossible to follow, either due to editors' shredding the continuity of the scene or simply the scene was played just too dark and too fast. The heroic and intense rescue of the masked hostages suffered from the same fate: camera-work too fast and disjointed and too dark. In both cases, perhaps too much of the action lay outside the camera lens and would have required too much panning back and forth?Then there is the Batman Voice!! And there are so many others commenting about the Batman Voice--including online spoofs--that I know that I am not alone. I just could not understand him, like one spoof asks, ""What,are you gargling marbles?"" My inability to understand the Batman Voice in this second movie made it impossible to understand a lot of the dialogue and therefore some of the core plot developments. Finally, between Batman's garbled voice and the SUPER LOUD MUSIC, it was so hard to hear the last 4 minutes of the movie,even Commissioner Gordon's monologue--the KEY to why Batman is now called The Dark Night. So very frustrating."
115,"Prior to watching Batman Begins i had my doubts. However, they were dispersed in that movie theater. This is a great reboot of the franchise. I particularly like the way it had been made realistic and closer to reality.Of course, we still stay in the realm of fiction, but Batman's gear and vehicles are just a step beyond what you'd see in a typical action flick, even a James Bind movie.The layer that elevates Batman Begins from your average comic book hero is a vague social message. Yet, i didn't think much about it and proceeded watching Bruce Wayne dealing with the bad guys."
116,"This is a solid movie for the beginning of the dark knight trilogy this one isn't so great as the others but still decent to watch the villian was kinda forgettable even it is a classic villian in de comics. The preformance of Liam Neeson as the villian is great , overall this movie was decent but wasn't the best dc movie I have seen."
117,"Batman Begins is overall a good movie but in my opinion it lacks some aspects. First of all the acting and the hallucination effects were good but I didn't like the depiction of Gotham City in the movie. Gotham city was a bit too realistic, I always pictured it as a fantastic, Gothic City not something similar to New York. Also there seemed to be some plot holes as at the end of the movie we don't know what happened to the people who contracted the virus. We don't see whether they managed to effectively mass produce the antidote and the faith of the people of Gotham. The bit in the end about Joker was also a good transition into the original Tim Burton movie. The movie should have had more fantastical elements but director Nolan seems to have taken a more realistic approach to the theme of superhero. Overall in my opinion it could have been better: 6/10"
118,"Is it just me, or was the movie okay? Everyone is talking about how great it was, but it's like they weren't REALLY watching the movie, they were just wanting to be entertained.First off, Batman Year One, is the darkest Batman comic, and this movie is based on that comic right? Well it wasn't that dark. I mean it did have moments, don't get me wrong, but from all the things I read about this movie before and while it was being made, it was supposed to resemble a Blade Runner type look, and follow the Year One series closely. I don't think it did that. They modernized Gotham way too much. And Batman didn't have that intensity he should have when he is Batman. He is a character where you don't know what he is...he's a good guy who's extremely conflicted and somewhat twisted. He is tormented by bats, and by the murdering of his family. He is in true essence a vigilante superhero, but they glorified it to the point where he was just a superhero.Don't get me wrong, it destroyed Joel Schumacher's versions. BUT Tim Burton had a darker feel to it. The look of the film, the coloring, the way Batman acted and spoke. Very short, very brief and very mysterious. I didn't think he was like that in this movie. Also a lot less modern, which gives it that darker feel. ( I mean it was always raining in the movie if it wasn't night time)Another problem I had was the actors. Morgan Freeman is an awesome actor and his character was one that could have been played by an unknown....it wouldn't have mattered. Same with Gary Oldman. I mean there isn't much you could have done with Gordon, but you didn't need an actor of that caliber to play that role.Having Liam Neeson as the villain wasn't convincing enough. He's better as a good guy. He's a great actor, don't get me wrong, but I don't think he's made to play a villain. And then there's Katie Holmes. Well her acting wasn't that great, and she looked to young to be with Bale. Just didn't fit.All in all, they could have done a better job with it, if they made it darker, and used more unknowns as opposed to getting big named actors to play these small roles. If they did it more in the vein of ""The Crow"", that would have been a movie to watch. You may alienate some of the audience, but the true fans would have appreciated it more.Also, if Darren Arronofsky would have directed it like he was supposed to, I think the movie would have been more to what I expected it to be. Like I said, maybe it's just me, but I think people nowadays don't seem to care anymore. Star Wars Episode 3 sucked.........bad acting (except Ewan McGregor)...terrible dialogue......too colorful and not dark enough looking.....a lot of bad scenes....but still people liked it. Were they more nostalgic to see Star Wars again on the screen, and not care about all the holes and such? As opposed to being able to criticize it? I felt somewhat the same with this movie. Oh well...maybe the next one will be what I wanted."
119,"It's reaching a point at which I no longer have any idea of what to make of these comic-book derived superhero movies. The budget must have been lavish. You ought to see Gotham. The glass boxes of yesteryear have become a little more baroque, so that Batman can swing from cartouche to Churrigueresque spatial decoration. Actually, he does do a lot of swinging, as well as zipping up and down, but he doesn't have to. He can leap from the top of a skyscraper and flutter his way elsewhere like a flying squirrel. Somewhere in the silent film archives is a short shot of a man jumping from a platform wearing a pair of wings strapped to his arms. He falls immediately to earth. Batman doesn't. He just make a loud fluttering noise, as of a bat. He also has a lot of gadget and an armor suit and what-not -- not including a gun -- that makes it possible for him to do impossible things.Where did he learn his principles, after his mother and father were killed by a poor person in the bifurcated society of the future? And where did he pick up his mano-a-mano combat skills? And where did he find all those gadgets that make James Bond look like a tyro? Christian Bale got them from a host of first-rate supporting players, including Liam Neeson as his faux guru, Morgan Freeman as the custodian of armor and weapons too expensive to sell to the army, Gary Oldman as one of the few upright police officers in Gotham, and Michael Caine as the ever-helpful Alfred. Every one of them is splendid. Even the villainous parts -- Rutger Hauer, for instance -- are neatly delivered, and Cillian Murphy, as the psychiatrist who has developed a hallucinogenic substance to poison Gotham's water supply, is superbly prissy and haughty. Tom Wilkinson is fine too, as Carmine Falcone, one of the honchos who will bring the city to its delirious knees. I thought I saw John Hurt in the cast, but no -- a dead ringer. Katie Holmes is very nice to look at, with her cherubic face, but she isn't given much to do.There is some mumbo jumbo about ""finding your inner self"" and all that. ""In order to conquer fear you must become fear,"" intones Liam Neeson somewhere in Tibet. But the acting and the Philosophy for Dummies are all distractions for the real star of the movie -- the special effects. They've turned the Batmobile into what one cop describes hesitantly as ""a tank."" The visual effects are overwhelming. They are to the rest of the movie what a wrecking ball is to the abandoned tenement it destroys.If you like special effects, especially those that reveal a city on which the sun never shines, although the rainfall is copious, this is your movie. You'll just have to sit through a little thoughtful advice on how to come to terms with your anger -- and you don't get the girl at the end, either."
120,"This 140-minute film we have here is the first from writer and director Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and if he wasn't considered a top-notch director before already, then this film lifted him up into the elite where he still is today with everybody talking about Dunkirk. But we talked about that one on another occasion already and now lets take a look at the only film from the trilogy that is missing the ""Dark Knight"" in the title. The lead actor in this over 10-year-old film is of course Christian Bale still before his Oscar win and it's not about great acting from him here as it is all about the story. But still for example the likes of Neeson and Caine managed awards-worthy performances. It was a pretty good idea to have Wayne's mentor and trainer become his worst enemy at the very end and it also fits really well with Nolan's dark 0% comedy approach to Gotham City, very different from Burton or West or everybody else. It's almost a catastrophe movie, well with what is happening to Gotham it is and the tone fits in well, also with Bruce's emotional state. I personally could have done without the Scarecrow story as he felt rushed in, but he is also not a character to be a main antagonist for an entire film really, at least not with Murphy playing the character or Scarecrow's looks. Tough challenge. Maybe make the mafia boss or Hauer's character more influential instead with the time gained. Or just make it a 110-minute film.Freeman and Oldman well they were okay I guess, but also as I like them both I expected a bit more. Holmes at least brings in one female character and that's good. But in the center of it all, it is about Wayne making his peace with the past and finding his determination and destiny and like I said the way they used the League of Shadows (Neeson), it was truly interesting in my opinion. People generally consider this film probably the second best from the trilogy after film number 2, but I would say it is my least favorite. That doesn't mean it was weak or anything though. It only means that the other two are better. At the end of this one here, we get a very interesting reference already about a certain clown character turning Batman's life into hell in the sequel. As for this one here, I recommend seeing it in the unlikely case that you still haven't. Only people who really hate superhero films should skip it and it's probably also not an essential watch to appreciate films 2 and 3. I know it is not a superhero film really, but still it is very similar. There are some lengths in the middle part and overlong action sequences, but these style-over-substance parts don't keep it from becoming a quality movie. Go check it out, these almost 2.5 hours certainly fly by."
121,"The movie was OK, just that okay. There's more hype, and build up into this being a rebirth, starting over and being as good or better than the first and living up to the success of other recent comic movies, but that's not the case. The first Batman with Michael Keaton is still the best of the series of these. He looked better, acted better and gave of a better air, aura of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. elements of the first should've been incorporated into this version as well, as it was the most successful. Not, well what they did, without giving anything away. The movie's not a dud though had some good action, and training background info to add to his origin."
122,"I finally saw BB and was expecting great things from the reviews it received last summer. While not a bad film, it didn't have that dynamite punch you expect from a film touted as a summer blockbuster. I found the very beginning confusing and it took me 40 minutes in till I started finding it entertaining and not boring. The beginning is from the title, it shows how Bruce Wayne trained to become a deadly fighter with a secret organization. He goes back to Gothem after being gone years to rid the city of crime. Rachel, the girl he had a crush on, is an assistant DA and one of the few that has not been bought by the mob. The movie shows how Bruce developed the bat suit, mobile,and weapons. And of course he must battle the surprise (though he was gone/dead) villains at the end who want to destroy Gotham with a chemical that makes people crazy.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but not that great story you need to be a big hit. Spiderman was much better with how they showed the hero obtaining super hero moves."
123,"Here we have a film that could have easily gone wrong in so many directions but actually proved you can revive a dying franchise. It had the atmosphere and the cast to give new life to the cape and cowl.However the film was flawed. I guess it varies from person to person as to what they want to get out of Batman, but this movie had everything I didn't want to see and not enough of what I love about the character.I felt there were large portions of the movie, like when Bruce is gathering his resource to make all the bat stuff, that could have easily been a montage and had the same effect. It felt like the entire second act of the film could have easily been reduced to three 2 minute scenes and nothing would have been lost.The first act of the movie and the last act are engaging and exciting. But the loss of momentum in the middle killed it for me. By then end I was trying to get back into the action but I just wasn't in the mood. I think there should have been more focus placed on the villains. The conflict seemed more like a weak device than a real story. I had other problems too (like I didn't much like the costume or the bat mobile and Katie Holmes and Rutger Hauer could easily been cut from the movie with little or no damage to the plot among other things), but most of them stemmed from my knowledge of the comic and its an adaptation so you have to let things slide.Like I said before, the cast is great and the atmosphere is right. The movie had kinks, it wasn't perfect and I don't know that I would say I loved it. It does, however, have all the right ingredients for a superior sequel. So let's hope."
124,"Christopher Nolan. A good, ex-indie director. Christian Bale. Besides Johnny Depp (and maybe Leo DiCaprio), possibly one of the best actors of the newer generation (The Machinist, USA Psycho anyone!?!). Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Rade Serbedzija( plays the bum, I'm a local patriotist, what can I say), Liam Neeson. A whole lot of outstanding actors. Katie Holmes. Hmmmm... Don't know whose idea THAT was... I have only seen the film once, in a lousy, sub-standard cinema so my opinion might not do much justice to BB, but...The overall directing and photography is way above average, Bale and Caine are more than adequate to their roles, the Scarecrow has definite potential...So, what's wrong with this movie? Screenplay. I mean,either Goyer had a frontal lobotomy prior to writing this awful scenario, or he just isn't the man for the job. Austin Powers is a Shakespearian playwright in comparison. Furthermore,Lian Neeson is reduced to a ""No Mr Bond, I expect you to die"" kind of villain, and looks like he and Goyer went on a group lobotomy course. Guess there was a discount or sth. Katie Holmes? I stand before you, speechless. This is NOT to be taken in a good way.And last, but not least, what happened to the Batman theme intro? I understand Nolan's tendency to completely re-invent the series on celluloid, but leaving out Danny Elfman was a grave mistake. I hope they'll rectify it in the next Dark Knight. And put the Joker in it (as hinted in the end), and make lil' Katie die a most gruesome death, and evolve Scarecrow (know I'm boooring, but he has potential),and get Goyer a fresh brain (the one he has is,well, used, chewed and spat up). Rushing into things, aren't I? What to say at the end?All in all, I found BB to be a refreshment to the series. Sure, it's full of flaws (Nolan is not to blame, Warner is), but which Hollywood film of recent production isn't? Sure, the screenplay is a half-witted ""look daddy,I know all 20 letters of the alphabet"" piece of brain-bleach ( I'm referring to the dialogues, not the whole thing), but it's still better than the Billy? Rachel? crescendo in The Ring 2.Nonetheless, when you watch and perceive Batman Begins as a whole, you just might take a sincere liking to it. At the end, it's Batman! *No latex nipples included"
125,"I came into this movie with high expectations, but was increasingly disappointed by the end. There was no one aspect that really annoyed me, but rather a lot of smallish things that seemed to taint the experience. Firstly, I thought that Bale was a wise choice for Batman, although I've never really understood what Bruce Wayne has got to do with a bat, but that's not something you could pin on this movie. Well not completely anyway as they attempt to sort of explain it away with the whole fear symbol thing, and the well at the start - still nuts if you ask me... Anyway, that's not important, what is important is the confusion that engulfs our view of Bale throughout the movie. Some of the worst points being: His relationship with his parents - this is not presented very well, with his memories of his father more likely to furrow the brow than produce tears. Bale's motivations - they are not easily understood - why go see Wilkinson's mob boss after he kills the guy who killed his parents. This seems to be a random or arbitrary way to send him off on his quest. Also, what's the deal with his turning on Neeson and his cronies in such a big way on the spur of the moment? One minute he's learning from them - the next he almost kills them all. A tad abrupt perhaps? And speaking of Neeson and his League of Shadows, or whatever, I'll put it simply - their whole plot is ludicrous. How do a bunch of guys living on a mountain succeed in creating a depression in the biggest city in the world, and why do they think it better that a whole city should tear itself apart instead of live with a high level of crime. Surely they could wield the (unlikely) power they seem to have to improve the situation in Gotham? This leads me to the bad guys as a whole. Being from Ireland I was delighted to hear that the two main villains of the film were from here, but on viewing the film I was a bit let down by the way they were used. Neeson and Murphy are both excellent actors and could have been perfect as complicated modern bad guys, but I think they were let down by the script and direction. I was expecting something brilliant from the scarecrow character when he was shown initially, but it all went downhill after his introduction. All he gets to do is spray Batman with his fear thingy and then capitulate in a random sort of way as the plot comes to an end. Why does he turn into a wet blanket when Batman traces him to the asylum and what the hell is with the scene where he gets tazered while sitting on a horse! Neeson starts out very well as a mentor for Bale, but as soon as he comes back to initiate his insane plan he does not make the same impression. His last scene is also rubbish, bearing more of a resemblance to Speed 2 than a great villain death. Also can anyone tell me why a monorail has so much screen time in the film, I know his dad built it, but it's not that interesting... Possibly my biggest complaint about the film is the style with which they shot the action/fight scenes. It's funny that a much lesser known (and also quite silly) film, that also stars Christian Bale, has endlessly better action scenes. If the fight scenes of Batman Begins were more like those in Equilibrium then maybe I would have left the cinema feeling a whole lot more satisfied. As it is they feel like you are watching a brawl in fast-forward, through the bars of a cage. This must surely have annoyed a few people? Altogether, I got the feeling that a large part of the movie was a victim of committee-thinking. Scenes seemed to pop up out of nowhere as if a spare director had been allowed in on one day of the week. Examples of this were the scene where Katie Holmes' co-worker finds the thingummy in the crate - and is then killed. This had me wishing that they served headache tablets with the popcorn, and was made worse by Holmes' brief mention of it again - to explain why she was so crabby at that time - I mean what the hell!!! Anyway, it wasn't all bad, Freeman was fine as the Batmechanic and Michael Caine produced the only real comic moments of the Movie. I didn't think much of Katie Holmes' performance though, she had no central motivation or character trait and suffered from the wishy-washy style of a lot of the movie. Wilkinson and Oldman were also fine. To finish up I would ask those of you who gave this movie a ten: How can you give ten to a movie that has such a crappy, abrupt and ineffectual revelation scene where Bail reveals to Holmes that he is Batman, and how can you give ten to a movie in which Batman's voice sounds like a 12 year old kid playing in his plastic suit? It was almost as terrible as listening to Darth Vader's ""Noooooooooooo""."
126,"SPOILERS AHEAD I had high expectations going into this movie but was very disappointed by the end. The main critique I have is the fight scenes. I could not tell who was who, the characters were indistinguishable from one another. The fear of bats concept was drilled into your head throughout the movie and could have been done in 1/5 of the time spent on it. The acting varied from great to bad.Bale: Loved him in American Psycho and Equilibrium and figured he was a perfect Batman. But, he was great as Bruce Wayne and horrible as Batman. He tried to speak in a dark and menacing tone as Batman but sounded almost comical.Caine: Good as Alfred and did the most with the character that one would expect.Neeson: His character was too contradictory. He wanted to kill criminals who prey on the fearful but was willing to destroy a whole city who had many good people living in it.Holmes: I liked her in Wonder Boys and Go but she was bad in this movie. When she tried to act tough as the DA it was believable at all. Her love connection with Wayne was only alluded to and they just start kissing in the end out of nowhere.Oldman: I think Oldman is one of the best actors of all time and he was great as usual in a role that wasn't written well for an actor of his caliber. His one liners were good for comic relief also.Murphy: Well-acted as the shrink/Scarecrow but was barely in the movie. His role should have been greatly expanded and Katie Holmes taking him down was a joke.Wilkinson: Played his character well but they build him up the whole movie as the mob boss of Gotham and he is written off as a common thug. Why would a person of his power be present at one of his drug deals? If your the boss you separate yourself from the deal as much as possible.Freeman: He basically did this for the money. A great actor who did a minor role for the big paycheck."
127,"(Nearly) perfect action movie. Surprisingly believable for much of the movie, without resorting to the standard superhero melodrama too much. This I didn't expect. Another aspect was the appropriate use of CG. It wasn't overt. One scene in particular, the camera panning around Batman perched on a building, the cinematography is very 'real' looking. At least one major flaw that I just couldn't ignore being that this is a 'realistic' superhero movie. Without spoiling anything, let's just say that humans contain a lot of water. The whole 'save the day' scenario was unfortunately plain, nothing we haven't seen before. I think that's where the movie failed for me personally. It even felt a bit rushed there."
128,"I can't understand why this film got such a good rating. I'm not really a comic book fan, but this film just left me cold. It had a great cast and a promising young director, yet i left the cinema wondering why I bothered. Christian Bale only seemed to come to life briefly in the part of the film where Bruce Wayne adopts the American Psycho character ( which Bale did so well). I think this scene was at a party?!. Gary Oldman, another great actor, seemed to be cast in the wrong kind of role. Katie Holmes?! - enough said. Maybe I was expecting too much from this movie, as i expected this movie to be a million times better than the previous 2 batman films. It turned out, in my opinion, to be a photo finish for the winner. Can someone please tell me why this movie was good?"
129,"A nice effort, I suppose, but a failure nonetheless. I actually prefer the first three installments of the 1980s & 1990s Batman franchise, though none of them are great movies, either. Tim Burton  and even Joel Schumacher  brought at least some vision into their Batman worlds. Nolan attempts to do this realistically  that was the original idea, anyway  but he is bogged down by screen writing and action movie clichés. There weren't half as many explosions in all four of the 90s Batman films combined. Batman Begins does little to deepen the story, as some critics have claimed. The backstory was told perfectly, and with great economy, in 1989's Batman. There was no emotion lost. Nolan takes nearly an hour to tell it, and he doesn't make it any more interesting. They didn't find a better actor to play Batman. Christian Bale is as dull as Keaton, Kilmer, and Clooney. The villains are uninteresting. Ra's Al Ghul (which is mispronounced throughout the film) has always been my least favorite of the Batman villains. Dr. Jonathan Crane, aka ""the Scarecrow"" is wonderfully played by Cillian Murphy when he's out of his mask, but he is supremely uninteresting when he's in it (doesn't help that Nolan resorts to stupid distorted images and noise pollution whenever he puts the mask on). Katie Holmes is a wonderful actress in small projects, but, like Natalie Portman, she doesn't translate well to blockbusters. Plus, Tom Cruise just ruined her for me. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson are horribly miscast (Wilkinson as a mob boss?). They actually might have just switched roles and it would have been better. The only things the film gets excessively right are Alfred and Lucius Fox, played by Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. But, really, while these two consummate actors bring an air of class to this kiddy pool, they out-act both the hero and the villains to such an extent that it warps the movie. I really should not desire more scenes with the butler. I should add Liam Neeson to that, as well. He's very good, and perfectly cast. Batman Begins is often a good actioner, but it should have been much better."
130,"I actually didn't like the movie that much, I'm actually a fan of Batman returns, because i've always enjoyed Tim Burton's storytelling, and of Batman Forever, which it's just pure undiluted fun. This movie doesn't have any bad acting, nor it's poorly directed, the movie it's really fast-paced and it's reflected in the score which doesn't change for much part of the movie, i think the main problem of the movie is in the writing, the scenes between characters are too short, so you don't have much time to relate to the characters, one moment they're talking to each other, then we move to another scene, then another, then an action scene, then an explanation scene, and although it looks good in paper, the lines just don't work, and they basically connect the movie, since some of them are heard on the beginning of the movie and then heard again at the end, not to mention that the lines are very pretentious and try to make even the most normal situation into a complete psychological and philosophical event (for example almost every scene that involves Rachel and Bruce, and some of Alfred's lines when he's not desperately trying to be funny, he should have leave that to Lucius Fox or the Gotham newspaper which has the funniest scene almost at the end of the movie). I didn't enjoy the bad guys that much, they weren't so threatening, with one amazing exception, played by Tom Wilkinson (Carmine Falcone), who it's just amazing, and even though he's in the movie for about half hour, it's completely memorable. I think the movie was ruined for me because i had really big expectations, and i actually had seen some scenes from the movie before i went to see it, for example the one where Bruce goes to the hotel, almost all the scenes with Lucius Fox showing Bruce Wayne all the hi-tech gadgets, and i thought the movie was gonna expand that, but the scenes were the same, and it's really not that crazy to say that the whole movie can be summed up by the trailer. On the good side of it, i think the batmobile steals the show, but as i said, scenes are very short and quick, so it steals the show for the 15 minutes it appears in it. if you wanna watch the movie don't expect it to be something really, really memorable, the movie it's not confusing, it's pretty clear in it's plot and plot twists, the problem is that it's a Two hour and fifteen minutes long movie that happens to fast, and doesn't stop to entertain us fully, or to connect us to it's characters."
131,"Film is an unfortunate result of concepts lifted from ""The Shadow"" and ""Star Wars"". Fight scenes drag on. Liam Neeson reprises what is sadly becoming his signature role- i.e that of the damaged teacher to a young student.(Reference ""Star Wars"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"".) Despite strong supporting cast this ""Batman"" does not take wing. Special effects are interesting. Particularly notable are the designs for Batman's body armor, the batmobile, and the ""memory fabric"" forming the bat gliding wings. The soundtrack lacks the stirring personal themes of past Batman films. Story contains strong concepts regarding what can be defined as ""true justice"" as opposed to mere ""revenge"". As always, box-office profits will determine the possibility of a sequel."
132,"I find that some movies use music, 'witty' or attempted dramatic dialogue, British people, and ninjas to make you think that its a good movie before you can form your own opinion. I'm not saying that these elements (among many others of course) can't be used correctly, just that they are often used to trick the audience in the same way as special effects or 'lots of colors and noises' are (in a brainwashing kind of way). One of the main tricks I found in this movie was the gimmicky premise to try and put batman in the so-called real world. Here we have Gotham with normal skyscrapers, supposedly normal, real people, and an attempt at explaining everything that Batman goes through. But to me, this is where the movie shot itself in the foot--the ideas of Batman don't belong in this world, and it's obvious in the attempted explanations throughout the plot. For example, Alfred says that the only way to avert suspicion about buying bat-ears for the costume is to order them in bulk. Of course, this is nonsensical, because they are still ordering tons of rubber ear shaped things which could be tracked veeeery easily (its not every day a private party orders ten thousand rubber ears). In the beginning, I found the mystical ninja society of justice to be completely misplaced next to the otherwise realistic prison camp that appeared in the opening. I mean, they both 'looked' realistic (they had real tables, real people, etc...), but one of them had criminals being punished for crime, and the other was a league of unknown ninjas whose predecessors had sacked Rome 1500 years earlier (or whenever that happened). I would have liked it better if the movie had stuck with Tim Burtons style by making the prison and cities look less realistic, because then the transition from normal to absurd would not have been so obvious. When its all absurd, its believable, but when it tries to be both absurd and believable, its just silly. Additional things that bothered me a little each, and all together made the movie less fun (most of this has to do with the 'realistic twist' of the movie failing in my opinion):-Why didn't anyone from Wayne enterprises recognize that batman was using a car designed by their company and thus realize that it was Bruce Wayne who was Batman.-If Batman was real, his shenanigans would kill many civilians via use of the stupid tank (can you tell I didn't like the new car), which goes completely against the theme of justice.-If people could call a hundred thousand bats with a sonar device the size of a cell phone (and from inside a building), then that would be pretty amazing--where can I find one? Oh... I can't. Just because some bats use sonar as a guide doesn't them all come to me when I make a certain noise (even if i made a sexy mating call).-*warning: cheap shot* Why was the Gotham DA ten years old?-MICROWAVES THAT COULD BOIL WATER AT AN ENORMOUS RADIUS WOULD BOIL THE WATER IN ALL HUMANS THAT WERE ANYWHERE NEAR IT, KILLING THEM ALL (yes, even Raz-al-gul and Batman who managed to fight next to it near the end).-Why would someone build an armored rocket powered jumping car just to cross a river with a rope. (wouldn't it be easier to fire the rope across without the car?)-Batman made all of his bat-stars with a grinding wheel? Wow!-I didn't know that memory alloy was the secret to human flight (I always thought it was only good for making wrinkle free clothes or bending spoons). Why haven't inventors jumped all over this one yet. Again, why did they try to explain all of this?! It just sounds stupid to people who know a little about it.-It's a good thing that Morgan freeman had enough time to spray-paint the tank black. Because it wouldn't have been kewl otherwise.-All the goons were stupid in this movie! Argh! And not in a comical way like in other Batman series/cartoons/movies.Anyway, I thought that the movies was okay when I left the theater, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it was just one big gimmick with a bad plot. My rating for it has subsequently dropped. Besides my complaints though, it was somewhat entertaining. I wouldn't see it again though.^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ *~* *~* *~* *~* *~*5/10"
133,"This movie was fairly iconic with the recreation of Batman after a couple of shameful sequels to the original series, but I often found it hard to keep up with and it bored me most of the time SO MUCH that I actually had to take breaks from it. The runtime doesn't help with that.I believe the villain was one of the least favourite from the Batman adaptions and a more suitable, classic villain would've been a better choice.However, I did watch this after I watched Dark Knight. Dark Knight was a lot more explosive and attention-drawing than this. But this is a good movie on its own, portraying the tough, greedy life of Bruce and how he tries to evade his life and then try to step back into it. Michael Caine is excellent as Alfred, as he tries all the way through to guide Bruce in the right direction.5/10"
134,"This movie didn't feel a lot like Batman to me. Better than The Dark Knight, a lot better actually. But still not quite Batman. This movie had some good qualities (due to a great director behind the project) such as character study. The performances were nothing to brag about. Bale was actually acceptable in this (unlike TDK), the villains were so-so, the performances were basically average. Nothing groundbreaking, but luckily no cringe-worthy performances either. In the original comics, Batman was supposed to be a great detective, with great villains capable of outsmarting him. in Batman Begins, none of the villains have any real motives, other than committing random acts of terror. If you have dumb villains, the protagonist will most likely adjust to their intelligence, which was the case in Batman Begins. The film was simply devoid of an interesting protagonist, and even more devoid of interesting villains. The action scenes were badly edited, they certainly took away from the enjoyment and made the film look even more like an action film, and even less like Batman. What Batman Begins also lacked was great cinematography and visuals, which was the primary reason this didn't feel like a comic book film at all. Watch Burton's Batman films and you'll see what I mean.Overall, an okay film, but a disappointing Batman film. I guess this is one of those films where I can understand why people loved it, but I am unable to love it or even like it myself. It just didn't appeal to my taste.Moose finds this film worthy of an 8."
135,"When I went to go see Batman Begins I really did'nt have anything in mind that it looked cool, after I saw it, it did'nt really do anything for me meaning movie wise, plot wise and the story now don't get me wrong I thought it was alright there were some parts that I liked but just most of the movie did'nt grab me. My girlfriend on the other hand thought it was great, I think she used the word ""impressed"", it impressed her I don't know maybe I am just one of those love-the-original-movies guy. I still have to say that Batman with Michael Keaton was great. Can somebody explain to me who really killed Bruce Wayne's parents? I mean was it Joker or Joe Chill? Cause I am lost on that subject but otherwise the fighting scene's were pretty cool and I thought that Christian Bale was alright. Please somebody respond on the question I asked earlier"
136,"""Batman Begins"",praised and paraded by the critics BUT if nothing else this movie proves as a fine example of just how wrong they can be. Although the movie was original and interesting in places it generally gave the feeling of never really beginning,as if something was just about to happen......but it never did.(ha ha,rather ironic as I look to the title now). Christian Bale was well cast as the moody beginner in the batman suit but the general atmosphere of the movie was a disappointment and ruined a potentially interesting character.Michael Caine was the only light relief from the depressingly moody and overly dramatic sequences with other characters. That girl from Dawsons Creek (insert name here) was positively cringe worthy trying to play a character who is strong and deep,when really all the audience can concentrate on is her misshapen teeth,scarily thin waist and stomach churning squeaky voice. The movie poorly endeavours to give a more realistic feel to the franchise yet still indulges in many fantastical moments,and I feel the two aspects don't gel well. Unlike Burtons triumphs with his Gothic style but believable back stories,this movie tells us too much but provides little in the way of action,humour or visual fun. Furthermore the ""Villain"" who proved as a camp,menacing monster in Burtons movies,with fine examples such as the Joker and Catwoman,""Batman Begins"" excuses consists of a camp busy-body who occasionally dons a filthy mask,wails for a while,and calls himself the scarecrow from time to time,who is then defeated quicker than a foot to a cockroach,he is poorly seconded by an ageing warrior type figure who is about as menacing,frightening or indeed interesting as a fat ginger cat. The only promising aspects of the movie,were the simple style costume which was a welcome return from the suit with nipples which made us all cringe in batman and robin,the heart warming and believable relationship with Bruce and Alfred,and indeed Bale himself.But to all those of you who were left laughed out and awestruck by Burtons dark camptastic masterpieces this movie will certainly disappointed,and now I shall finish on that very note,shamelessly screaming and howling at the top of my voice BRING BACK BURTON!!!"
137,"This movie could have been so much better. The Scarecrow is such a cool villain, but they pretty much killed him by making Ras Al Ghul the real main villain. With all the bad guys from the Batman franchise; why choose the worst one? I mean, he's just a regular guy!! Anyway, some of this movie was good. The fight scenes were horrible. I saw it at a drive-in and I couldn't tell who was punching who. I still don't know if Batman threw a single punch in the entire movie, thanks the the quick, up close shots, and herky jerky camera movements.If you're a Batman fan, stick with the Tim Burton version. Don't believe the reviews. This movie was nothing special."
138,"I thought this movie had an awesome trailer, so I was really excited to see it. However, the movie takes way too long to get started, has some confusing character motivation, a tacked- on love plot, a patronizing politico-economic agenda, and a climax that feels like a video game. Christian Bale is great as a tortured, wealthy man leading a violent secret life...makes sense. Katie Holmes and Liam Neeson are essentially wasted in this movie, as they exist solely to make Wayne do things--their own motives are confusing or silly. Why is the psychiatrist who becomes the Scarecrow so evil? He is by far the most entirely evil (rather than just bad or greedy) character, but this is never explained. I didn't think any of the bad guys were very memorable, certainly not in comparison to the Joker or Catwoman (in the comics). So...good effort. Nice try at atmosphere, and good acting by Bale and Caine. The bat-mobile was dumb, and will look silly in a couple of years. As will most of this movie."
139,"Warner Brothers in it's inestimable judgment, has now recreated the ""Batman"" character 5 times ? In this latest installment, we now travel into Batman's psyche, again, but this time , we go to the other-side of the world, to learn of his training, and motivation?, to understand the criminal mind !! How exciting, for fans who have never seen the other 4 installments !!! Beautifully photographed in the mountains of Iceland, which is the backdrop for some Oriental sanctuary, Bruce Wayne(Chritian Bale), begins his training by Master Ducard(Liam Neeson), to purge his fear,and become invincible against all evil, had enough ? Qui-Gon, uh ER, Liam Neeson is one tough dude, TOO tough, and Bruce decides to bolt, but not before destroying the sanctuary ,and saving Master Ducard from certain death!! Bruce returns to Gotham as a changed man, and decides to dedicate himself against the forces of evil , by creating an image, the image of a BAT !!! Being the son of a millionaire has it's perks, and he finds resources even he didn't know about, in the bowels of the Wayne Science Labs, enter Lucius Fox(Morgan Freeman), a trusted and invaluable employee,but definitely overlooked !!!Anyway, Batman becomes a living and breathing entity, he beats one of the bad bosses Carmine Falcone, a mob overlord, kicks the drug lord in the Butt, and then must confront the REAL top dog bad guy, plot twist...WOW !!!In between, he puts up a front as a PLAYBOY, to convince the public he is superficial, saves Rachel Dawes D.A.,(Katie Holmes) from more bad guys , and in the end ,a climatic fight with the SUPER DUPER bad Guy on the El Train !!! Not a bad film, but just forget about the first 3 or 4 Batman films and start all over ,AGAIN !!!O yeah, there is also a car chase scene, with lots and lots of destruction and more destruction !!!I guess the Batman franchise is becoming generational, like Disney films, in another 7 years, we can do it all over again !!!If you like a darker Batman, then this one is for you !! Michael Caine gives a Jaws 4 performance, I guess even he is bored with acting and special effects !!! Maybe he is looking forward to Jaws 5, or a remake of Hannah and Her Sisters ? Whatever....The directing is good, but whatever, see it in IMAX, at least the characters are more interesting 40 feet tall....."
140,"When we were boys we used to put the bath towel down the back of our shirt and make it a cape. We became Batman. Batman was a badass comic-book superhero who kept the streets of Gotham City safe. When you're a kid all you need is a towel and your imagination to have fun.Now that we're adults, we evidently have to rationalize and justify the fantasy. Laughter is not allowed, and cardboard and towels are no longer acceptable. To recreate the once-innocent fantasy of being a crime-fighter we now need leather, latex, and steel. We've graduated from toys to sexual torture devices. And there's no more buzzing about the room with a smile on our face- frowns are required. And sadly there can be no joy in catching the bad guy because now we're just as morally compromised as he is, and the loose-legend that once framed our hero is now dour gospel, a precise back-story so painfully-constructed and realistically re-enacted that we cannot possibly deny it's all real, and all really happening.Except it's not. This is a movie. A super-hero movie. And you can call me corny but I want to have fun when I go to a super-hero movie. It can be campy-fun, like the old Batman TV series, it can be dark-fun, like Jack Nicholson's Joker. It can even be corny, inspirational fun, like Richard Donner's Superman. But to watch a ""Batman"" this serious just drains the life out of me. Are we being punished for our youthful exuberance and fond memories of playing after school? This film works so hard to prove Batman is real that they forget we don't want him to be real. He's a fantasy... he exists in our imaginations. You filmmakers do remember imagination, don't you?I'll get the towel.GRADE: C"
141,"I did not like this film as there is no comical relationship as we saw in the television shows.Tom Wilkinson gives a wonderful performance as a mobster. His Brooklyn accent is memorable.The beginning of the film was rather boring as we get into the story. Nonetheless, the tragic death of our hero's parents was vividly told.As the film progresses, there are some nicely done action sequences but the story is rather uneven. Bring back the old television show. Christian Bale does an adequate job as our crime crusader. While he did have this terrible tragedy in his life, the human element in his performance is missing."
142,"I really wanted to like this film.I didn't.Here's why: The first thirty-forty minutes of the film: totally useless. We've already seen Batman's origins in the first film, albeit a coincidental double-murder at the beginning of the film, and we've seen all this martial-arts rigmarole in Kill Bill and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. You can take away the entire first segment of the film, and nothing is lost.The film doesn't really start until Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham. At this point, I was thrilled that the movie had moved along. The thrill was short-lived.I found the mobster angle to be interesting: Bruce Wayne/Batman was in a corruptible network that had become incorruptible by virtue (or vice) of its own corruption. Fine.Batman catches the Kingpin of one gang, and all of the sudden, everything is better.Hokum.If that had actually happened, there would be a mob war that Batman would find almost impossible to handle by himself.Then, there is the obligatory being-chased-by-the-cops angle. (Oooh, is he good or bad? I just don't know!!!) In the third act, Bruce Wayne/Batman is chased down by the ghosts (?) of the ""Legion Of Shadows"" and they are threatening to destroy Gotham via the poisoning of the water system.First of all, martial arts have nothing to do with the Batman myth, unless we are just talking about one of the graphic novels. Even so, it doesn't advance the plot at all: In fact, it delays the plot by about thirty-forty minutes.Secondly, one Mafia kingpin going down does not mean that all crime in Gotham ends. Yes, I know his underling (please, this sleaze is the second-in-command?) is still running free, but there would be plenty of other mob families waiting to take control.Finally, these non-entities from the beginning of the film show up again, and terrorize the city with poison in the water? Why was this film made? To make money, obviously. I certainly coughed up my five-and-a-half bucks.I guess my main problem with the film is the intent of the film, which the director has made clear is to make a ""serious"" Batman film.You know what? When Tim Burton made his first Batman film, he was accused of the same thing.The mistake that Christopher Nolan has made is that he has made a Batman film that is serious, but he forgot to make it fun.He certainly wants to eat his cake and have it too, by trying to throw in ""funny"" one-liners, but by the time we get to them, their time has woefully passed.At least three times during this film, I couldn't wait for it to be over. I haven't felt that way about any Batman film so far, even the inept Batman Returns."
143,"Following on from such rival efforts as Bryan Singer's X-Men (2000), Ang Lee's Hulk (2003), and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002), studio Warner Bros puts its hat into the ring with a different breed of superhero, in its attempt to make amends for the woeful Catwoman (2004), and importantly to pave the way for a lucrative summer 2006 season with Singer's Superman Returns. A deeply embroiled tale about the formative years of its protagonist, the film is worlds apart in tone to Raimi's glamorous precedent-setter of 2002, but achieves just as much success with a varied cast, and above average script.Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins expends the bulk of its narrative originality and bite in its long opening first act, a tightly-wound veritable bundle of familial and romantic intimacy, tragic personal loss, and the much more palatable triumph of the almost-superhuman over mere humans. In the space of its first half hour, a revolutionary supply of dark and psychologically rich material is made available, but the result sometimes leans towards the saccharine. Overly eager, for instance, to explore the pre-adolescent's nightmare of suffering terrible, instantaneous change (thrust upon the child Bruce Wayne here via the trauma of his parent's murder, but more to the point the subsequent wasted efforts to satisfactorily reprimand the killer), Nolan peppers the early section of his film with the trademark Oedipal/patriarchal concerns of the standard action-adventure blockbuster, but without retaining some of the distinctive identity of his previous Insomnia (2002) or Memento (1999). Familial relations are thus developed in crudely superficial terms, so that the result is often a collection of fairly anonymous, sitcom-style vignettes.Once Begins projects itself forward into the present, and charts Christian Bale's (the now mature Bruce Wayne) attempts to better comprehend the criminal mind, the film slips in to the kind of slick, masterly form its marketing campaign has been hotly promising audiences throughout the summer. In fact, the male ascendancy and initiation ritual, largely dramatised here for the most part in China where Bale perfects the art of unarmed self-defence, is clearly well on a par with that of Russell Crowe's General Maximus in Gladiator (2000), or even that which occupied Keanu Reeves's Neo in the original The Matrix from 1999, so that one is caught on several occasions deeply engrossed in the protagonist's struggle to assert and perfect the self as he works perilously towards the final coming-of-age ritual execution of an unarmed prisoner, an act which we know ultimately he can never perform. But like Mary Harron in 2000's American Psycho, director Nolan's reluctance to stray from the commercially safe material and structuring of the blockbuster only fails to mark as untrue the suspicion that both filmmakers maintain a troubling lack of confidence in Bale's abilities. Like the bitterly hilarious and simultaneously upsetting final monologue in Psycho (when he confesses his sins to his lawyer's answer machine), Bale only has the one rare scene to properly convey the adult Bruce Wayne's overwhelming sense of desperate alienation. The bulk of his suffering is given over instead to child-actor Gus Lewis in a number of flashbacks which begin when Bale recounts past events in the extended prologue.Indeed, while hardly encumbered with unique opportunities to variously convey psychological depth, Bale's scenes are at least more palpable than the myriad ensemble pieces charitably donated to its support cast. Having appeared in The Phantom Menace (1999) and this year's Kingdom of Heaven as something of a masterly swordsman, Liam Neeson is a credibly rough and surly-mannered tutor/paterfamilias until the Gotham-based bloodletting begins, while the previously well-acclaimed Ken Watanabe (as another sword-wielding artist in Ed Zwick's The Last Samurai, 2003) is here apportioned strictly Hitchcockian MacGuffin duties as League of Shadows master, Ra's Al Ghul. The attempts to project a credible and liberated woman in Raimi's overwhelming commercial successes Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 (2004), appears not to have rubbed off on screenwriter David Goyer (Blade), who assembles elements of Julia Roberts's DA in Conspiracy Theory (1997) and even Kim Basinger's reporter from the original Batman (1989) to conjure for Katie Holmes the bland, sexless Rachel Dawes. It's precisely the sort of role which is remarkably disproportionate in size to the heavy levels of media attention lavished upon the actress in these tabloid-obsessed, pre-War of the Worlds times.It is the conventionally progressive storyline and the officially-sanctioned acceptance of Batman into the police system through the sympathetic figure of Gordon (all too rapid, and all too easy) which rather worryingly for comic-book fans may be perceived to repeat identical narrative arcs belonging to Tim Burton's original film. Given this, the filmmaker's (and arguably less so, the studio) efforts to distance their 'new' production from the Burton and Schumacher sequels feel for the most part largely wasted. Still, there's just about enough here to applaud than there is to deplore (the film merited some applause at the screening I attended), which makes it even more of a shame that studio Warner Bros could care less from this point on in which direction the franchise heads. Stripped of the attention-holding training sequences in China and the refreshing tormented malice of its central protagonist, Begins is essentially the same old grand commercial concept, and seems ultimately to be no more sinister, or more revolutionary, than its main big-feature predecessors. And yet, given the clear and dynamic conflicts set up throughout between such seemingly clear-cut concepts as normal and abnormal, good and evil, victim and aggressor, Nolan has suitably paved the way to explore these tormenting struggles in future works."
144,"'Batman Begins' should have been one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen only I didn't have that many expectations to begin with. However, it managed to leave me mad. As I write this review, I've just come out from watching 'Sin City,' and in this Roberto Rodriguez movie you have everything that Christopher Nolan's movie tried to get right but failed miserably! What especially bothers me about 'Batman Begins' is its pretentiousness! It's because it perverts a movie's nature trying to make it be something it cannot be; it's pretentious because, for all the acclaim Nolan got with 'Memento,' he's not an artistic director with indie sensibilities; and it's pretentious because it's no more than a summer action blockbuster pretending to be an artistic movie! But neither Nolan has the intellect to pull off a truly artistic ambition nor can anyone make an artistic movie out of $150m budget. It cannot happen because no Hollywood studio that puts up so much money will ever allow it. So Nolan can fool how many people he wants with this ordinary action movie, this is not the great masterpiece being hyped on the internet and through word of mouth.It's no better than the 'Spiderman' and 'X-men' franchises: they in fact invented the formula and gave a better use; we're finally living in an era where superhero movies are being taken seriously and given the 'realistic' treatment. 'Batman Begins' tries to be painfully realistic and horribly fails  first of all, because at the end of the day it will still be about a man that dresses up like a bat; and because, unlike 'X-Men' and 'Spiderman,' its realistic moments are boring and messy. The ridiculous beginning with Bruce Wayne in a prison somewhere in Asia is just ridiculous. Starting the movie with dialog like 'I'm your demon,' 'no, you're practice' immediately destroyed my hopes. It then moves to a strange, gratuitous brawl.But let's start with the fine points  I must admit there are some. First of all, I enjoyed several of the flashback scenes predating Bruce's self-exile from Gotham City. The scenes with young Bruce playing in the garden with Rachel; his failed attempt to kill Joe Chill; his conversation with Carmine Falcone at the restaurant  those were all very good. And Christian Bale was very good in all his Bruce Wayne scenes. In fact, acting is something I can't complain about in this movie: Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, tom Wilkinson and Liam Neeson were all very good. Of course Gary Oldman was better than anyone else, but he's Gary Oldman: really, his performance as Jim Gordon was just superb. However, as good as actors they may be, they're still only playing mediocre, one-dimensional characters. Bale even got the chance to play two one-dimensional characters in a single movie! Now Katie Holmes and Cillian Murphy  whom everyone is over-praising  were just plain dull! And this is where all the problems with the movie begin. Starting with Liam Neeson's character, the villain Ra's Al Ghul is just one cliché after another. Every line he utters is full of pseudo-philosophical pearls of wisdom. It's like he never stopped being a Jedi  'you must face your fears,' 'you've traveled all over the world but now you must travel inwards,' 'will is everything.' Honestly, with corny dialog like this, what claim does anyone have to complain about 'Revenge Of The Sith.' I didn't feel as embarrassed watching Lucas' movie as I did watching Nolan's.I won't even discuss the ridiculous plot. Now I'd discuss the action, only I couldn't make out anything of it, being so dark, fast-paced and full of close-ups. In an action movie not even the action they got right!? Gotham City is a city we've seen countless times in cinema over the past 23 years. It's basically 'Blade Runner' without the rain and Asians. I saw Gotham City a few years ago in 'The Matrix,' and before that in 'The Crow,' also in 'Dark City' and more recently 'Minority Report.' However I haven't seen a distinctive aesthetic like the one Tim Burton envisioned for his Gotham City lately. That was a unique vision, Nolan's is just derivative trash. Even the Batmobile is an ugly piece of metal. In its attempt to conform to the hyper-aggressive trend in modern superhero movies, we get a ridiculous tank with three wheels capable of silly stunts.I can't expect this to be worse than 'Fantastic Four,' but then that's another movie I'm not getting my hopes high for. In the end, 'Batman Begins' is just a big disappointing pseudo-artistic action flick: it'll disappoint anyone who wants action; it'll disappoint anyone who believed the hype about the complex characters and great dialog  people like me  and it'll disappoint people who are bothered to deconstruct this piece of trash and see it for the sub par movie it really is."
145,"Nolan gets a lot of credit for snatching the Batman franchise back from the abyss of crappiness that Joel Schumacher plunged it into, but let's face it -- the action scenes in Batman Begins are horribly shot. They're dark, chaotic, and you can't tell what the hell is going on in any of them. Also, Christian Bale is awful in this film -- he's the emotional equivalent of soundproofing material. Whenever a real person with some emotionality appears -- Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman -- the screen lights up briefly, but then Bale drags it back down with his inertness. Also, I can't be the only person to point out that the plot makes absolutely no sense. Bruce Wayne balks at killing an anonymous murderer in his rite-of-passage, but 2 seconds later has no apparent qualms about killing 50 of his buddies instead. Liam Neeson's mission is saving the world from criminals, but he's got no qualms about killing everybody in an entire city because there's too much graffitti on the subways. Katie Holmes is terribly miscast the world's least convincing ADA. Overall, I'd have to say this is one mediocre movie, and only the spectacular crappiness of the last Batman gives this one any shine at all."
146,"Man, I love that Batman comic but to like this one I had to forget all about that stuff. I mean, the comic Batman is like a super-detective, inventor genius who is also strong and 2 fisted. In this movie he farms out all the smart guy stuff to other characters so he can concentrate on doing ninja fighting. He's an awesome ninja but he ain't no Batman...even with the corny rasslin voice. Not to overly compare it to the comic though, it's a fine fine ninja movie. Once I put the idea of ""Batman"" out of my head it was a great visceral fun movie about a guy who dresses in a weird s+m Kevlar suit and beats up criminals and ninjas for vengeance late at night."
147,"Of course this film has it's good points, especially when it is compared to the other Batman films. It is darker, less aimed at children, funny input by Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine and !!!OF COURSE!!! the best Batman ever (Christian Bale).What about all the bad points? The whole 'Karate-kid' beginning, the lack of a good villain, the lack of originality, the cheesy hint at 'Batman Continues' (or whatever it will be named), the superficial character that is Mr. Gordon (a man of Gary Oldman's talent is wasted here), the bad editing (I just could not figure many of the fight scenes out...I like them kick-ass...Michael Keaton Style), the bad love interest (really...what's her name is awful). I could continue...but I won't. Sure this is just the beginning but keeping the above in mind, the scale can go BOTH ways. The beginning is OK, the character is SET, now (please) BLOW US AWAY (and don't try and do it by blowing more stuff up and creating idiotic stunts and villains).6,75 out of 10 (with a tiny seven given upon voting, although the film is highly overrated, being # 111 in the top 250)"
148,"When Tim Burton first did Batman the movie (1989) you didn't expect a sudden change to some other actor after Batman Returns (1992). While Michael Keaton was glad to not get stuck in a type cast mode as the dark knight, it didn't help those who followed Tim Burton's Batman movie from the start, to end up shifting over to Val Kilmer, George Clooney and finally Christian Bale as Batman. I must say George Clooney as Batman would be best placed teamed up with Superman. Val Kilmer was too young looking and should of been the dark knight of this Batman Begins movie. When I first saw Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman I thought maybe they were trying to find someone who kinda looks like Adam West. Bale just doesn't look convincing as Batman much like some of the later actors of James Bond character didn't look the part. It's this change over too much of the main character that can jeopardize a movie's continued success, to where people will lose interest quickly. Which is what happen to me. Everyone has a different depiction of how Batman started out and this is one of them. Sadly enough, without the creator Bob Kane around, Batman can easily run amok and away from it's original concept or what was actually envisioned. It looks like the writer and director had their doubts about Batman Begins because the audience would not appreciate yet another switch over to a different actor as the dark knight, which was correct. It most likely why they added more prominent actors in it (Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer and Gary Oldman), so as to assure it would make it on top instead of doing a failing flop. Batman in this movie looks like demonic gargoyle with an evil smile and depicted much like the villain Bain character of Batman & Robin (1997) movie. Or even like the crude looking Batman: Arkham City PC game."
149,"Batman Begins is about the idea that justice triumphs over vengeance. It is the second best of Chris Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy (behind The Dark Knight and ahead of The Dark Knight Rises). And you can see why with the story chart.Batman Begins goes about demonstrating the idea that justice triumphs over vengeance with three plots. The main external plot is of course, Save Gotham. This is augmented with a love story between Bruce and Rachel and an internal struggle of Bruce to seek revenge or justice.The problem is the internal plot ends in the first act. He chooses justice when he leaves the League of Shadows and his internal compass never again wavers. The love plot ends ambiguously at the end, even though he has chosen the path of the straight and narrow and defeated the revenge-seeking League of Shadows. So for the majority of the movie all we get to watch is Batman saving Gotham, and that can get boring pretty quickly. For a more interesting take on this idea, you will have to see the next in the trilogy, the epic Dark Knight.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca."
150,"Compared to the movies I have seen these past two years, Batman Begins does an adequate job of putting batman on the screen. However, it is still a bad film.First, I have to establish that I am a fan of the comics, and I really dislike it when movies completely disregard the story and history established in the comic books.With that out of the way, Batman Begins casts Christian Bale, who is the best Batman actor I have seen, but it doesn't say much when you look at the past Batmans. The story is divided into two parts. One talking about the beginnings of Batman, and the second about him saving gotham.As always, 2 villains are cast. Raz-Al-Ghul, and Scarecrow. Scarecrow is played over the top, but that is a good thing as I believe that's how villains should be played in Batman.Raz is a different story. The Raz in the comic is much better, and this one does not do him justice. The actor is very good, but it is the way Raz is portrayed that really disappoints.Then, plot holes. Mr. Wayne wears a tux, but rides the subway. They come out of a high class opera house to the lowest slum. It just does not make sense.Katie Holmes is the most horrible thing about this film. She throws in corny one-liners as if her life depends on it.Bottom line, compared to the stuff I have seen this past 2 summers, Batman Begins is actually entertaining enough to be worth the $5.25, if you are willing to completely forget what you know of the caped crusader."
151,"There are some wonderful scenes but the movie left me cold since it didn't tell a ""real"" story. Rather than following the hard-won lore of storytelling as described in the Hero's Journey by Joseph Campbell, Chris Vogler and others, the plot meandered, starting a new thread, failing to end another, and then jumping back to a thread which had petered out. Finally, the viewer was left not really caring what happened, resigned to watching special effects for their own sake rather than as part of the story.Let's hope the next Batman movie (as well as the next Superman movie, et al) can attract some writing and directing talent."
152,"I don't really care for this movie. Needless to say it's not the worst Batman movie, but it's not the best either. Now remember this is just my opinion. First of all I don't think the acting in this film is good. Christian Bale is good as Bruce Wayne, but Goofy as Batman. Mainly because of that infamous growlish voice. Liam Neeson does good as Ra's Al Ghul. Needless to say I don't really like Ra's Al Ghul, but Liam Neeson does good as him. Scarecrows is the coolest of the two villains, but it's a shame that there's not much focus on him. Michael Kane is also great as Alfread. He's better than Michael Gough. Morgan Freeman also does a good job, but I need to ask one question. Is he in the comics? I just always wondered that. Now lets talk about what is easily the worst part of the movie and that is the action sequences. They are the worst of all time. The camera angles are annoying half of the time, I could not see what was going on. Also I really dislike the scene where Comisioner Gordon drives the Bat-Mobile. It always seemed Dumb. The story to this movie strikes me as not to interesting. When his parents a killed, millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne relocates to Asia when he is mentored by Henri Ducard and Ra's Al Ghul in how to fight evil. When learning about the plan to wipe out evil in Gotham City by Ducard, Bruce prevents this plan from getting any further and heads back to his home. Back in his original surroundings, Bruce adapts the image of a bat to strike fear into the criminals and the corrupt as the icon known as 'Batman'. But it doesn't stay quiet for long. Special thanks to FilmFanUk for the synopsis. In the end I don't know weather or not you should see it or not, but me I don't care for it."
153,"I can't believe you Batman fans! I can't believe anyone really liked this movie! It's a total BS film that destroyed the story of Batman. The movie wasn't even that enjoyable, it was brought more into a horror movie than a comic book or even a whimsical/corny TV show. Christain Bale as Batman? He's better than George Clooney, that's for sure, but he didn't give much depth to his character. It's like ""Look! My voice can get scary! I'm Batman! No, really, I am!"". Katie Holmes? I'm recently ticked off with her and Tom, so I'm going to back off and just pretend she wasn't in the movie at all. The villain? Who was it? There was no main one! Plot holes!!!! There were a million. OK, supposedly, this homeless person killed Bruce's parents, NOPE! WRONG! It was Joker, and even before Jack became the Joker, he was a smooth gangster. Not a homeless man if you will. Also, this is supposed to be a prequel to the first Batman? Then why are people using cell phones and updated cars? The first Batman was set in the 80's.Jeez, people! I'm not trying to be all harsh on this film, but this was in no way the best Batman! 4/10"
154,"The problem with many, many superhero films in this day and age is that with each and every single one, the fantasy element seems to decrease. there is a worrying amount of realism applied to these films. lotr, the star wars trilogy, the matrix, even sin city, were all excellent because the film makers crafted a thoroughly believable fantasy world that absorbed us. batman begins sucks because it is based entirely within the real world (gotham city could just as well be new york, LA, even London or Paris).when in reality, if a guy dresses up in a rubber suit, as a 'bat', and starts to fight crime, he'd be arrested for being a pervert/ vigilante or both, and would get sent down to the loony bin for life.many fans of comic books, or 'geeks', as i like to call them, have got to understand that comic books exist as pure fantasy and nothing else. I have noticed, esp. since harry Knowles aicn, that a lot of emphasis has come into making super hero films real and dramatic. Could you imagine if the lotr or star wars trilogy were treated as gritty dramas rather than the outstanding piece of genre film making that they are? Theyd be terrible.There is one scene in batman begins that seems especially ludicrous. commissioner Gordon (played by a wasted Gary oldman) is seen having a dead pan conversation with a guy dressed as a giant rubber bat, and doesn't seem to batter an eyelid. The scene is played out for real, and like the rest of the film we are expected to believe, without any clever twists, that this could really happen. When without all the explosions, action and SFX, the film would be nothing.If these 'geeks' want their fantasy films and nothing else, then so be it. If they want human drama, realism, plausibility mixed with the surreal, watch either classic 70s films such as taxi driver, clockwork orange, apocalypse now, day of the locust, David lynch films, or Japanese horrors such as uzumaki. a gritty drama about a giant rubber bat is kinda pushing things a bit too far."
155,"Down-and-out young man meets a master of mysterious powers in the East and learns from him.Young man returns home after a falling-out with his master & uses the powers for good.The master returns with a nefarious plan & the young man must defeat him.Wasn't that the plot of ""The Shadow""? Why is it being reused here? Too much far East. Too little Batman.Since ten lines are required, here are some additional comments:Batman reveals his identity to Rachel. This raises two questions:Who the heck is Rachel? Are we trying to imitate the ending ""Spiderman"", but in reverse?Why should Batman do this? What is the point of having a secret identity if you are going to tell it to every young lady who takes your fancy?The vision of Batman under the influence of the psychedelic gas also raises a question:Why does Batman look like a Ralph Bakshi character from his animated version of ""The Lord of the Rings""?"
156,"Plot Outline: Disillusioned after seeing his parents murdered, millionaire heir Bruce Wayne (Bale) travels distances to unravel himself and to find means to fight injustice while, his wealth, his company has fallen into bad hands. Bruce returns to Gotham, a new man with a dark side: Batman, a caped crusader who teams up with upcoming cop Gordon to fight crime.Comment: Christopher Nolan's Batman is credited with the focus on the central character and its development with unprecedented detail. Sadly, it has been painfully overstretched. Although one would argue that there is more of Batman than the weird-villains, I would rather say that villains bring out the best in superhero movies rather than a bland portrayal of the character's mental development for 140mins. Probably, there are shades of Nolan's inexperience with Action flicks and his comfort with movies like Insomnia.Christian Bale dons the cape as the fourth Batman after Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney and looks like he needed to spend more time in his cape to establish himself as Batman. Liam Neeson's Jujutsu and Ninja classes reminded me of Fishburne in Matrix. Stars like Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Cutie Katie Homes are underutilized. Technical work is neat on SFX but nothing great to look for.Rating: 2/5"
157,"I hate to say it, especially in light of the raves, but Batman Begins is a bore. This thing needed a few more rewrites (or at least one by a good writer) before it was set to film. The basic story is very well thought out, the origin of all Batman and all his iconic and psychological paraphernalia, but the dialog is horrible and the visuals lack style. Now I know that director Nolan was trying to set Batman in the ""real"" world, but does the real world have to look so dull? More importantly, do the people have to all talk like zombified, robotic idiots? Even the fatass morons down I see buying candy bars with food stamps at the Safeway utter more colorful dialog than is offered in this movie. There is a complete lack of any wit, spontaneity, or intelligence in the dialog. The conversational dialog is stiff and--oddly enough for a film striving for realism-- archly cartoonish. And there are more lame, unfunny scene-ending bon mots in this thing than a 1980s Roger Moore James Bond movie. Oh, it's just freakin painful! If they couldn't hire someone who could write decent dialog they should have at least hired a director who knew when to CUT out bad dialog; this would have been much better as a silent film. And on top of that, the thick rubber bat costume STILL looks stupid. It is really jarring to have all this drab, ""realistic"" set design with a guy in a fake-looking, goofy rubber suit running around in it. This thing makes thin Christian look like a black chipmunk with its ears clipped. I'm surprising even myself with this, given the high expectations I went into the film with, but I much prefer Tim Burton's Batman to this boring, predictable junk."
158,"4th Viewing and it gets worse each time. I liked it the first time I watched it. The second time too, but the third time it was kinda forgettable and now the 4th time I really see the problems and why I never really remembered what happened.The writing is the culprit of why this isn't very good.First, Katie Holmes is a total bore, she has a personality of a dead fly. Totally lifeless, which isn't good when she is supposed to be Wayne's love interest. Just showing two kids playing for 2 min isn't enough to develop a believable love story. Even as adults, Nolan didn't give us any reason why Wayne would be in love with Rachel. Just having characters exchange looks doesn't cut it. Especially with a dull character like Rachel.Then some of the dialogue was so beyond cheesy I laughed out loud. Alfred was supposed to be on Wayne's side but he constantly seemed to fight against over for the sake of just having drama/conflict. Caine is a great actor, so it's unfortunate his role was such one-dimensional.Freeman was much more interesting.There was no good reason why Wayne was afraid of bats. Them flying out of the well didn't seem like a legit reason why he feared bats so much and had to overcome them. This is like being afraid of dogs but never being bitten by one. To have such deep fear you need to SHOW why and the audience should feel just as afraid. I didn't, and I don't even like bats.Cillian Murphy was definitely one of the best things, but he was totally underused. He was also too easily defeated.In the end, Batman Begins had way too many villains and most of them had too quick of a climax before they were doomed like Carmine Falcone, Joe Chill, and Scarecrow.Nolan just had too many ideas cramped into one film.There is also some inconsistency with how Batman isn't supposed to kill for whatever moral grounds he has, but then he carried a gun and went to kill Joe Chill. That makes no sense.Why does he leave Gotham as an adult for 7 years? Did I miss something?One of the offenses Nolan committed was the total lack of relationship between Wayne and his parents, again, like with the relationship with Rachel, it was tidbit moments without much substance. I literally didn't care when his parents got shot, because I knew NOTHING about them and their relationship with Bruce.If you are going to make a Batman BEGINS, then we need more substance of why he became Batman. Juxtapose this with Star Wars a new hope where we see Luke's day-to-day routines, his interaction with his family, their dinners, work, relationships etc. They could easily have spent 15-20 min on Bruce as a kid and why he loved his parents and why they loved him with ordinary family stuff. Not him pointing and his father giving him a two-sentence life lesson. It's lazy typical writing where they show a kid hugging his parents and then expect people to think that creates a bonding relationship for the audience. They rush to action but forget that action only matters if we care about the people in the action and we can't care about them if we don't know anything substantial about them.I probably won't ever watch this again."
159,"I just learned that Memento, this film and The Prestige were all directed by Chris Nolan. I know, ""what, have I been living under a rock or something?"" Right, but, I really liked Memento, a lot. Now, I can see a lot of similarities directorially between the three films once I thought about it. It also occurs to me that one of the things a dislike so much about Batman Begins and The Prestige is that they have so much going for them and they fail to deliver. They both have great actors, good plots for the most part, very good atmosphere and pretty good story telling on some levels. Unfortunately, they all three rely to much on some type of gimmick. Memento was done before the clever twist was so overused which helped it a great deal. It was also done in a particularly clever fashion with the story telling mimicking an aspect of the protagonist's situation. Batman Begins, while it does not rely on one major plot twist, does rely on a series of gimmicks for its main story. Even though this is typical of comic book inspired stories, Nolan does not handle these elements very well and I found it very hard to suspend my disbelief. The same thing happened to me with The Prestige. I think Nolan likes stories that have mostly dark characters that do not have any of the typical redeeming qualities we are used to seeing in main characters in stories. He seems to like characters that allow their obsessions to overtake all the other aspects of their lives. I have to applaud him for being willing to take on these types of characters. However, I think he spends so much time on their dark side that is very difficult for audience members, or, at least for me, to invest any real interest in the outcome of their story. It worked in Memento because the character had a physical flaw that made it difficult for him to deal with his character flaws. In Batman Begins, as well as The Prestige it falls flat.Perhaps it is a sad commentary on the time we live in that these films get the high ratings they do. Maybe very few people are able to believe that there is actually good in most people even some that do bad things. We went from having clear cut heroes, to having the anti-hero, to just having different shades of villains all mixing it up with one or the other arbitrarily winning. I know, the Batman fans out there are saying ""but this is one chapter in a much larger story"". Even though I am a comic book fan I look to the film makers of this genre to make the films episodic for maximum entertainment value. This was very nicely done with the Spiderman series, by the way. On the other hand, Batman Begins doesn't make me sympathetic enough to the protagonist to really care one way or another how things turn out. Save the price of the DVD and go buy some of the comics, I am sure it will be a better experience."
160,"This movie was a horrible portrait of Batman. Christian Bale's performance was quite horrible. He seemed way too dark, even as Bruce. As for the plot, it was pure frailty. The plot was so stupid I could barely keep my attention on the big screen. The villains seemed to obtuse and nothing seemed to click. Also, the whole part of the story that told about how he became Batman was just bitter. Apparently Batman is a super ninja. As for how he gained his bat-gadgets, well, it's just moronic. One would think that Batman MADE his tools, but, they are all military tools that were never good enough to produce. Also, the Bat-Mobile was TANK!!!! That's stupid!!! I really didn't enjoy this movie. The effects were good, though."
161,"First of all, I'm not against this movie. I found it entertaining, it wasn't boring (and that's rare nowadays), but... I can't understand why critics celebrate this so much. It's not gonna be cinema history as Tim Burton's first film, it's not as dark as the first film, and even the plot is not as good as the first films. There are lots of events in this movie copying Batman 1989's scenes. The escape of Rachel, Batman and Rachel in the Batmobile, then in the Batcave, the dialog is almost the same as the first Batman's. Remember Batman and Vicki Vale in those scenes. The music is not so characteristic, like Danny Elfman's was, and the image of Gotham City is not what a fan imagines. Even the actors: Bale is OK, Caine is good, Liam Neeson is the same as the jedi master, but KAtie Holmes is less than a Batman-girl... first of all, blond looks better in dark Gotham, and after beauties like Kim, Michelle or Nicole she looks more like a mouse. I don't like rewriting the story (The Joker is gonna show up again) and summarizing: it's not what we except from a Batman movie. There are no great stars with charisma like Nicholson, Basinger, de Vito, Pfeiffer or good characters like Christopher Walken was, there's no comic feeling, not dark enough, no cool Gotham or Arkham sets, no Cool Bat-music, no blonde beauties, no good villains... Next time, make the movie more BATMANISH!!!"
162,"The fact that it's a Batman movie and that it's jam packed with stars just wasn't enough to float my boat. The acting? Peachy. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are great actors. And sure, I feel that Christian Bale was a great choice for the next Batman (naturally, anyone will do to wipe out the memory of Clooney). But where was the thrill? The entertainment? In Burton's Batman, Michael Keaton's Batman shows himself right off the bat (no pun, I swear), taking out thugs and strutting his weaponry--examples of his weaponry and his prowess multiply as the movie moves along. In ""Begins"", a scenes are wasted with Batman either hiding in the shadows snatching up villains, or the fight scenes are slapped together, the frames flickering by too quickly to see any real hand-to-hand. There was no intensity to this movie, no drive; okay, the bat-tank tears up the street--but that was the longest action sequence! Whoopty-doo! I read a review that said that his movie was 1000 times better than Spiderman 2. Pppppleeeeasseee. This movie just seemed thrown together. I was so bored. Really."
163,"I had high hopes when I saw ""Batman Begins"". I shouldn't have. From the rushed opening hour, to the unspectacular entrance of Batman and the mediocre, uninspired score, ""Batman Begins"" is a big budget waste of time. It makes 2004's ""The Punisher"" look like ""Ben Hur"".Christian Bale was okay as Bruce Wayne, but he's no Michael Keaton. The rest of the supporting cast were good. I wish I could say the direction was. The action scenes are shot in the dark with a jittery camera, perhaps to conceal the lackluster Batman suit and the movie also includes one of the funniest moments ever captured on film. In a homage to ""The Simpsons"", the Batmobile is being chased by the police, Batman simply turns off the lights and the cops race past...Batman drives a ghost car! In a zillion dollar picture like this surely David Goyer could have thought of something better than that.There are other problems too. For starters, Wayne Enterprises built the tumbler, the car that is used as the Batmobile. When Batman has this big chase, the whole thing is captured by a news crew and played on TV. Problem: Didn't anyone from Wayne Enterprises see the Batmobile and go ""Hey! That looks like our tumbler, only black!"" Other troubles are the mentioned action scenes. There's no set piece. No grand entrance, no bit where your pulse races. The makers just seemed content they had a Batman picture and that was enough.Then there's the ending. Not since ""Red Dragon"" have I groaned so loud.David Goyer is a writer who with each successive film is proving ""Blade"" was a fluke. His screenplay for this movie is pedestrian at best and Christopher Nolan's direction shows he should stick to intimate thrillers.This Bat's had its wings clipped -- big-time!"
164,i did not like the first hour of batman begins. it was stupid and made no sense. in all the batman books i have read Bruce Wayne was never in a camp in china. batman begins when as a kid his parents were gunned down. and whats with all the flashbacks the movie finally settles down to what a batman movie should be like. the bat car was better then those long stupid ones we have seen in the last movies. the actors were great.in 1939 the year batman came out.a lot of you were not born yet so my take on this film is completely different then yours.i rated this film a 4.i did like all of the batman movies good or bad.they were still entertaining
165,"Now I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a big comic book reader, and perhaps this has clouded my judgement on this film but having seen it, after all the hype, this film is, in my opinion, rubbish. What angered me the most wasn't the story as such, but the directing. The beginning was painful slow to the point of boredom, the fight scenes were a blurry mess and was there any need to treat the audience like goldfish by replaying the scene with the stethoscope and his father again at the end of the movie when Bruce picks up the burnt remains. We can remember, you only showed us an hour ago!!! Not what I expected. I should have waited for the DVD release from Blockbuster."
166,"This is an over rated film that has taken itself as a serious drama. First of all, remember kids... it's Batman. A comic book. All the melodramatic music that played throughout the film made me chuckle. The opening tries too hard and shoves too much down your throat too quickly. You are expected to care about people you just met on screen 3 minutes ago. The hour long back story could have been summed up in ten minutes. Plus, Liam Neason seemed to have too much of the Jedi knight bug in him... I like Christian Bale as an actor. I do... Now, he looked the part, smelled the part but wasn't the part at all. He was lifeless and boring kinda like the film itself. There wasn't enough Bruce Wayne in the film. The billion dollar playboy. The moments he did have just seemed like a spoiled rich kid that could have used some anti-depressants. I didn't feel confusion or insanity in his role. Yes, his parents were in it a lot more and hopefully that would have made you feel his pain when they were killed. Unfortunately, their characters were crappy as well so my heart couldn't pour out for anyone. Nice try though. Katie Holmes character was bad as well as Katie Holmes herself and her so called chemistry with Batman. Who was the villain again? The Scarecrow could have been a more thought out character. He seemed pretty non-existent. Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are both fine actors but were they needed... No. Now, I'm not too familiar with the comic which is fine cause the film should work on it's own but did Batman drive a Hummer? The action sequences were boring (too fast and too close) and seemed as though I've seen them thousands of times before. I wasn't very impressed with Gotham City either. It just seemed too normal and not very threatening. The only thing that kept it from looking like any other city I've been in was the double layered trains. Hmm... I did like Michael Cane, the hallucination drug and Nolan's attempt to do something different with the series."
167,"Warners attempt at re-imagining the Batman franchise will certainly prove to be a money maker, but many will feel disappointed by this one.The comic book elements that the original movies established so well has been abandoned here, so the dark, unsettled and distinctly ""fantasy"" world of Gotham City is reduced to a more reality-based vision. Everything from the skyline, cars, suit, weapons and characters all feel a little too viable in todays society, then to fit into this now legendary fictional city.While a great idea to show how our hero ""begins"" and an obviously fresh perspective into this character, many will feel frustrated when an hour into the movie, the Batman has still not been revealed in all his suited glory.Those not familiar with the first four movies will surely be impressed with this beginning and there is much to celebrate here. It is essentially a well told story and the direction is clearly solid. The cast is also impressive, however, the acting heavy-weights such as Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine & Gary Oldman, clearly outclass the acting of Bale and that is something that really undermines this one. When you leave a movie having a deeper memory of the supporting characters then the lead, something has definitely gone wrong somewhere."
168,"Weren't the parents killed by Joker? We see that in the first movie with Micheal Keaton. Now the murderer is someone on the street. It is a huge mistake. Did I miss something? How come no one mentions that? Joker says:"" You are a lucky kid,"" then walks away shouting ""Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?"" Then Batman recalls that scene in the movie, etc. What was this movie about? Does not this movie follow the previous movies? Is it an all new Batman based on the comic book sequence? I would be glad if someone could make it clear for me? And if it does follow the comic book sequence, then it is a very wrong adaptation of the scarecrow. Think about it."
169,"Let's make it short, the story is OK, but the casting... Bruce's parents are very rich people. They are going to see an posh opera, but when they leave, the outside is very dodgy, it's like a no man's land. This doesn't make any sense, this area could have been better. Why changing Bruce's voice when he's holding his bat mask. Keanu Reeves could have play it better ( see the dumbest movie of the year: Matrix II and III). Apart from that, I found it very boring but with some nice effects: especially when Bruce appears, speaks his 3 words and then disappears. How can a good director like Mr Nolan ask talented actors playing like this."
170,"... and the three main reasons such an average film is so revered are probably: 1. It's a Batman movie (cult following..) 2. Christopher Nolan directed it (and everything he does MUST be great, right?) 3. It takes itself extremely seriously, and it's sort of trendy these days with superhero movies. I guess comics cult/passion has been so laughed at (as immature and childish) during three decades, that the aficionados needed some sort of virtual hero (in the form of a mainstream and somewhat competent work done by a ""serious"" director) to make them feel better...The worst parts are probably the corny revelations about Batman's ""past"" (so he's a NINJA? *LOL* Must be the most laughable plot device ever..), and the totally uncinematic, sloppy, dull action scenes. I'm not a fan of comic books movies (though I like the first 2 X-men movies) but if I enter such a world, I want at least the action sequences to be highly cinematic, spatially engaging, in short I want movie magic, something to transport me. Found those in ""Begins"" about the most dull ones I ever attended in the genre (I had more excitement in seeing kids fly on a stick in Bedknobs and Broomsticks!). Very Tee-vee, and not even on par with stuff like Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the series). Looks like low-budget, sloppy and incompetent action. Why are some mainstream movies even trying to pull off elaborated, difficult action sequences after all (Van Helsing, King Kong, X2, Pirates of the Carribeans..) if such tasteless action stuff as found in ""Begins"" is satisfying enough for the masses? This is gonna be gooooood news for the movie executives! *LOL*Every other aspect of movie-making here is competent, but straightforward, unimaginative and formulaic. Been there, seen that. Vaguely adequate pacing, the usual elliptical storytelling, formulaic staging and sets, monotonous editing... very, very average. I DID find something very good: Cillian Murphy's performance.I have a good laugh when thinking about the fact that so many people out there consider this (judging from the ratings and its position in the top 250..) as being in the same league as cult classics like ""2001"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""12 angry men"", ""Rashomon"", ""Vertigo"" and the like... kinda surrealistic for such a mundane, shallow and unremarkable flick. An insult to the face of the great movie masters of the past."
171,"In future releases, we may finally know why Daffy Duck is mean, learn of the dysfunctional family of Charlie Brown or discover the psychological traumas suffered by Olive Oyl during her youth, thanks to some filmmakers' urge to turn icons of popular culture (as comic book heroes/heroines) into cinematic ""human beings"" (resembling old movies more than real life), and eventually into myths of an apocryphal North American saga. Many Batman's fans were pleased with this incursion into the rules of the 19th century novel, declared it a masterpiece and the final word on the darker aspects of Bob Kane's creation. To me what Christopher Nolan, David S. Goyer and Christian Bale successfully achieved is taking Kane's universe out of the world of dreams and turning it into a melodramatic and fascist action movie of the latter days of American imperialism, without the previous films' campiness, high aesthetics or humour. Now we have a masochist psycho as the winged hero, a Batmobile of the globalization era, a gun supplier a la James Bond's ""Q"", and a sect of terrorists who babble Buddhist ideas but reject compassion. Although the terrorists want to destroy New York (here called Gotham City...) because they have made corrupt empires fall since the good old days of Constantinople, they look like today's Masons deciding the future of the world's economy in a secret room of their loggia. All this flirting with today's world affairs, more than pleased audiences, moreover because as an action movie it's above the standard. As a Batman product, though, in my case I prefer Tim Burton's superior diptych."
172,"I am sourly disappointed with this movie. Don't get me wrong.. the performances, the story, the casting, everything is great. The movie is also a very well done movie. It's just not a very well done Batman movie.Why do they call the Batman the Dark Knight? Not (just) because he wears a dark suit, but because his personality and persona are dark. He is tormented by the death of his parents, his thirst for revenge against every representation of evil, and the knowledge that no matter how hard he pushes himself, his revenge will never be complete. (Later, he is also plagued by the deaths of his sidekicks.) The Batman is not a hero, but more of an anti-hero. He is evil in the eyes of the evil, lacking any hint of compassion for his enemies. He has no qualms about breaking bones, cracking skulls, and doing everything to the bad guys just short of killing them. His methods are debatable and justly so, causing a rift in public opinion about whether he is good or bad.NONE of this is portrayed in the movie, despite all the pre-release hype of how they would show the real Batman this time. Instead what we get is just another cool hero who's got great ninja skills, a great costume and a great car. Another good guy (who seems to reveal his real identity a little too easily to both his love interest and Morgan Freeman's character, though not explicitly with the latter). The Batman is not a good guy.. at least not in the conventional sense. He is cursed and bitter, and he lets it be known.Audiences walk out the hallway unanimously feeling good about Batman. In my opinion, the film should have been such as to generate mixed feelings. THAT would have been a great Batman movie.Despite my opinion on the matter, Batman Begins still gets 4/10 (below average) from me for its good characterizations (except Batman's), a decent story, and some nice one-liners. The car by the way was designed and built specifically for the movie (several cars in fact), and the leap through the Batcave's waterfall is a real stunt in a real car."
173,"I found Batman Begins to be very under-whelming.All superheroes should be more than a mere mortal. They should have some flaws, but ultimately they should be better than you and me, they should embody something we can believe in. The movie goes to great to pains to explain even the most comic-bookish facets of Bruce Wayne and Batman. In so doing, it completely demystifies the superhero: he's just a man, and a bit of a 2-dimensional one, at that. If the characterization is off, so too was the pace of the movie. One expects a Batman movie to have a lot of action and a fast pace. Batman Begins delivers neither (satisfactorily).And, finally, for me, the casting seemed all wrong. Not once during the movie did I find myself relating to Christian Bale as Bruce of Batman. And Katie Holmes seems to bring nothing to her character. She's just Dawson's Creek's Joey all over again.On the lighter side: BChristian's husky threatening Batman voice isný husky or threatening or Batman, but is funny."
174,"This movie is a bad movie. When I watched this, I had no expectations. I didn't really know what to expect. I was never much of a Batman fan, so I just watched this movie to have some fun.The first half hour of the movie is excellent. The rest is just bad. Christopher Nolan does not know how to make good action sequences. He just pretends there's an earthquake and shakes the camera a lot. So we don't really see anything.But the big problem is the plot, the story. Like I said, the first half hour is excellent. Liam Neeson is great, and Christian Bale seems to be a more real, emotional Batman. But then... poof. After the first half hour, the emotion disappears. It just turns to another usual ""bad guys have some evil plan to destroy the city"" plot. And the emotional, more human Batman also disappears. And instead, we get the usual Batman... just another super-hero. But this time, he's in crappy action sequences. Chrsitian Bale doesn't need to act. Because it's just bad action sequences after bad action sequences, and he just needs to say his lines without emotion. It's the action that matters. Because it's just another blockbuster. And then there's the terrible twist, that completely ruins Liam Neeson's character.Fortunately, Katie Holmes saves the movie.(Note: I'm being ironic. Katie Holmes is TERRIBLE, and she needs some acting lessons).So, overall, what is Batman Begins? Well, it's a blockbuster. With bad action sequences. And a story with no heart. The first half hour is excellent, but that doesn't make up for two hours of bad cinema.It's just a bad movie."
175,"I feel like I'm always one of those people who rolls their eyes when someone says ""Christopher Nolan is such a great filmmaker"". Sometimes I feel like I'm being a bit mean. Nolan is an acclaimed director because of his vision for big blockbusters that are shot and film and rely on the spectacle of real sets and performances. Nolan exceeds well at what he tries to do, and its a sort of achievement that no director has accomplished. Personally, I don't love his style - it relies more on impressive setpieces then the language of film. But it mostly works. Yet I find this movies to be exactly what Christopher Nolan should not be directing - a fantasy. Because of his vision, and the conflicting interests with this story, I find Batman Begins to be an overlong, drab and rather than unengaging affair.Firstly lets start off with the story. I simply don't like this story at all. The stories of each of the movies in the Dark Knight trilogy are very loosely based on Year One, Long Halloween and The Dark Knight Returns respectively. I haven't read Year One, but Long Haloween and Dark Knight Returns I know are fantastic - and very different to their movie counterparts. So I won't blame the scripts fault on the source material. The problem with this movie to me is how quickly the events of this movie occur. In essence, Bruce Wayne changes from a boy, to a ninja, to the batman in relatively short time. So this exciting arc of Bruce Wayne becoming the Batman is lost immediately. In fact a significant problem with this movie is that it really isn't about Batman becoming Batman. It's more like ""this is what Batman would do to become a hero"". There needs to be a story about him becoming the figure of batman, maybe learning not to murder or become a better vigilante. Yet halfway through this movie he knows what hes doing. The central conflict, that being Batman to become a hero, is kinda mute and as such there isn't much of a thread to hold us onto the story other than ""Batman needs to stop bad guy"".And that's another thing - too many antagonists. I feel like no one brings this up, but there are essentially three antagonists in this movie - Carmine Falcone, Scarecrow, and Ra's Al Ghul. And they aren't really teaming up together - each antagonist gets set up, only to be foiled onto the next villain. If there was a constant driving villain as there was in the Dark Knight, this wouldnt be a problem. However Ra's Al Ghul, who is essentially the Big Bad, isn't established as a villain until the very last half hour. By that point the movie has failed to really connext with me with an opposition. So to me there becomes no real arc for batman and no real threat for the entire movie. As such, I don't really have much to connect with this character.There's also the style of Nolan. One of the criticisms I have with Nolan is that scenes kinda blend together, so that there is rarely ""that scene"" in a Nolan movie - its more an event that occurs in a movie. In some movies it works, but in this movie because I'm not particularly invested in the characters I don't care. It's a sort of thing you need to do in a fantasy. In real life things don't just suddenly start - in the Dark Knight for example you might have a quick little scene with Joker and Gambol because it brings a level of realism. You're not seeing the Joker comically do something for four minutes as a normal scene. Yet in a fantasy world you need that. You need, for example a four minute scene where the Scarecrow's character is introduced. You need a scene where the city is established (as a fantasy city). When you go into realism it makes sense not to sort of overemphasise or exaggerate the world. Yet Batman Begins is a more fantastical story - it surrounds a group of seemingly magical ninjas, a really poorly designed and unrealistic city and a plot in which fear gas is going to be put into the water. To me this is at conflict with Nolan's vision. It would be like making a realistic version of star wars - you can make this movie dark, but it becomes difficult for me to assume this world as ultra realistic. I can't accept these characters but only as the works of fiction, and thus the movies can't try to trick me.It's also of note that this movie is just very poorly helmed when compared to Nolan's future work. As an action director I don't think Nolan is actually that great. In this movie the action is a lot of shaky cam and quick cuts to give the illusion (very poor illusion) that action is occurring. Along with that there is no real sort of danger for Batman. He perfectly rides his Batmobile and fights with precision. But this is a learner, I guy who hasn't properly mastered being a hero. An action movie needs the hero to be endangered, especially when there is otherwise no direct threat. Thre is none here, and as such I find this to be boring."
176,"I caught this offering on a freeview channel. And at first I began to wonder if the listings had got screwed-up. Where was Batman? For a seemingly indefinite time, somebody - I suppose it was Bruce Wayne - was faffing about in what I think were the Himalayas. They were mountains anyway. There was a bald-headed monk with a self-satisfied gaze like a hang-over from Quai Chang Kane's adventures, and Wayne getting the crap kicked out of him frequently. Here, I gather, was supposed to be the 'why he became Batman' expose, but the whole boring and verbose pantomime went on for so long that this little grasshopper dozed-off before he could grasp the pebble.I've awarded 3 ex-gratia stars for whatever I missed because so many people rave about this movie. But judged by the 20 minutes or so of what I did watch I'd offer no stars at all as it couldn't even sustain my attention enough to keep conscious.I would suggest aspiring viewers fast-forward to about halfway through. Presumably it livens-up a bit."
177,"Let's get this out of the way first. Joker didn't kill Batman's parents and Ra's al Ghul never trained Batman, nor is he a white Irishman.I couldn't care less how accurate a movie is to the comics, if it can stand on its own merits. Being accurate doesn't automatically make it good and vice versa. Batman fanboys are a finicky bunch, they conveniently forget about ""muh source material"" if they get validated that they're not watching ""kiddy stuff"". If they consider a movie ""mature"", any shortcomings will be ignored. For all the talk how ""grounded"", ""realistic"" and ""mature"" this movie is, it has a lot of silly and pretentious dialogue.Some questionable performances. Bale's Batman is more funny than threatening. The less said about Katie Holmes and Tom Wilkinson's Bugsy Malone take on Falcone the better. First hour, with Bruce is training, is solid. After he returns to Gotham, the movie takes a nosedive into a cartoonish farce. And then there are the fight scenes. Incomprehensible, Transformers-esque ""What am I even looking at?"" mess.Plot is straight out of some Z-grade movie, complete with secret society trying to destroy a city with a stupid doomsday machine. Water vaporizer? Really? That's the best Nolan and Goyer can come up with?Highly overrated."
178,"It seems like I am the only one doesn't like Batman Begins. I'm not a fan, and my knowledge of Batman comes from the ones I watched back when I was 8, but it is still no excuse that the movie was done so poorly.First of all, the plot and reasoning is nonexistent. For some reason, Bruce Wayne is in a Chinese prison. Somewhere along the line, *ninjas* become a part of the plot. The supposed Ra's Al Ghul is the leader of Liam and the ninjas, but what comes out of Liam's mouth is neither Chinese or Japanese. And Liam, being Caucasian, utters the only Japanese you'll hear in this movie, teaches Bruce ""ninja skills"" and proceeds to make a fool of himself by saying the lame Japanese names for every move before he executes them. Am I the only one who sees the problem with this?The action scenes are dizzy and done in too many close ups in too many shots. The ""batmobile"" is an ugly, enormous, tanker, and all the stuff Bruce gets for his Batman gear comes not from Alfred but from his dad's company, which for some reason is involved with making trains AND making all this high tech military stuff that even the military doesn't want. Bruce's voice, when he's Batman, is just Bruce Wayne with a sore throat.The biggest disappointment was the dialogue. The mentoring bit was too full of hocus pocus that is just repetition of ""FEAR this"" and ""FEAR that"" and ""OVERCOME fear"" that is supposed to be spiritual but results in what you can expect from a session with your psychologist but a thousand times cheesier. The dialogue was so poorly written that in every scene you have at least 3 actors reciting one-liners intended to ""lighten up"" the (pretentious) mood and garner knee-jerk chuckles from the audience, as you can see from the extremely long list of ""memorable quotes"". It was like the script writer said to himself ""Hey I know, why not stick lots of funny one-liners one after the other so I can show the audience how witty I am"". Also, his knowledge of ""dialogue"" doesn't extend further than questions and answers. For example:Bruce: Who are you working for? Man: blah blah blah Bruce: Where? Man: blah Bruce: Why? Man: blah Bruce: When? ...ad nauseumI could go on about more distractions and sheer idiocy (like when the city is sprayed with hallucinogens, Rachel and the random kid are not affected) but that would be beside the point, because the whole movie IS ONE BIG distraction. From other, better, movies that probably cost a quarter of Batman Begin's production cost."
179,"While I enjoy Tim Burton ""Batman"" immensely, I cannot stand this one. What are the problems with ""Batman Begins""? Well, I can name at least three ones. But what three!Reality. How come they put Gotham City into the real world together with Rome and other true-to-life cities? It is simply laughable. In the Burton movie Gotham is such an amazing ethereal place that it just frees your mind. And here we have a dirty town next to New York or whatever.Background. In certain amounts the background is great. But when everything gets explained, stretched out, chewed and re-chewed with a detailed psychological analysis of the characters... it gets boring and nauseating. In ""Batman"" (1989) we had two psychos. They just clashed and the whole Gotham was a battlefield for the two maniacs who did not have to back themselves up with the loads of facts from their lives - they were too stylish for that paraphernalia and too insane. And what do we have here? Numerous flashbacks which are annoying. The main character's idiotic samurai-like training as if he were going to become a Jedi knight from ""Star Wars"" trilogy (and there is also that actor who performed in ""Star Wars: Episode 1""). Scrutinized explanation of the technology performed by Mr Morgan Freeman and of the way it can be purchased. Deep speeches delivered by the evil and good guys that resemble the notorious rubbish talks from ""Matrix: Reloaded"".Actors with profound performance. What the hell is wrong with the performance? It's too self-imposing. I feel as if these actors are going to burst from inside  their self-importance is simply overwhelming. I feel the need to shout at the TV-set: ""Come on guys! It's ""Batman"", not ""Born on the Forth of July""!"" Those serious talks and big serious faces resemble scenes from ""Godfather"". Fine, they are making a deep criminal saga out of a comics booklet. Just brilliant.That's enough to lower the mark to a 3-out-of-10 level. The conception has been ruined. It's no match for the ""Batman"" from the 1989. By the way, I tried to watch this movie twice. For me to watch it from top to toe was unbearable.My verdict: unwatchable for the most part of its running time, but at least not completely tasteless and repellent (its major achievement). 3 out of 10. I would never bother commenting this one but it's on the top list while ""Batman"" (1989) is not. I cannot take this for granted. Thanks for attention."
180,"Of course, when in comparison to many of the films released this year, Batman Begins stand higher than others, and I might say that as a stand alone film it is quite entertaining. However, it would be blasphemous to consider this even a door step in comparison with Tim Burton's masterpiece, which starred Michael Keaton in his signature role. The original, a realization of a comic legend, only received 7.4 on the IMDb scale. It confuses me how the general public thinks these days. Are they comparing Batman Begins with the other films released during the year, or are they being serious about it exceeding the original? Here is what I think about Batman Begins............It doesn't even feel like a Batman movie. It misses the point completely. And I hate the excuses of 'making a new Batman film for the new generation'. THE NEW GENERATION ALSO NEED GOOD FILMS. I agree with the casting of Christian Bale, a great actor and once a child prodigy (most memorable in Spielberg's Empire Of The Sun), however he alone could not save this film from disaster. Christopher Nolan is a respectful director, but did he really think he could create his own Batman? Or was it a cash-in opportunity? The Batmobile - every time I looked at it, it made my face grimace. I understand the director wanted a modern prototype of Batman, but this.......what a contraption. The Batman suit did it worst for me though. The new re-done Batman symbol is pathetic. It looked more like the Nazi Eagle than the original symbol that really looked like a Bat. Why does Nolan require Batman to be modernized anyway? It is the Gothic, 1950's film noir style of the original film that made Batman a household name. The whole atmosphere so vividly created by Tim Burton in the original was breathtaking and bought a comic book to life. Christopher Nolan wanted a more serious approach to Batman, for it to be more realistic. The fact Batman is wearing a Bat suit is ridiculous enough anyway, and so the fact that the director sees the legend of Batman as serious totally misses the point of THE BATMAN LEGEND. It is just a comic book, and so the unbelievable can still be believable. It doesn't have to be explained, because it is simply fiction. Like the larger than life Gotham City Tim Burton vividly bought to life and much like in the comic book itself, it is just a story that takes us to another world - and utilizes our imagination. We don't have to make Batman real. It's like explaining how Superman flies.Although the film ran for well over two hours, and felt way overlong, the characters were poorly developed. I felt, walking out of the theater, like I didn't get to know the characters. It didn't feel like they were communicating in any way to the audience. Alfred, played well by Michael Caine just didn't click with me.nothing to do with the veteran actor. He just didn't have enough screen time or dialog for me to feel anything between him and Bruce Wayne. Also, the death of Wayne's parents in Batman Begins compared to the same death in the original, is like comparing the song ""Rain drops are fall on my head"" to ""adagio for strings"". Nolan was attempting to make a dramatic, touching scene and failed miserably. It seemed almost ridiculous  like an episode of Bold and the Beautiful. They should have made this scene the focal point of the film, so we could feel Bruce Wayne's pain and understand his Legend. I thought 'Scarecrow' was an effective villain, and he scared the hell out of me first time he revealed himself. But he too could not have saved this film from inevitable down fall.Worst of all, fighting scenes were atrocious. Unlike the Tim Burton classic, I couldn't see what the bloody hell was going on on screen. Close-ups, over-layered by shaky cameras, over-layered by quick-cuts so as we don't see how well the actors really fight - what a joke. Sure the story is great, but we came to see Batman kick the enemies butts. Some nice CGI effects were added to the film well, but they could not assist Batman in anyway, because they literally weren't really needed. I think people have either forgotten Tim Burton's unmatched atmosphere of Batman or what makes a good film. From Beginning to End I didn't feel like I was watching a Batman movie - it felt more like a normal action blockbuster we see too much of. It missed the whole Gothic exterior that made the original film larger than life and at times scary. The actors, including Michael Caine, Rutger Hauer, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman all did great jobs, apart from a few. It was the sets designs, the suit, the Batmobile, the normal look of everything that made this just a boring entry that shouldn't even be called 'Batman'. It is definitely better than Val Kilmer and George Clooney's mediocre sequels. However for this film to get a higher score than the original is like spitting in Tim Burton's face and forgetting the greatness of how film used to be made. Let's not forget one of the most memorable movie scores of all time from the original that assisted to define THE BATMAN. I can only predict that Batman Begins, only in a few years, will be laughable."
181,"Oh my! I am a great fan of action movies. Everyone had told me so many good things about 'Batman begins' that I grabbed the (zone 1) DVD as soon as I could get my hands on it and counted the hours which had still to go before the night. I finally sit in front of my screen, ready to immerse myself into a good movie and...find myself yawning after ten minutes. And things go so bad that it's even difficult to just list the problems. Let me try and give you some ideas:1. Extremely poor plot. 2. Extremely poor script. 3. Bad directing/lighting/editing for ALL action sequences (and some other sequences too). 4. A musical score which is, well, not really a score. 5. Bad acting by everyone but the five actors with a 'name'.The overall feeling is that you are watching a completely exploitative movie, conceived from the beginning (no pun intended) as a particularly stupid crowd pleaser. The idea seems to have been: put into the movie all the material which has now become standard after a few decades of action movies, do not do anything even remotely original, be as simplistic and formulaic as you can, spend a lot of money in hiring well-known actors, and you'll do fine. The worst part of it all is: apparently, the filmmakers are right, most people did enjoy the movie! Makes me feel desperate. Honest, this movie is BAD, BAD, BAD without even being funny. It's boring, verging on the insulting.I will not insult Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher by comparing any of their movies to 'Batman begins'."
182,"I can't believe we waited 8 years for a Batman movie, and this is all they can come up with. This film is a complete mess, from the confused non-linear storytelling (whenever its convenient), to the amateur picture and sound editing, to the sloppy, distracting directing. I hate to say it, but I'd rather watch the Adam West version of Batman (which actually had some wit) or even the George Clooney/Joel Schumacher disaster, only because it provides SOME kind of entertainment (in a B Movie kind of way). This film is devoid of humour, wit, suspense, mystery or even drama. All scenes are clipped down to their climaxes, and we are never given a chance to catch our breath.Once again, we are given 3 (rather than 1) villains, which makes the film 1/3 as good as it could have been (no, not 3 times as good!), while it tries to cram 6 hours worth of story into one rushed 2 hours.It's cut together like a movie trailer, rather than a story, so you're never really 'inside' the plot. You don't feel the suspense, or even the moment-to-moment reality of what's happening. So many scenes come and go with no real contribution to the 'story' other than to 'update' you on what's happening with the characters at the moment (don't confuse that with a real story!).There are elements of the film--mostly superficial--that do work, but they barely register as a blip in this mess. Gary Oldman (our finest actor?) plays Sgt. Gordon to a 't', but his sub-plot doesn't allow for much of his 'man-on-the-inside' role that he provides in the comic. Ras-al-gul resembles the comic book version in name only, as he has somehow switched from an Arab to Liam Neeson as a samurai (!?!?). Looking back, the film should've focused on the Scarecrow (and maybe an earlier draft did; the original working title was Batman: Fear, and 'fear' seems to be the main theme of the piece). Cillian Murphy's unique features couldn't have been imagined by a comic artist. Like the re-created version in the animated series, Scarecrow actually looks scary, and uses a power that would've been more satisfying is he actually got to use it more. Katie Holmes is excellent, Morgan Freeman is fine, and Michael Caine is adequate (I'm not British, but his accent seems way off for Alfred). All in all, it seems that there MIGHT have been a good film in there somewhere, but it was simply ruined by last-minute editing and a soundtrack that seems like an afterthought ( usually the same boring song runs through several scenes in a row, reinforcing the 'movie trailer' feel). Then again, the weaknesses could lie with the most important creative choice of all: the writer. I don't know where David S. Goyer ever got the reputation as a good writer, but considering the only credits he has to his name are trash-film comic book adaptations, he must have another career as a playwright or a novelist. First he adapted Nick Fury for TV, which landed him the Blade trilogy. Blade, despite its unexplainable popularity, is typical dark fantasy/action movie garbage; all silver/blue colours, heavy metal soundtrack and 1 dimensional characters. I suppose the shareholders at Warner must've seen the numbers on Blade, because not only did they give him Batman, they also gave him the job of adapting the beloved Flash to the screen (God help us all).It just goes to show that Warner should've stuck with their original plan of letting Frank 'Sin City' Miller and Darren 'Pi' Aronofsky adapt 'Batman: Year One', but that would actually require them to base their decisions on talent rather than the (imagined) potential profits.Oh, well, another in a long line of comic book bombs, I suppose (after Elektra, Catwoman, Daredevil and Hulk, the future is already looking dark for superheroes). The sad thing is, the investors might look at the choice to let Christopher Nolan (Memento) to direct as a reason for its failure, and thus shy away from letting other 'indy' directors take on big budget superheroes. Sadly, this could mean the next Bat-film might star Will Smith and be directed by Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich. Where's Michael Keaton when you need him?3/10"
183,"The beginning was slow at parts but pretty good. The last 2/3 of the movie was very bad. There was no entertaining bad guy other than Scarecrow who didn't have enough on screen action. Batman and Batman Returns were good because of their colorful and enchanting atmospheres and entertaining villains, this movie lacked both except the Scarecrow who wasn't in enough scenes. The movie is very boring and it can cause you to miss a major or major plot points so you just have to assume what the story the rest of the way because it is too hard to catch on. Without understanding the plot you can clearly see Katie Holmes is wanted by the bad guys because she is a DA and that the movie is about stopping the guys with drugs and stopping the plot to destroy the water supply. Michael Caine is good though he doesn't have enough screen time to develop a bond with him. Christian Bale is non charismatic, as were I believe the past Batmans in the other movies, but it doesn't have to be about Batman, it can be more about the villains, with some Batman, as long as it is entertaining."
184,"Batman Begins is the latest film entry in the Warner Brothers Batman franchise that I've been looking forward to, even while my interest was marginally low as a Batman comic fan (I contemplated skipping the movie). I own Batman Black & White, Batman: A Death in the Family, et al and I enjoy reading the comics immensely for well-constructed stories. I thought Christopher Nolan's new vision of the rise of Bruce Wayne as a cleverly intelligent billionaire playboy and a valiant crime fighter would herald the beginning of a promising new Batman movie franchise after the abominable failure of Batman & Robin.After the screening, I had difficulty evaluating the quality of the film - flat-out mediocre, weakly fair or shockingly bad. I attribute my disappointing impression to the one fatal flaw that ruined the film for me, as far as the movie-going experience is concerned: editing.Batman Begins is the distant cousin to Armageddon. Editing is what totally ruined the movie experience for me when it kept visually pummeling the viewer who was trying to follow the story amidst bizarrely chaotic action, marginal character development and fairly impressive direction by Nolan.Don't get me wrong, Batman Begins is close to being a good quality movie on the surface level. It's good to be different that spurn the conventional norms to make a truly unique film. But the crime at the scene pointing to the fatal outcome is maddeningly pretentious MTV-lite editing style that killed my interest in what happens in the movie. Some of the action scenes are so chaotic it's confounding and difficult to follow coherently from scene to scene. I thought Edward Scissorhands was brought in to become O.D. on the combined in-take of cocaine, speed and caffeine in editing the film to shreds to render it barely watchable for those who rise above the general audience's attention span of a goldfish.Batman Begins starts differently pertaining to the development of the main protagonist Bruce Wayne. At this stage, I thought the movie is going in the right direction that stands to purge the bad memory of enduring Batman & Robin at a sold-out movie screening the opening night in June 1997. But as the film progress, the film editing takes precedence in how the visual style should look. It may represent the fast-paced action of the latest comic book series, but for me it gave me a migraine headache. And the film got too predictable. There are the plot points in which I correctly guessed to be divulged, although I liked the creatively constructed plot twists towards the ending. It's fair enough to develop the story to take in the wholly fresh new direction, but I didn't find it compelling because it's very clichéd.Christian Bale shines throughout the film in spite of the excessively self-indulgent editing. He's a damned good actor and he shows that he can carry the movie without bearing a burden on his shoulders. The supporting actors in the film are basically cardboard cutouts as fairly underdeveloped characters suffering the savage hands of the auteur hack editor Lee Smith with the approved oversight by Mr. Nolan. No emotional impact and attachment whatsoever. Katie Holmes is close to terrible as District Attorney Rachel Dawes in Batman Begins - courtesy of Dawson's Creek acting school. No chemistry whatsoever, either - so bland it makes William Shatner's interactive chemistry with Kirstie Alley in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan seem convincing. Furrowing your eyebrows and pretending to be too serious do not equal good acting. Katie Holmes's miscasting is one of the worst flaws that undermine the film besides rotten caffeine-induced editing. And the ending is so blatant in its opening a slot for a sequel that it felt tacky instead of subliminal.Batman Begins is a forgettable film typical of the summer blockbuster movie mentality. The only memorable sequence is Morgan Freeman & Christian Bale test-driving a pre-modified custom-built Thundertank...er, Batmobile and it was amusing to watch as it pokes fun of itself with a self-acknowledged wink of humor.Christopher Nolan did a fine job speculating on the legacy of Batman's beginning, but the editing basically destroyed the film so it registers a negative response from a jaded moviegoer like me. Christopher Nolan and his team of editors should watch Ingmar Bergman's Fanny & Alexander and The Seventh Seal for noble film art in slow-burn psychological character development intensity with slow-moving but precise editing and learn what can be artful while developing an otherwise overwhelmingly commercial film.Batman Begins is worth seeing in a dollar theater. Otherwise, it's a waste of hard-earned money for a brief, limp escapade of following Bruce Wayne's adventure and vendetta with lesser psychological and visceral impact than expected.** out of four"
185,"Christopher Nolan blows the opportunity to make a definitive Batman movie by delivering a tepid, poorly structured effort that wastes the impressive acting talent assembled to re-tell the origins of the Dark Knight. It all starts reasonably well with a decently thought out, if a little rushed, origin story, but the film quickly unravels upon Bruce Wayne's return to Gotham. What awaits him (and us) is a dull, contrived tale with weak villains handled by a director whose talents obviously do not stretch to handling this kind of material. The action scenes in particular have you crying out for someone who knows what they're doing, while the character development and story (Nolan's supposed strengths) lack cohesion. Watching the film you have to assume its massive budget was spent on paying the actors, because it's certainly not up there in terms of design, settings or effects. It all adds up to a terrible waste of talent. Unfortunately, returns speak volumes and I'm sure Warner Bros. are already rubbing their hands at the prospect of equally banal, box-office conquering sequels. I only hope Superman Returns delivers a more satisfying, better quality effort and that one day someone will make a movie that truly captures the essence of the Batman of Dark Knight Returns & The Long Halloween."
186,"I can only mildly recommend this movie out of the strength of the cast, The plot and dialog of this movie is horrible and not the enduring caped crusader i grew up loving in DC comics. The cast is a dream cast except for Bale (whos work i love and thought he did OK as batman)although I feel is too young and looks more like Robin than stoic batman). But enough of that lets get down to it and my main complaint..this has the same plot as 1989's Batman with Keaton..What am I saying ?!?!...let me explain..PLOT OF 1989 BATMAN: The Joker Kills Bruce Waynes parents and wants to destroy gotham city by POISIONING and robbing them ( a poison which drives everyone insane which he released in float balloon leaving them with joker smiles, DEAD, remember that movie?).PLOT OF BATMAN BEGINS: Ras Al Gul, leader of the League of Shadows a vigilante group of Ninjas wants to destroy a corrupt Gotham city with..you guessed it A MICROWAVE INDUCING RAY GUN THAT POISIONS GOTHAM CITY DRIVING THEM INSANE..THEN DEAD)..You got it bat heads, this is the same movie, different villains. This is why i am so disappointed in the bad taste of reviewers and fans. This is not the Batman of my youth, this Bruce Wayne is written like an obnoxious snob (Bruce Wayne would have never have done what he did when he bought the hotel, a funny scene but completely out of character and unbelievable for a rich person yet alone a Wayne), hes a doormat to his childhood sweetheart whom he acts like he tolerates and is not a love interest. Another scene has Wayne acting like an a** to save guests which probably politically would have cost him everything in real life and ignoring Alfreds remarks of be the person your father wanted you to be (again acting like a prissy snob, although slightly unintentionally), in every scene of Wayne we see him acting unbecoming whether its rude ""funny"" quips like these or remarks to Luscious Fox of ""gee, do you speak English"" when Fox talks about poison antidote ingredients (hardly the detective genius batman i grew up loving). This wayne is ruined by horrible dialogue that is unbecoming of a person, if I had kids I would disown them if they acted the way Wayne/batman did in this movie.If you wish to know how a hero should ask when writing a plot for a hero in a film or book then just ask yourself, If you were sitting giving advice to your child when they asked (the characters are fictional but as example:) ""dad/mom if i ever have to fight Ras Al Gul on a train should i leave him or kill him...OR SHOULD I ARREST HIM AND SEND HIM TO ARKHAM ASYLUM THE WAY A REAL BATMAN AND HERO WOULD DO.), what would you tell them to do? For those who like the dark batman i have this to say,a superhero is a hero not because of their powers, but because of the values that they instill and endure in spite of their powers.You want to make a movie about a vigilante running around in a cape fine..don't do this to batman, its beneath him.That is the essence of the batman comics.Superman is a hero because he protects people, has values about human life and protecting people being an adopted earthling saving people and criminals alike, arrests them and doesn't vaporize them with heat vision.Spiderman is a hero because he has kids bullying him, has great powers, but doesn't beat them to a bloody pulp for doing so or flip out and go on a rampage because he's teased. Batman is a hero in the comics because he suffered greatly at the loss of his parents to crime and still does the right thing, he arrests villains and is always a POLICEMAN, a lonely detective, he is not a vigilante. These hero's know the difference between right and wrong, the difference between the good fight, fighting what you hate and not becoming what you are fighting. This is not the fatherly, stoic, broad shouldered police detective i grew up loving as a child but a sad shame.This batman the cops fear yet in every Batman comic i grew up reading he was the police mascot..they even gave him a signal..he never acted like a vigilante (and yet i think the graphic novels completely got him wrong, have the joker committing acts of violence but Batman, other than a good beating..no)To me the writer completely missed what a hero is about and what batman comics were about, as did reviewers of this movie and franchise. A sad sign of the times when preachy inhuman values are being taught by filmmakers, even more so watching movies like this and wondering why i have to sit through movies like Terminator 3 and Episode III(both given rave reviews which I disagreed), this film and its undue praise are why.I don't mind a dark batman, I don't even mind a violent Batman film but remember a superhero is a hero because of how they act, not because of their superpowers. I can only mildly recommend this film out the strength of its cast, watch the original for a much better (and darker) Batman with Keaton and Nicholson."
187,"A great cast wasted. More Hollywood vacuous tripe. I paid Euro18 to take my 12 year old son to see this and we both came out the cinema shaking our heads in disbelief at the sheer awfulness of it. When will they realise that these comic adaptations just don't work on the big screen. The idea that even in the US, companies exist that spend huge money to develop super weapons that somehow never see the light of day until our leading man comes along to liberate them is so convenient and such a cop out. It insults the intelligence of the audience. Mumbo jumbo pseudo science, hackneyed stereotypes and woeful dialogue. My mother in law is scarier than Cillian Murphy even with the mask on.If you are considering going to see this then think a slightly better version of Daredevil. If that floats your boat then go for it. Otherwise stay well clear."
188,"Batman Begins begins with what is nearly the worst sound mix ever. It is alright that the music track is loud and it is OK that the characters whisper  but not at the same time. This movie justifies everything Norma Desmond ever thought about sound.Then we have the close-camera fight scenes. What's with that? Everything is a meaningless blur. This cinematography is actually worse than the Bourne Identity sequel. If the idea is to make us feel we are in the fight rather than watching the fight, it is clear the cinematographer has never actually been in a fight. It is sad that a lot of great effects and stunt work were reduced to smeary blurs. What a waste of footage and of the viewers' time.If the audience could watch the action and could understand the actors' dialog, this might be a cool flick  except for the inane car chase which requires cops who can read minds. As if. With prescient police Gotham wouldn't need a righteous rodent."
189,"I cannot remember the last time I was so disappointed with a movie. I went into BATMAN BEGINS with pretty much no expectations, and I was very disappointed. I actually felt sad on the way home afterwards because I was so disappointed. I really can't even think of much that I did like. Christian Bale was alright, but the only scene where he really shined as Batman was when he interrogates a crooked cop atop a fire escape. But otherwise, he was just so-so as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. I missed seeing Michael Gough as Alfred, but Michael Caine was the highlight of the film, without question. My favorite scene of the whole film is in a flashback where Alfred tells young Bruce that his parents' murder wasn't his fault. The rest of the cast was okay, except for Katie Holmes, badly miscast as a District Attorney. Gary Oldman fared pretty well as a pre-Commissioner James Gordon (he certainly looked the part), but he's given almost nothing to do and seems to only be in a handful of scenes. Rutger Hauer is the CEO of Wayne Enterprises in a subplot that isn't needed at all. I couldn't help but feel that a lot of the movie was just padding that could have easily been trimmed out.As for the villains, we get the Scarecrow, Ra's al Ghul, and Carmine Falcone, a local gangster. Now, I know the point of this movie was to make it Batman's film, but the villains were handled so badly I practically felt cheated. The Scarecrow, one of my favorite of Batman's Rogues Gallery, is seriously wasted. He's no longer the Ichabod Craine-looking college professor, but instead a sophisticated-looking pretty boy psychologist. In the comics, his poisons cause people to experience their greatest fears. Here, they simply make people act crazy more than anything else. Ra's al Ghul is also wasted. He appears to be killed early on, but turns up later in an unnecessary plot twist that reveals Ducard (Liam Neeson) is really Ra's, the one we saw killed having only been a decoy. Thus, Ra's is absent for a good bulk of the film, and as a result fails to make much impact as a villain. Even worse, the ""villain"" shifts constantly, from being Falcone to Scarecrow to Ra's, instead of just giving us one for Batman to deal with, the way it should be. This was the problem with the third and fourth Batman films, and I was very surprised to see them falling for it again in this film. (Anybody remember how well it worked out for the first BATMAN and SPIDER-MAN when when you've only got one villain?) It just really ticked me off how they handled the villains, because they were using two of the most interesting ones. We saw glimpses of Scarecrow's potential in a few moments, and when he finally gallops into the thick of the action at the end, on horseback and (finally) in full Scarecrow costume, we expect to really see things hit the fan. But what happens? He gets zapped with a stun gun by Katie Holmes and runs off screaming into the night like a little girl, never to be seen again. What!? And Falcone was a total waste. We already had two other much more interesting bad guys, so we could have done without him.Other things that irked me: I really hated the Batmobile, even more so after seeing it in action instead of just pictures. And the scene where it jumps across rooftops? Geez, wasn't the point of restarting the franchise to get away from the junk we got in the last two films? I couldn't believe it. The murder of Bruce Wayne's parents was also poorly-handled. It had much more emotional impact in Tim Burton's BATMAN, where I actually felt sadness seeing it happen as opposed to this one, where it's over and done with before you can really react to it. (Which I guess is something they might have intended, but it still had no affect on me.) And Gotham City! I know Christopher Nolan has said they wanted to make a ""realistic"" Batman film, sort of bringing him ""into the real world."" Well, it clearly doesn't work. The Gotham City of Tim Burton's film lived up to its name. Here, the movie could have just as easily taken place in Los Angeles. And this is really just a small complaint, but Batman's gadgets were hardly used. Where's his gas pellets during his escapes (like we saw demonstrated for him earlier in the film)? And the Batarangs were virtually missing in action. The action scenes, what few there are, were terrible. The MTV-style editing and camera work didn't help, practically drowning out any suspense and excitement they may have had. Half the time, I couldn't even tell what was going on and who was hitting who. And the excessive use of flashbacks in the first act made me feel like I was watching an episode of LOST.By the time the movie was over and I was heading out of the theater, I really didn't even feel like I had just seen a Batman movie, but something else entirely. It's really a shame. The film had lots of potential, and after eight years of waiting, this is all we get. It could have been something really good. I know everybody's raving about it, but I really didn't see the big deal. I thought it was pretty lackluster. Perhaps if the writer hadn't been David S. Goyer? Who knows? All I know is that I'm extremely disappointed. Of the four live-action Batman movies (not counting the one with Adam West), I guess I'd rank BATMAN BEGINS at Number 4, right behind BATMAN, BATMAN RETURNS, and even BATMAN FOREVER. It seems that SPIDER-MAN's place as the best superhero movie of all-time isn't likely to be challenged anytime soon.BATMAN BEGINS: 3/10"
190,"It does take a really really long time for Batman to appear as such in this film. The serious and dark theme of the movie ""fear"" is really hammered into the ground. The word ""fear"" must be used at least 50 times in the first 30 minutes of the movie and I don't know how many times after that. Bale makes a very good Bruce Wayne, but when he is ""finally"" in the Batsuit he does sort of a whisper shout line delivery which is sometimes way over the top. Of course being in the Batsuit is about kicking Bad guy ass. In this department we get confused shortish fight scenes against bad guys who obviously have no chance. The cast is full of good actors all of them have their moments, though that's about all they are allowed. Katie Holmes is miscast and not especially good in a not too well written part. Most of the special effects are very good, save a sort of ""island of the crazies"" part of town that looks like a big half rendered CG thing. This is too bad as much of the later part of the plot takes place here.Batman begins is a new start but it still has some of the problems of the last series and though it has a newish take on the material it's not so novel or convincing a take not to keep it being just a shade dull as we wait for the big scenes to arrive.SPOILER WARNING.Okay there's this whole segment in Tebet to somehow inspire Wayne to be Batman. This seems totally out of place really in the overall lore of Batman. But the thing is Wayne is afraid of bats. There is a very extensive use of flashbacks to how Bruce feels he killed his parents and this is connected to bats also, though I won't give that away I'm only giving enough info to explain my point. So in the Asian retreat section of the film there is talk of fear this fear that. It's all KUNG FU type dialog, but Wayne never makes the connection or assumes the role of Batman during this section. He only thinks of it, almost by accident after all this. Shouldn't they have tortured Wayne with bats to master his fear? They basically babble about fear and then kick his ass over and over that's the training. They don't follow through on their own fear concept they just repeat the basic concept over and over again. Set up an idea. Pay off the idea. That's what the audience is waiting for.Speaking of set up. It turns out that all the super gadgets that Batman has are just basically lying around in the basement of Wayne Enterprises headquarters. They just happened to make all this stuff for the military but never sold it. Sort of a happy accident isn't it? I don't know if this is convincing, though the new Batmobile is pretty cool its one big car chase scene is long but not too exciting.So they don't just happen to have Bat helmets in the basement. What is our hero to do. Well the plan is that they will order 10,000 of them from some military producer in Asia. They have to also order 10,000 helmet type things and 10,000 Bat ears with listening devices inside because this will somehow attract less attention. What? Can't they just make one bat helmet in their high tech sub basement where they made the prototype Batmobile. I guess not.Okay right at the start of the film a untrained Batman beats the crap out of either 6 or 7 guys depending on who you believe. So towards the end of the film the villain ( I won't say who that is) is confronted with Batman and is going to escape by leaving two Ninja type henchmen to fight Batman. Batman makes some remark about ""only two""? Suddenly two more super ninjas drop form the sky and the villain leaves. Okay, so what. He kicked the crap out of 6 guys before he knew anything. A short bad fight scene follows. Let me point out that Batman in several other scenes has easily beaten many more men than 4 men every time. If you set up a hero like this you need to also be able to set up real challenges for him and they don't.Finally the plot hinges around a rather shakily set up but decently paid off super weapon. The villain is racing on a train to the center of the city to turn it on and destroy everything. The device is the immediate and large danger and all you do is flip a switch to turn it on. There is no positive use for the device. Batman gets onto the moving train at last. What should he do? Destroy the device? All it would take it some good kicks to render it useless. Or does he engage the villain in a protracted fist fight. He doesn't even really try to stop the train--though he sort of does--I'm not here to give that away or ruin everything, just to mention odd gaps in the script that ruin some other good ideas. Batman fights and fight and fights and the device just sits there in the middle of the train car. Oh yeah the villain gets to mention fear a couple of times again in case we haven't figured that out by this point in the film now that it's almost over. Here in order to have an elaborate ""ticking clock"" ending they ignore a simple simple solution. Batman would break the machine and then kick the guys ass given the choice. And the screenplay gives him the choice which is the mistake."
191,"They should have called this movie Ninja-man. Seriously...why is Batman in this flick? At best, this is Hollywood hackery with all the loose ends tied up in a tidy little convoluted package. It takes Batman - who is such an obvious fantasy hero living in a fantasy world - and tries to spread him over real life. The result is embarrassing to behold. Act I feels like a tasteless film noir riff on The Last Samauri. Act II is downright insulting - every single major player loses common sense to an almost surreal extinct. Act III is basically Die Hard IV: Die Batman Die. Now, this is coming from someone who loved, loved, loved MEMENTO and INSOMNIA, as well as Tim Burton's BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS.As bad as BATMAN AND ROBIN was - at least it wasn't pretentious. The soundtrack sounds like it was cobbled together from various faceless, forgettable Action Movie Trailers. It is utterly soulless...but that matches Bruce Wayne's (non)character. Wayne is supposed to be clever - a scientist! Here, he comes off like a frat boy with a silver spoon in his mouth and a chip on his shoulder. Instead of appearing mysterious, he is inexplicable and unaccountable if not simply an utter dolt. Batman Begins exhibits a one-dimensional Bruce Wayne unconvincingly leading a double-life. At times, he borders on non-dimensional. I've got some advice for the producers of this film - re-title this thing The League of Shadows, cut out your half-baked ""Batman"" subplot, compose an actual score and you'd have just another Bad American Action Movie rather than a Pretentiously, Embarrassingly ""Serious"" Comic Book Bastardization. To be fair, this movie does have about 15 minutes of interesting material. I'm sure it makes for a great trailer. But the rest is Bat droppings. Sorry fans, I really wanted to dig this flick. I hate to rain on the parade of praise rolling in for this thing. I'm glad so many of you enjoyed this and I wish I could share in your enthusiasm. I'm just trying to warn readers like myself to lower their expectations."
192,"I'm sure you've read other people's reviews, so I'll spare the plot details. As I watched this movie, I decided that two words accurately describe it -- disturbing and boring. These aren't two words that usually go together, but batman begins was at times tedious and at times truly frightening. The scary parts remind me of Jacob's Ladder. The scarecrow gives people a dose of a hallucinogenic drug that causes victims to see the most frightening things imaginable. The way this is portrayed on screen so strangely and so often had me just wanting to leave. This is definitely not for young children. I think the director had some bad acid trips and decided he'd make these real for everyone with his multi-million dollar budget. The parts that weren't disturbing were slow and tedious. Repeated shots of young Bruce being traumatized. There was nothing uplifting about this movie. I'm not a fan of artificial comic relief (and there wasn't much of that) but I just kept waiting for some element of happiness to appear and it never did. If you're not a fan of the comics, I would say avoid this. I left the theater feeling worse than when I went in."
193,"Here's what I liked about this movie:- I liked Gary Oldman as Sgt Gordon, he acted very well in a part that really didn't give him all that much to do. I liked Morgan Freeman, it was nice to show how Bruce Wayne acquired all his ""toys"" for Batman. I liked Rutger Hauer, but the story behind him working for someone else really didn't come out at all, just a ""stolen microwave"" thing. His character could have had so much more to do. He would have been an excellent pawn in the baddies master plan. I liked Micheal Caine, excellent as Alfred. I liked Christian Bale but I really didn't believe him as Batman, sorry. Not enough trauma and too much showing of him going bad.OK, here's what I didn't like. I didn't like Liam Neeson pretending to be a bad Jedi/Sith again. Liam, you died in the Star Wars series - get over it! Let's train Bruce Wayne in the art of Ninjitsu (supposedly takes a life time but Bruce is only away from Gotham for 7 years?) and teach him to be a force for good but when he questions his teacher about ethics and morality they suddenly want to kill him? Er, WTF?Newly trained ""ninja"" Bruce Wayne defeats a whole room full of people who were teaching him - I Think NOT! If you've seen the trailer then you've seen the best bits of this film. If the police chasing the Batmobile looks familiar then it should do, thats Lower Whacker Drive in Chicago, used in The Blues Brothers over 20 years ago.The creators of this film thought "" Right, lets use tons of stuff out of Batman comic books"" - This is of no use to those of us who don't read Batman comics is it? Most of us are going to know Batman from previous films or the old TV series. Yes, we know The Joker, The Riddler, The Penguin. Scarecrow - who the hell is he then? No explanation behind why he's The Scarecrow, what made him this way - how he got the name. The whole ""have you seen my mask?"" and the voice changer inside along with the hallucogenic drugs still don't explain how or why he became Scarecrow.The attempt (And it was damn feeble) to explain how Bruce becomes Batman and chooses the nickname. ""I'm scared of bats so I think i'll use a bat"". He was attacked by bats. NO HE WASN'T! He fell down a well and spooked some bats who tried to fly away from him, there was no attack, just bats fleeing from a perceived threat. (Oh and real bats wouldn't fly anywhere near a person, they have excellent radar so whoever did the computer generated bats did NO research into how bats fly)Sounds pretty normal but nothing like an attack, eh? Adult Bruce goes down the well with no torch but finds a torch which seems to just appear in his hand like magic. No attack from the bats again? No, of course not. That'd be far too damn sensible. The flashbacks that seem fairly useless, we don't really see why Bruce is arrested. Stealing stuff that belongs to Wayne Industries. Not really theft is it, especially once they've asked him what his name is?The appearance of Liam Neeson in the prison cell. We've put Bruce Wayne into solitary to protect other prisoners who you were fighting with but this hasn't been deemed serious enough to warrant any further prison time, we'll just release you like we were going to.The whole ""people spooked by gas that makes them scared and insane"" just looks like a scene from a Romero film, them shuffling along like Night Of The Living Dead.The girl whose supposed to be insane from gas but sits meekly in a strange fast traveling vehicle. She doesn't recognize Bruce Wayne's voice until near the end of the film, despite the fact they were childhood playmates. No, I don't think so. Plus Bruce already had the cure and he didn't carry it with him when he went to save her? The reason for her being in the house isn't explained? I assume her mother works for the Wayne family. Why do they take Bruce to the opera at all? Why do they leave by the back door?We aren't supposed to question this person killing Bruce's parents when we already know about Jack Napier (aka The Joker) from a previous film.Watch the film and forget about the plot. There isn't really MUCH actual plot to forget about but if you just watch the action and enjoy the fights and the gadgets and The Batmobile then you will love this film. Turn off your brain.The fact that The Batmobile has to jump into The Batcave but it looks like it would be physically impossible for it to jump out. Lets paint the Batsuit black but it's black already - why? Two guys get into an elevator in a fire - the most dangerous thing you can do. Really smart message to the kids, ignore the danger warnings - lifts are safe in a fire if you need to get down from somewhere.The plot of the film gets a 2/10, the action gets a 5/10."
194,"This is the only Batman movie where the villains are not just complete losers but are also completely pointless. How can even begin to compare a mostly non-existent Scarecrow to the Joker in the first movie? The first half was pretty decent if not extremely unrealistic and highly questionable. At the end, there are too many things thrown together, making little sense. Its all one big bloody mess. There is no real plot in this movie.Bruce Wayne's character was completely ruined by bad acting not to mention ridiculous scenes. As batman, he did little fighting and comes out as a complete idiot. In one scene where Katie Holme's character pepper sprays someone, Batman is seen molesting...er...fighting in the background. It really does look like molestation. The second half of this movie is atrocious and total crap. The sets used are also crap."
195,"Batman Begins is a muddled mess. It begins with an hour long origin story, which is almost identical to the origin story in The Shadow  which is not a great film, but is a better film than this one. In this version of Batman's origin, Ras Al Ghul trains Bruce Wayne to cloud men's minds/fight evil, with brief flashbacks to the traditional Batman origin. Sadly, while Bruce impresses Ras with his ability, he never impresses the audience. He beats up a bunch of people, but we never see how he does it. He never makes any really cool moves. We just see a flurry of arms and legs and then a bunch of people have been knocked down and Bruce is still standing. Nothing about the plot even begins to make sense, and none of the cool stuff we've been waiting for and hoping for ever happens.Rick Norwood, sfsite"
196,"This movie tarnishes the Batman legend forever. Even Robin wouldn't like this piece of cinematic guano.Christian Bale is no Batman. His raspy whisper is more hysterical than menacing. How can they let something so patently foolish leave the studio? At the very least they could have dubbed in some more sinister... like Porky Pig. He's easily the weakest of all Batmans. Adam West looks good by comparison.The chemistry is missing between and among the cast. They never seem comfortable with who and/what they are supposed to be. The interaction is stiff; the humor is forced. This could kill a couple of careers... or so one hopes.The story is weak. We all know Batman's origins, the details could have been worked through more expeditiously and knocked a tedious hour or so off of this monstrosity. By the time this film muddled towards climax, I didn't care how it ended---I just wanted that damn thing over. And when it was over, I just wanted my money back. My second disappointment of the day as it turns out. I guess theaters don't do that any more."
197,"This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching. It was so bad, I felt the need to write this. There were just so many things wrong with this movie...KATIE HOLMES. She cannot act. I always thought she was a decent actress based on the few episodes of ""Dawson's Creek"" I've regretfully seen, but her performance in this movie was on a Britney Spears-Crossroads level of bad. Also, in practically every scene, Katie Holmes appears to be a little chilly (if you catch my drift), and it is so noticeable that I felt the need to throw it in.EVERYONE ELSE'S ACTING. Christian Bale's performance was a disappointment also. His tone and the movement of his lips reminded me of Donald Trump. And honestly, I feel like Donald Trump probably would have done a better job than Christian Bale in this role. Seriously, it's that bad. The ONLY good actors in the movie were the veterans -- Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. They are way beyond this movie.THE SCRIPT. This movie delivered some of the worst and most corny lines I have ever heard in a movie. Seriously, I laughed out loud at some of the things that were said. Liam Neeson had the worst lines of all. I understood maybe three things he said. The rest of what he had to say included all sorts of odd metaphors, or was just unimportant.THE CAMERA WORK. I was so confused about who was being slapped, shot, punched, etc. The editing was done too quickly so that the film was jumpy, and that was one of the reasons that it was so hard to differentiate who was getting hit. In addition, the camera angles were tight.Aside from all the negatives, Cillian Murphy was scary. He would be standing idle, and I would get chills. He was good as the villain -- very creepy. I also found the preface to be really random and unnecessary.In conclusion, don't waste your money or time on this movie. I wish God would refund me the 2 hours and 21 minutes of my life that was wasted seeing this movie."
198,"Is this what passes for a slick comic book movie these days? A movie so attached to the concept of being dark, gloomy and melodramatic that it has forgotten somewhere along the way to entertain us? Movies like this are what happens when producers insist on pandering to fanboys. In an obvious attempt to give the 18-35 male demographic exactly what they pine for, this movie features a lot of mindless combat (hastily edited to avoid the need for any complex choreography), a marginal plot, a lot of wasted talent and a protagonist who literally scratches his own voice in a futile attempt to appear 'tough' inside a latex suit.The result is a cumbersome movie that looks and sounds a lot like a dark oily calliope. The batman suit in this one is laughably bad, the assistant DA looks and sounds more like a high school prom date and Michael Caine looks as bored as he did in Jaws III.A lot of rain, some interesting cinematography here and there and some stolen camera tricks from another horror film, make Batman Begins slightly more than awful, but in summary this movie isn't fun, it isn't that violent, it's very convoluted and really strains your attention span. The strain on your attention span would be more than forgivable if it was used to develop character, plot and mood, but instead it's mostly used to just wheeze itself along like a big, rusty tank.Batman is supposed to be dark, supposed to be violent and in many ways is supposed to represent the ultimate Nietzsche/Fascist fantasy. Batman is a character that owns everything and then physically beats up anyone who tries to steal anything from the very city he owns lock, stock and barrel. You can work with that premise to weave in all kinds of interesting themes, ideas and stories, best exemplified with such comic books as Arkham Asylum and Killing Joke.Here it just plays out like some giant, rainy offering to fanboys everywhere. It leaves the rest of us bored and pining for the days when action films weren't a dime a dozen and weren't this bloated and cumbersome.All I ask is a dumb movie like this provide a few laughs and thrills to go along with our bucket of popcorn. Instead I got something that took itself too seriously but then provided so little substance in return for its gravitas."
199,"Where Memento was psychologically deep and engulfing, Batman Begins is shallow and repetitive. Chris Nolan's breakout masterpiece Memento showed us that he could tell a story that keeps us riveted and constantly guessing through unique editing and story telling techniques. However, Batman Begins flowed poorly. I commend Nolan for not using the quick flashy editing techniques of directors like Guy Ritchie, but his more subdued style failed to engage me. The placement of the flashback sequences were jarring, and failed to move the plot forward in an interesting way.Unlike the Spiderman films, Nolan failed in creating sympathy for both the hero and the villains. The story is a classic battle between good and evil, but I found it too simple. The film attempted to engage us in a good dialog about the reasons for crime and corruption and how poverty is both a symptom and a cause of both. Unfortunately, it was grossly simplified for the sake of mass consumption. I do not believe this is Nolan's fault as I doubt he had final cut status for the film. In general, Hollywood underestimates the intelligence of the movie going public and tends to just throw explosions and nudity at them in place of good plot. Though there was no nudity in this film, I feel that this film did not fulfill it's full potential for the sake of more action. A good discussion about crime and evil would have given Bruce Wayne believable motivation for becoming Batman. The whole ""a burglar shot my parents"" motive could have been done better. I had a hard time empathizing with Bruce Wayne as a result.The acting in the film was as good as the dialog allowed. I always find Liam Neeson's acting rather poor, and this film was no exception. Neeson's character in this was only slightly different from that of his character in Star Wars Episode I. I found his character and the whole ""league of shadows"" very cheesy.In general I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
200,"Bale is unintentionally funny as Batman doing his, now infamous Bat-Voice. More silly than intimidating.The dialogue has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer and is delivered in the most melodramatic way possible.Take a shot every time the word ""fear"" or variation of it is said. You'll be drunk 30 minutes in.Direction is average at best, shoddy at worst.But, at least Batman fanboys got what they wanted."
201,"Let me begin by say that I am a Bat-freak, and I have read most Frank Miller stories. Having said that, I felt that Goyer's Batman Begins script comes off like a sloppy forgery of Miller's Batman: Year One miniseries (down to lifting the last scene with the Joker's playing card), with villains inappropriately thrown-in. The Bat-Tank is an idea from Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns and it is also tossed in, not to assist the story, but to pander to a motor-crazy American culture in a moment of pimp-my-Batmoblie obviously inserted in the script by a Warner Bros. marketing team after reviewing last year's Hummer sales.I don't mean to totally hate-on a film without cause, after all this IS a step above the Joel Schumacher versions of the Dark Knight, but only slightly. This film has none of the visual resonance or thrilling pleasure of Tim Burton's Batman movies, also Katie Holmes' character is used to twice rip-off the Burton movies. Most offensive was at the end when a familiar line is used, badly, to reveal that Bruce is the Bat to the female lead, which is exactly like the mistletoe line in Batman Returns only much more lame. So lets say I was still expecting better, and I also felt that many of the 'jokes' that were designed to relieve the tension fell flat, like Gordon seeing the Bat-Tank and saying 'I gotta get me one of those.' I did like Garry Oldman's version of Lt. Gordon, but he wasn't used in any interesting such as the personal crisis Gordon faces in Miller's Year One. For me, Nolan's style for capturing the fight sequences was a total misfire, as you could rarely see a single landed impact through the over-editing. ASIDE FROM NOT BEING THE DEFINITIVE BATMAN MOVIE, IT IS JUST NOT A GOOD MOVIE PERIOD. I wasn't expecting perfection, just an enjoyable evening in Gotham City and they didn't even give me that. I had read some reviews asserting that Frank Miller fans and the Sin City crowd will be satisfied with this one, which can't be the case. If Warner Bros. wanted to make the Frank Miller people happy than they would have done a film of the real Batman: Year One with Darren Aronofsky directing, as originally planned 3½ years ago. Also, everyone was saying how serious and realistic this film was, and yet the climax of the film was so overwrought with separate elements that it became laughable. Goyer's attempts to clumsily tie the too-many strands of this film together with a death-train headed straight for the Wayne Enterprises building which will poison and evaporate all the water in Gotham within an instant. Come on, we can do better than this. This is a horrible idea for the ending of any movie, and to me is comparable in many ways to the very silly ending of Batman Forever.I found Nolan and Goyer did not learn from the mistakes of Schumacher, electing not to emphasise a single villain and instead orchestrating a rather lame pageant of familiar characters without focusing on any of them. In Batman Begins, the genocidal cult-leader Ra's Al Ghul isn't the charismatic megalomaniac as he is in the comics and cartoons and the Scarecrow is limited to an Arkham administrator / mob chemist. I am a dedicated DC comics guy, however if this is any indication of the type of DC films that are on their way into theatres, then Marvel has already won the biggest battle of them all. Both the Spider-Man and X-men films were far superior to Batman Begins, and in particular Spider-Man 2 had compelling action with a story that featured the allegorical properties of the superhero. I am sorry to report that Batman Begins offers us nothing more than action sequences which are obscured by 'stylish' editing in an endlessly hollow feature."
202,Cheese and snooze fest with horrible one liners littered everywhere. Predictable storyline without any real character development.Probably Bale's worst role.
203,"They tried to make Batman into Spiderman. This has got to be one of the worst ideas in the history of poorly adapted comic book movies, and I've seen ""Elektra,"" people.Director Christopher Nolan said he wanted to take Batman in a different direction when he was chosen to relaunch the franchise. He didn't say the direction was straight down, though. He also said he wanted to use Frank Miller's ""Batman: Year One"" storyline as a model for the new film. If he was telling the truth, he would've admitted he was actually using the fantastic and very good ""Spiderman"" films as the model for the new film. There's just one big problem. Spiderman isn't Batman. In 60 years of history no one ever told Batman ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" or ""It's not who you are underneath, it's what you do that defines you."" Batman sees ridding the world of crime as his personal mission, everything else in life is irrelevant. Most of all, Batman does NOT believe in the inherent good of Gotham City's legal and criminal justice institutions. Batman is a vigilante. Batman kills criminals as judge, jury and executioner. In a word, Batman is the anti-Spiderman in every way, shape and form. That's why this movie is awful and why most comic book movies just don't measure up. It's the old Hollywood saw of ""monkey see, monkey do."" Well, Sam Raimi has made millions making those everyday accessible Spiderman films, why don't we just make the new Batman film like that? Maybe because Batman isn't accessible. Sam Raimi has actually READ the Spiderman comics and knows why the accessible approach works for that character. It HAS worked for that character for 50 years. Batman is the polar opposite. But Christopher Nolan wouldn't know that, because it's obvious he's never read a Batman comic book. I conclude this because he said he wanted to emulate ""Batman: Year One"" but instead made an anti-vigilante movie. It's good that directors watch other directors and take note of what's successful in movies, but it's gotten to the point in today's Hollywood that that's ALL they watch. Their frame of reference is only as big as the local megaplex. Maybe that's why the water contamination plot of ""Batman Begins"" was lifted whole from 1989's ""Batman: The Motion Picture."" So Nolan essentially didn't create ANYTHING new with ""Batman Begins."" Instead he made a Frankenstein's monster out of pieces of other films. Hear's the pitch: Let's take the personal responsibility theme of ""Spiderman"" and add the poisoning of Gotham plot of ""Batman."" We'll get Morgan Freeman to act as a sort of Q character from the James Bond films to give Batman his suit, weapons and car so everything has a tidy explanation. We can even turn Batman's father (never a heavily-explored character in the comics) into an Uncle Ben figure, like in those boffo Spiderman films. Liam Neeson's (Ducart/Ra's Al-Ghul) performance is the best in the film and comes very close to saving this hodgepodge but even he can't rise above the muck that is the script. He and Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow/Dr. Crane) as usual, have the best parts as villains. But undermining all their good work is the other Hollywood conceit of having to make everything ""real."" Scarecrow wears a three-piece suit and only dons his mask when scaring people. Shouldn't we be in Gotham City where the rules of our world don't always apply? You want me to believe these people find it entirely acceptable that Batman runs around in his well-explained armor but it would be ENTIRELY out of the realm of possibility that Scarecrow has, oh I dunno, a Scarecrow suit? This is supposed to be a comic book movie, people. It's supposed to be fun. That's why the need to ""explain"" where every Bat weapon, vehicle and suit came from is so ridiculously out of place. No one asked how Spiderman made his spidey suit and we didn't see Superman knitting his baby blankets into a Supes outfit in either of their good comic book movies. It's not important, let it go. In fact, Let Morgan Freeman go. You're overpaying for one of the world's best actors so he can deliver plot contrivance and exposition. If it's that hard to shoehorn your exposition in that you need AN ENTIRE NEW CHARACTER for it, then your plot is probably too contrived in the first place. Or, if you insist on Morgan Freeman, give him a better role. Gary Oldman is great as Sergeant Jim Gordon, maybe if he had a comparable actor playing the corrupt police commissioner the two could really go at it and chew some scenery. Instead, you've put Q in a Batman movie. I guess Christian Bale REALLY wants that 007 role. Supposedly, the Fantastic Four movie is just as bad, reducing the rich, dynamic character that is Dr. Doom into a one-dimensional megalomaniac. It's stuff like this that's made box office receipts drop %18 this year because all these comic book movies are tent poles for the studios. Christopher Nolan, Ang Lee (Hulk) Mark Steven Johnson (Daredevil), Rob Bowman (Elektra) and David Goyer (writer of Batman Begins) should not be allowed to adapt comic books in the future. If they do, Bryan Singer (X-Men, X-Men II) and Sam Raimi should sit them down and FORCE them to read the comic books they're adapting and not just watch their movies."
204,"I just got back from Batman Begins. I'm very confused.Not from the story, characters, ending, or anything technical. I am confused by my own emotions. I feel like a symbolic Two-Face.On one side, I want to give this thing 10 out of 10. It was awesome.But on the other side, I would wipe myself with it. Allow me to get down to business.GOOD: 1: The cinematography is AWESOME 2: Good CGI, can barely tell (if at all) 3: Dark. Very good, with the exception of Adam West, campy Batmans don't do it 4: Very deep, serious.5: Provides background as to why Batman can kick so much ass.6: Scarecrow done MUCH better than I expected.7: They made Batman SCARY and INTIMIDATING, which has always fallen short.8: Christian Bale did a great job at the intimidation with Batman.BONUS: Alfred grabbed a golf club when he ran into the house to help. I found that hilarious and awesome.BONUS 2: The very end. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I won't say anymore.BAD: 1: The fight scenes SUCK. They all cut way too fast, and too much to know what's going on.2: Hypocrisy. Bruce Wayne doesn't want to kill a murderer...but has nothing against killing about 50 guys two seconds later who fight injustice.3: While it was darker, it still wasn't a ""Dark Knight"". They should have made Batman a killer, much like he was when he first came around (in the first appearance of Batman he threw a baddie into a vat of toxic waste) 4: The new Batmobile is completely stupid. It's kinda cool...but logically WAY too much for any man (even a bat man) to need. The pivotal Batmobile is from Tim Burton's BATMAN.5: Still no explanation how the Wayne family is friggin' rich. A business, yeah...but still no reasoning why they're so rich.6: Scarecrow was HEAVILY under-developed. Barely in the movie enough. Not to mention Scarecrow's ""defeat"" at the end of the movie is the funniest thing I've ever seen in a Batman movie.7: I didn't feel any connection between Bruce and Rachel. They were childhood friends...and that's where the connection stops for me. Did I mention the fight scenes were bad? 8: When I first heard Christian's voice as Batman, I laughed. Not a good sign. He seemed to be trying too hard to try to become a different person when in the suit. He also did not look like a Bruce Wayne to me. I know there's much more than looking the part (George Clooney comes to mind), but it's a factor. He seemed too emotionless, detached. Christian is a good actor and I saw it...but it seems he fell short. Michael Keaton still holds the reigned for the most intense and perfect Bruce Wayne AND Batman.BONUS: The ending seemed a bit pushy (even if I did orgasm at it). But it was confusing for my friend. He was questioning if it was to show that it was a prequel to the Batman '89 movie. I explained that they were starting over. But still, I can see how people could be confused. Personally I'd leave the first two Batman movies in the timeline and redo Forever and Batman and Robin.Even looking back, I don't' know what to say. One thing, it's an awesome and excellent movie. Another, it's mediocre at best.I'll give it 6 out of 10. You might love it...you might not."
205,One of the most overatted movie ever just one time watchable.
206,"I wanted to like it, honestly!I've been a huge Batman Fan all my life. And yes I still have a copy of Batman Year One. Love it. But unfortunately....Take a seemingless endless budget, and allstar cast, great special effects, set design, costume design, and add in a monkey for a script writer / director. What do you get? A movie a bunch of hopefull Batman fans go to, and end up grimacing at every line of dialog. You get a movie that is trying hard to be a psychological thriller, but seems to have been written by a 8 year old. The movie lacks any consistency, and any real understanding of what it is trying to do. By then end of the movie, you are stuck wondering , what the bleep was the point of any of this!?!??! You get a beautiful to watch, yet, literally painful to follow mess.What happened? In earlier Batman movies Burton went for a more campy vision of Batman. Well the fans wanted something darker, something along the lines for the more realistic ""Batman: Year One"". So Hollywood decides to cash in on another attempt at Batman, in the height of the whole Comic book movie craze. And someone decided this meant diving into Bruce Wayne's psyche, and showing his ""transition"" to Batman. In Burton's Batman, they just showed enough of a story we all know and let us settle the rest in our imagination. In Nolan's version everything is so blatant yet not thought out enough to stop it from completely contradicting itself. We are beat over the head again and again with Wayne's inner conflicts. There are several excellent ideas throughout the fill that just keep falling flat on their face, either because of not getting fleshed out properly, or just simply from contradicting themselves. Little about the movie makes any sense, from the characters philosophies, to training with live metal swords and no head gear. Burton's movies were at least consistent. They worked within themselves, creating a world that gelled together. He stayed true to his vision of Batman, and came up with some solid, consistent movies. With Batman begins, expect to go from a great scene, to sitting there and just thinking, what the bleep did I just see. The scenes with a child Bruce Wayne are just painfully bad. Expect no consistency, no vision, no cohesive story.So what is this film worth? It is a typical shallow action based comic book hero movie with little true substance behind it. Expect ridiculous leaps of faith as far as what is physically ""possible"", expect stupid car chases where the ""hero"" almost gets dozens of people killed and tears of the city, expect anything but a good story.Production value 9/10. Story and script 2/10. Overall 4/10."
207,"What an awful movie I went into this with the highest of expectations, after reading all the glowing reviews, and boy, was I disappointedCome back Michael Keaton, all is forgiven. Tim Burton, you are a visionary.C Nolan-- what oh what were you thinkingEvery possible cliché, every possible stupidity was in this movieIt was almost as bad as Spiderman (though saved from that ignominy by the absence of a ""new-york solidarity"" scene.The only saving grace was Michael Caine, who delivered the best line (What's the point of all those push ups if you can't even move a block of wood off you"").Christian Bale tried hard, but had dire material to work with. Katie Holmes-- why was she in this movie?There seemed to be a desire to turn Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes into longtime sweethearts- but the flashbacks showed only the minimum of interaction, so when Rachel says ""the man I loved you're left wondering-- when exactly did you love this man??????Liam Neeson-- totally wasted Morgan Freeman-- in it for the money and proud of it, another highlight ins this abysmal movie Gary Oldman--??????????I know everyone's been raving about the car-- but after watching fast cars in another awful movie (The Fast and the Furious), for me the Batmobile lumbered like a tank, and didn't fly like a bat!Yes some ideas were amusing, and some even clever, but overall the dialogue was substandard, and the lack of style unforgivable.Tim Burton's Batman was the best-- Batman and Batman Returns will remain the defining movies for this comic-book world"
208,"As much as I like a good Batman film, this one wasn't really the best one made.I was able to spot several problems with this movie, and I'll be more than happy to point them out.The first of many was that they put too much emphasis on modernizing Batman: if you're going to deal with a classic character, you must think classic. The tank-looking bat-mobile... need I say more? Secondly, Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow's origin was never discussed, thus leaving people that don't know about the legend clueless.Also, the continual mentioning of the city's water supply and the neurotoxic gas was slightly annoying.Finally, the one element that they forgot was the one thing that Tim Burton nailed dead-on: humor! There was no shred of humor to keep this thing together. Even Forrest Gump was a drama, but it managed to be funny too; this on the other hand, took itself way too seriously.To finalize, for Batman fans everywhere, this isn't really one that I'd recommend."
209,"I must be one of the only people in the U.S. that hates this movie. Not just dislikes, but HATES. That's right; I despise this flick. Let me explain why...When I was in high school, Tim Burton's Batman came out in theaters. I remember it being one of the most enjoyable movie-going experiences of my life. Goofy bat-props aside, it was epic, colorful, and operatic. It was what any true comic book movie should aspire to. I still consider Burton's movie the best superhero movie ever made. Yep, you heard me right.I will be the first to admit that went into Christopher Nolan's version with a biased opinion. How could Nolan, a director known for Hitchcock-like suspense movies, ever beat Burton's dark vision? After viewing Batman Begins, it turns out I was right to question everything I had heard about it. This movie sucks.Nolan is best left to directing off-kilter thrillers. Given his unique directing style, I have to admit that I was excited to find out that he was going to be helming this one. Unfortunately, he shows none of the originality that seeps through in his other flicks like Memento and The Prestige. How can such a good director turn out uninspired, boring schlock like this? Batman Begins is so ham-fisted and pretentious that I felt like I had been forced into watching a Baptist tent revival for two hours. The characters love sermonizing about ""good vs. evil"" and ""morality vs. immorality"". Especially Katie Holmes and Michael Caine. Now, I am a big fan of Caine's work (I won't even comment on Holmes; how she got cast in this movie is beyond me), but turning Alfred into a nagging I-Told-You-So moralist is completely aggravating. David S. Goyer should be smacked for writing such pandering drivel.I am a huge fan of Christian Bale. I have a ton of his movies in my collection. I had big hopes for his turn as the Caped Crusader. He is the only actor in this movie that even pretends to care about what is going on, despite his very wooden performance. Gary Oldman is one of my favorite thespians of all time, but he was a braindead zombie throughout the whole flick. Ditto for Holmes, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, and Ken Watanabe. How could so many great actors sleepwalk through one production? It's all mindboggling.The whole thing feels like a project that had a ton of energy at the beginning, but everyone involved slowly lost interest and just decided to finish it so they could collect their paychecks. Very Sad. This had such huge potential, and it turned out to be just another Hollywood cash cow.There were some highlights for me, though. The final train showdown was really cool, as was the appearance a psychopathic Scarecrow on the streets of Gotham looking like one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse.Ultimately, Batman Begins is marred by poor scriptwork, poor direction, and even poorer acting. I am consistently amazed by reviews that herald it as ""the movie of the year"" or ""the best superhero movie ever made"". Uggh.I'll stick to Zebraman, thank you very much. At least that has some creativity to it."
210,"I honestly don't remember the last time I was more disappointed in a movie. There is absolutely no action worth mentioning in this entire film. The fight scenes are choppy and VERY VERY poorly done. I feared this might be the case with a rookie action director in charge but I never thought a Batman film would fall this low in terms of fight content. The set up is long and often tedious and the dialogue is surprisingly ""New Star Wars"" bad. Even the bast costume itself looks off. They were promising us more flexibility and believability with this design but it still looked awkward. Keaton's original still looks better. Bale was remarkably average as Bruce Wayne and his ""Batman voice"" is near laughable.It pains me to say but Batman Begins should change its name to Batman Disappoints."
211,"I have never fallen asleep in the cinema in my life! I thought this film looked pretty good and the cast was impressive, plus i loved the first 4 Batman films but i fell asleep like 20 minutes in and didn't wake till near the end. I guess i can't really comment but i think a movie that puts you to sleep that fast isn't worth spending money on. Plus the story was pretty awful the 'villan' was dumb and it just didn't have anything like the other films. I like the whole fantasy edge to Batman and the way the villains are formed (Joker with the acid, Catwoman with the cats etc) the film has none of this. The continuation from the original Batman was dumb as it was clear that the joker killed Batman's parents yet in this he does not? Basically save your money!"
212,"I saw Batman Begins and i was very-very disappointing. I thought Nolan was a credible direction and Bale a credible actor but alas the movie sucks big time... Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) trains Batman to sword fighting like he's a bloody Jedi. The film is boring as hell. What Thibet has to do with Batman? They try to put some deeper meaning and all ""a person is not what he feels inside, but what his actions make"" but it's not worthy. Bale actor is great to play nerd types, (Velvet Goldmine, Lauren Canyon), he was OK in American Psycho but as Batman he is not very good. Michael Cane is the best as English butler and Morgan Freeman is typical as good guy again. Liam Neeson, a great actor, was much better in Phantom Menace, his performance here is disappointing. Bad plot, the worst bad guys ever, action scenes are very bad too. Tim Burton's films was much much better. Even Catwoman, a terrible movie, was in some ways superior than this crap."
213,"I was very interested in seeing this movie after the Tim Burton kind of Batman movies. I am not a real Batfan: I don't know much about the comic books and I just expected to see a great ""fantasy"" movie with interesting characters. Burton's movies were great. I knew that it will be darker now, but it was much more boring. It's an average big budget action flick. The writer and the director has no idea about a SUPERHERO: we got an average action hero of the Nicholas Cage/Steven Seagal type in a bat-suit. However, I haven't seen The Dark Knight movie with Heath Ledger yet and I still hope that it will be more exciting. See my comment there."
214,"I'd think 16 years later more people would start recognizing this for the campiness that it is. Give me lame special effects over this quick-editing mess that doesn't even try to show Batman's abilities on the screen.Other than the editing, what is really dragging this movie down is the scene where Batman saves the girl from the high-dosage of poison. ""She doesn't have long"" turns into a 10+ minute unnecessary delay. I feel bad for Katie Holmes who had to act out fear and dying for 10 minutes, with nothing to do but sit in a car. Why didn't Batman carry a spare dosage of anecdote with him? Because this Batman is stupid, that's why.So the Bats just spent 7 years learning how to be invisible. Now that he has escaped the building and is unseen in the alley, he decides to get inside his large conspicuous bat-tank and lead a chase throughout the city while news helicopters film him. After causing the destruction of several police cars (nice heroics, Batman), he gets on an unpaved road and drives straight to his batcave in the rain. As if the police can't follow the tracks of an 8-wheel tank in the mud. Sooooooooo stupid.Now that Batman, as Bruce Wayne, is at his birthday party, he is surprised by Ras Al Ghul. Why Rassy decides to reveal himself is beyond me, it goes against everything the character stood for in the first 30 minutes.And Bruce Wayne, who defeated Ras the first time because he used a distraction, cannot beat Ras on Bruce's home turf. Bruce didn't install anything in his OWN HOME that would be useful in a fight situation? Turns out he learned literally nothing in 7 years' training.Also, love how Bruce just stood there watching goons pour gasoline in his home and light it on fire. LMAO. If he had fought them before the fire, he probably could have won, captured Ras, and kept his house from being destroyed. (And since the goons escaped we now have a loose end of 4+ people who know Batman's identity and this is never addressed.)The film shows Scarecrow fear by using a shaky and blurry camera reminiscent of the low-budget Blair Witch Project. Katie Holmes defeats the Scarecrow with just a taser (btw, where was her taser during the first encounter with the Scarecrow?) The fear-struck drugged citizens that are supposed to be rioting are like slow-walking zombies that do no damage.""I won't kill you but I don't have to save you"", what a line, what a line. It's not like Batman orchestrated the removal of the train's tracks and then incapacitated Rassy so he couldn't quickly escape. From this angle, Batman's character arch went from saving his nemeses to murdering them.The only saving grace in this movie is that Katie Holmes gets Bats to reveal his identity, and then she rejects him. Hilarious."
215,"By that, I mean one that everyone talks about will be so great, and one you wait for and know it'll be something excellent. But then as it is finally time to light, it turns out to be a great big dud.I expected something good, something new. We're talking about the Beginning of Batman, obviously enough. What I saw was a great big budget completely wasted on a script that wasn't written all that great. It moves so fast that ten minutes into the film so much has happened and you're left questionable to what the hell is even going on yet. I believe the term is Push-Plot, where they wanted to just skip all the boring scenes that would take their time and have plenty of room for the Deleted and Extended scenes section of what you know will be a special edition two-disk DVD set like every other comic adaptation.So much happens and so fast that it really did feel like the film makers decided to cut the only ten seconds of action from every well written scene and decided to just paste moment after moment to the point where you see so many jumps that it nearly gets annoying trying to catch up with what happened twenty seconds ago compared to what the hell is happening now. It left me and the few I was with very confused and looking around to mutter ""wait, what just happened? Now he's over there ... now he's back.. What just happened??"" and the little action there was, like a big firework, promised much and then delivered dully and barely enough to keep the viewers entertained.Something most might be disappointed on is the fact that this was not a film as promised that goes back to the original comics. But in reality it's a now-days presentation of what the comics would be, had they been written only a year ago by a guy who only had somewhat of a cool idea for a new comic character who dresses as a bat. If anything, it only steals from other newly comic adapted movies, like Spider-man and Superman (with starting him out with a lame costume, and saying Bruce Wayne is the mask Batman hides behind.) and alike all the other previous made Batman movies, hell, even leading back to the old TV show, This just seemed like a movie that wanted as many Big-Name Hollywood stars to be the cast as they could. Don't get me wrong, Bale plays an excellent Batman when he has the chance, and it's not his fault the writing was bad. The villain (Cillian, the Scarecrow) was one of the best characters, and his screen-time was seen more in the previews than it even was throughout the whole film!Over all it was an utterly predictable movie, with too much fast action and not enough plot to enjoy or even understand what's going on half the time. My biggest complaint is the bat-mobile .. What the hell was the point of making it some lame kind of tank? While the other films got very in-touch with fantasy, and maybe too much even, this was a film that the makers wanted to make a little Too real, and it ended up coming out as an even bigger joke than the rest. It's truly sad to say that the previous films, including the so horrible Batman and Robin was even put together more well than this one was. It's reasons like this that the great Tim Burton backed away from the series, and we all know that's true.** 2 out of 10. Save your money, wait for it to come on cable instead."
216,"""Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?""So sayeth Jack Nicholson in a riveting performance as The Joker in an earlier film about the caped crusader. There is not a line, a performance, a character, a joke or an idea that comes close to matching that single piece of sublime brilliance here. Burton's ""Batman"" of 1989 had class. It had vision. It had style. It had character. Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" is the antithesis of that former picture in almost every conceivable way. As a fellow film fan put it: ""Batman Begins"" is like eating dry toast with nothing to wash it down."" But what is the problem here? Surely this is the film, according to critical and fan response, that has brought Batman into the light? Well, sort of: only in the literal sense of taking him out of the shadows and placing him where he does not belong. Nolan has crafted a picture that works against the inherent absurdity and twisted elegance of Batman. Like scaling Mount Everest with one's nose instead of one's feet, he has attempted performing the impossible and only proved that it cannot be done. Many people have cheered a naked emperor and his picture. It is a picture that embodies the faceless studio system that spawned it and aggressively sells itself as vapid entertainment disguised as ""art"".A good comic adaptation needs a good protagonist. In ""Begins"", which seems only natural, it doesn't get one. Bale physically looks the part as Bruce and even brings some reckless charm to the part - but he's ultimately too bland and joyless. Even worse is his Batman: a sinister, angry, uninhibited creature who blunders and blusters his way through the film's second half. Keaton may have looked less imposing and suave as Bruce Wayne -- but his eyes did acting aplenty. Keaton, like Christopher Reeve as Superman, knew that understatement was the key to suggesting immense intelligence and grace. But Bale's Bruce lurks as a non-entity and his Batman is ultimately overplayed (that gritty voice, some pained imitation of Alec Baldwin or Clint Eastwood, takes the cake).Not even the presence of other heavyweights saves this film. In fact, in many ways, it works against it. What is the collective might of Liam Neeson, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman doing in the same picture? This is Hollywood product. Of the three, it's Caine that fares the best: he brings real authority and palpable humanity to butler Alfred. Neeson, however, delivers a villain as lifeless and flat as Morgan is cool and collected (I don't see Lucius Fox -- I see Morgan Freeman playing Lucius Fox). Katie Holmes, Rutger Hauer, Cillian Murphy and Gary Oldman are the best picks here: smaller names with real talent that work to the film's advantage. But it's not enough. Not a single person gets under the skin of their characters and actually does something memorable.It's not that Nolan hasn't tried. There are some inspired touches. Several early scenes between Bruce and Rachel, when Bruce is a foolish young man with a gun in his pocket and a chip on his shoulder, hit their mark; several later scenes between Bruce and Alfred are also infused with genuine warmth and emotion. Nolan also concocts some clever visual pieces - young Bruce watching stage performers morph into bats, the Scarecrow's vile hallucinations - that suggest a depth and power otherwise muddied or missing. The early cinematography, where the bleak Asian mountains are used to represent Bruce's cold psyche, is incredibly effective. There's even a moving line here and there: ""Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up"".Batman is a dark hero - but his cinematic outings should inspire. The other big pictures of 2005, ""Revenge of the Sith"", ""Sin City"" and ""King Kong"", are rich in style and substance. Begins just flaps about in its own excrement. In attempting to be so literal, it forgets how to be abstract and entertaining. Bruce's training is a prime offender. Why, in six films, did George Lucas not once show any of the Jedi training to fight or construct their lightsabres? Because it wasn't necessary! Ra's Al Ghul repeatedly attacks Bruce and rattles off hollow soundbites like: ""Training is nothing. Will is everything"". All well and good - but Yoda said a similar thing in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and then put his words into action. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" didn't just tell, it showed, and in lifting the X-Wing out of the swamp, Yoda taught Luke and the audience more than they thought possible. Such awe and wonder are alien to this film. Hollow sentiments like, ""It's not who you are underneath, but what you do that defines you,"" again spelling things out, just rub salt into the wound.The film's narrative wants to be epic and serious - but it undermines itself at every turn. Bats don't attack people. People don't fall hundreds of feet and live to tell the tale. The technology that Bruce wields wouldn't have gone unused. Bruce refuses to kill a prisoner but then blows up an entire gathering (complete with said prisoner) and later leaves the villain to die. In fact, Ra's Al Ghul has no believable motivation for wanting to destroy Gotham (his explanation is downright laughable). The climax then plays out like ""xXx"" or the poorest of the James Bond features. People who crave good film-making are advised to look elsewhere. As if the other problems weren't enough, the horrific editing and tepid scoring kill the flow and scale of the film dead. But that was never going to be difficult. Even the woefully excessive ""Batman and Robin"", the previous nadir of the series, wasn't shackled in pretense. Nolan definitely danced with the devil in the pale moonlight. This isn't art or entertainment - it's mutilation."
217,"This has to be one of the more disappointing movies I've seen in a while. With such a top-notch cast of talent with names such as Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, and especially Gary Oldman, one could be expecting to see a high-quality piece of cinematic entertainment.Unfortunately, this was far from the case.I used to be an avid comic book collector in my youth, and while Batman was never one of my favorites, I looked past that and put that past to keep an open mind and let the movie speak for itself. It really was not well-spoken.The plot, while unlikely, is totally non-cohesive and one finds themselves constantly laughing throughout and the nonsense they are watching. The characters are weakly written (especially Gary Oldman's pathetically boring 'Good-guy' cop) and the screenplay could have been conceived of by a 12 year-old C grade student. I only watched this because it was on sale after Thanksgiving for $4.88 on DVD and I can honestly say it wasn't even worth that.If you are really in the mood for a good comic book movie, watch the first X-Men movie. You will be far less disappointed."
218,"This film is severely under par and overrated! Nolan's directing should have propelled this adventure to the cosmos, but just like the character himself, it falls flat on its face. Nolan is no action director, and it shows! Too choppy and too damn close. You need a second set of eyes to see what the hell is actually happening during the action. The music, or rather lack thereof, was horrendous. Warner Bros. hired Zimmer and Howard to compose an orchestral masterpiece, and all that was made by these two men was a two-note fanfare!? How disappointing! The bat mobile chase, the training montage, and the ""climactic"" train sequence were so cliché. Didn't we already see this in a certain web-slinger's movie. I read that Nolan used about half of the budget on the car and train chases. Where did it all go?! The tumbler chase is just loud and uneventful. The ""monorail"" has three layers of train tracks, and only ONE car on ONE track was used. What potential the climax had! What a let down! The villains were stupid, but well acted. Cillian was neat, but his Scarecrow needed more than 1 minute of screen time to make an impact on the psyche. For sure there will be a sequel, but ""Begins"" has nothing on ""Memento,"" ""Insomnia,"" and ""Following."" Does ""sucks"" have three or four U's? Happy Viewing, If you can."
219,"Well...this is just another bad action movie based on a comic book -that has nothing to do with the original book. First of all ,the movie has changed the entire character of Bruce Wayne -he's not an arrogant one like Christian Slater's acting ;he's more like a quite rich and respected gentleman who's life as a superhero are way different and separated then his life as another everyday person. And besides -the batmobile is just ridiculous in the movie -I mean ,a heavy kind of an armored tank....? what's wrong with you people?...the batmobile is way different in the book ,not mentioning all the unnecessary special effects around the movie and the random sequence of events (bad scrips and bad writing...). In conclusion: dry ,boring ,another pointless remake -too overrated and too hyped."
220,"Batman begins is the beginning of an era of all around bad movies. Bad acting, bad directing and bad writing. Did anyone else notice batman had only one expression, the blank gaze. Except when he was really angry, that warranted a shaking jaw. His low, ""I am Batman"" voice got increasingly gruff throughout the movie, to no benefit whatsoever. His interrogation routine was severely flawed, what with the administration of insanity gas prior to shouting clichéd questions, to a now incoherent being. His defense mechanism was to jump off buildings at any sign of danger, and he couldn't even manage to lift a log of himself, despite the adrenaline that should be coursing through his veins, without the encouragement of Alfred. To top it all off, Batman was just a tool in general, wiping out hordes of innocent people for the sake of petty revenge. I miss the good old days, when superheroes weren't required to let angst affect their every move, driving included. Bring back the Batmobile, that hunk of machinery was a pathetic replacement for some long lost masculinity. All in all, the highlight of the film, and some of the best acting, was the hobo.End rant."
221,"I am a religious Batman fan(sadly, haven't gotten ahold of the comic books yet), but this? This movie, is a pure annoyance.Ra's Al Gul? Could have been played so much better by his right hand man, Liam Neeson. Al Gul is not of any other nationality. If anything, he's British. And I love Cillian Murphy to death, but Doctor Crane is a gangly, red headed maniac. Not a drop dead gorgeous man. Comish G, perfect performance by Gary Oldman.I like how they used not so popular villains in this movie, but thats about it. Storyline is utterly insane. The police force/authorities of Gotham in a ""league of shadows""(another non-popularvillain group of 'Vertigo'...bad mix of villains in my view.) to ""fix"" Gotham? No way. Never.If they rushed this movie to get it out to the ""Crying"" public, they should have waited and saved up money to get people that actually FIT the freaking character. Like Liam Neeson was PERFECT for Ra's Al Gul. PERFECT! When he first appeared in the movie and he said Ra's Al Gul, I was thinking that he was saying he worked for him, but really was him. I mean, come on! The goatee/mustache IS Ra's Al Gul! DID NO ONE ELSE SEE THAT?!?! (but then again you'd have to have seen every 1990's Batman Animation Series episodes over 3 times each ^_^) ...and weirdly, Christian Bale looked a bit...chubby in the Suit. (Honest, no joke. Sorry Bale.) The bottom line is, no one will ever get it right. Jack Nicholson, ruined Joker. I fell in love with the cartoon character and then wanted to burn the VHS of the first Batman because of it! Michael Keaton? Don't get me started. The film industry just DO NOT understand Batman, and never will. They never keep the story straight, or it all in the same book! But they never will make the movies the way they should be, because in their world, it's all about money, and not justice to the story.And yes, it seems they are making a new one. I checked out the man they're talking to for The Joker. And all I can tell is, they want him for his nose. Bad idea, boys.But I will see it when it comes out, only for 2 reasons.The Joker and Harley Quinn. (IF they feature her. My favorite role model in life ^_^)"
222,I went to see this because of the hype just like dark knight and was so disappointed. It was boring just like dark knight and I'm NOT just a troll. Just not a sheep
223,"Having just watched the DVD release of this summer blockbuster, I have little to report in regards to Batman Begins, other than these few words: exceedingly disappointing. After an enthralling and intelligent 40 minute preamble, the story slides into a cookie-cutter WAL-MART stocking-stuffer. What a shame - great cast, interesting setup, beautiful sets, intelligent director - but lousy bloody script! What a shame Hollywood shows only an interest in producing lunch-pail products. The film ends in one's mind before you switch off your television; you know he gets the girl, saves the city and punishes the bad guys . . . and yet, this film is so obvious and predictable, I had to watch it to the end, just to ensure it WAS predictable. Ah well, I've lost all my faith in comic-book to film adaptations. At least Sin City pushed the limits (of good and bad taste). All Batman Begins pushes are a suggested sequel, a Mac Ronald's promo and some Chinese action figures."
224,"I know I'm in the minority, but I found this to be a spectacularly bad film on almost every level. Michael Caine and Liam Neeson, fine actors who often seem to take roles to pay off their credit card debts, turn in the worst performances of their respective careers. Christian Bale turns in a stunning, or rather stunned performance (he seemed to be under the influence of some kind of heavy sedative). Only Morgan Freeman and Katie Holmes gave performances worth mentioning. The first because although he's in another of those ""wise prophet in bad movie roles"" that he seems to specialize in these days, his performance is warm and energetic. His Fox is actually likable -- in a three-dimensional way. Holmes turns in her best performance since Dawson's Creek. It's not saying much, but it's something.The plot and the characters is beyond unbelievable and, in some ways, downright offensive. Bruce Wayne's father, a billionaire industrialist who also happens to be a physician, who builds a monorail -- a MONORAIL! -- to pull the city out of a depression (but not the national economy? Does the monorail go all the way to Metropolis, too?), and centralizes all transportation and the municipal water supply in his own corporate headquarters is a good guy? Huh? Sounds like a megalomaniacal John D. Rockefeller-meets-Boss-Tweed type, actually.This isn't a minor point, since the father is central to Bruce Wayne's motivation (and his hackneyed Oedipal -- we saw it in Star Wars -- relationship with Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul). What the film is saying is that, without the intervention of corporate capital (Wayne Enterprises), the body politics will collapse in on itself; that the corporation -- Halliburton, maybe? -- will save the nation where civil society has failed. Make no mistake, Bruce Wayne is NOT a lone vigilante; he is the enforcement arm of the trillion dollar corporation he runs and which arms him. Given the state of things today, I find that disturbing.The plot is so full of inconsistencies, that I wouldn't know where to start. The one that leaped out at me and had me shaking my head the most, though, was the idea that the best way to stop the microwave weapon from blowing up the central water system was to send it sailing into the central water system. I'm no physicist, but wouldn't the pressure built up from the vaporized water leading INTO the central system cause it to blow? Wouldn't it be possible to blow the whole thing up just by getting close? There's not much to be said for this film. The long shots of Gotham City looked like the backdrops of a mid-90s video game. The on-site sets looked like they were trying to do Tim Burton without actually having the faintest idea how. I know Gotham is a declining megalopolis, but why does the WHOLE city look like a slum -- except for Wayne Manor, which seems to be in the foothills of the Scottish Highlands with nary a road nor a telephone pole, nor a building to be seen up to the horizon.I understand that superhero films require a suspension of disbelief. That, in fact, is part of their appeal. This one asks the viewer to suspend far too much. At the same time, it asks you to swallow an ideological message that only George W. Bush could love. That's just way too much."
225,"quote. When I heard they were making another Batman movie that explored the origins of Batman with promises of a much better conceived portrayal of the dark knight, I was very excited. Then, when I heard that Christian Bale who's famous for his dark and sinister characters in ""American Psycho"" and ""The Machinist"", was going to play Batman, I got even more excited. Then, the announcement that Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" fame was picked to direct it, and I was almost certain this film was to not only be the best Batman movie in the franchise, but the best film of the year! Then I saw it.Needless to say, I was a little disappointed. The movies seemed to fall flat in a number of places. For starters, let's begin with direction. With Christopher Nolan in the drivers seat, I kind of expected a tight, clever plot with a less formulaic film style then what was presented. Sure, I mean Nolan had to stick with the script that was given to him and not tamper with the story of Batman. But I felt that the story could have been better displayed. The action scenes in the movie were too quick and flashy, leaving the characters on the screen virtually indistinguishable from one another. What I took away from the film was that it was loud and there were a lot of flashy action sequences where apparently something happened. The film seems to move too quick in some areas and too slow in others. I mean, was the entire process of becoming Batman completely necessary. At least the previous films left some sense of mystery of who Bruce Wayne was and where he got his bat gadgets. I mean, who really cares when it comes down to it? It took away from the plot of Batman Begins.Let's talk about the acting - subpar at best. Hollywood actors should have to have licences to act then Katie Holmes should have hers revoked for her role as a Assistant DA. She was about as convincing as an attorney as Denise Richards was as a nuclear scientist in that stupid James Bond movie. She was supposed to play Bruce Wayne's (Bale) love interest but the on screen chemistry between the two is laughable. Bale's acting was OK, but not like anything we've seen him do in the past. I think if he portrayed Bruce Wayne more like his psychologically tormented character Trevor Reznik in ""The Machinist"", we would have had a better movie on our hands.All in all, this movie wasn't anything special. It was your typical Hollywood formula, good guy versus bad guy, special effects extravaganza with no real value at all.A very forgettable film with bad acting, unnecessary scenes, poor direction and a penchant for overkilling the point. Yes, we understand Bruce Wayne doesn't like bats, and he has to overcome his fear and bring justice to the city of Gotham and yadayada.....blahhhhhhhhh! This oversimplified account of the story of Batman should have been given a different title - ""Batman for dummies and for people that like things that go vrooom and boooooom!"" In its defense, however, it was better than that god awful ""Batman and Robin"". If you really want to watch a good Batman movie, watch the first one. end of quote. the best it can get is 5. I voted 1 just to try to make the result balanced a bit."
226,"Wow, can you say ""boring"" any louder? I am a Batman fan, but this movie was just ridiculously boring. i mean seriously, it actually starts out with a little boy stealing a small rock from a little girl, and then he falls down a hole. talk about your exciting film openings. ah well, anyways, years later, he is Bruce Wayne, the only white man in an English-language Chinese prison. Bruce is pretty rich back in America, but he had himself sent to a Chinese prison so that he could train himself to beat people up, because he's peaved about his parents getting shot by a lame mugger. Okay. Then, he meets a guy with some sort of unpronounceable name, and this guy wants Bruce to join his group of evil ninjas. So, Bruce is like, ""Evil ninjas? Where do I sign up?"" Of course, when the evil ninja training is finished (wich totally sucked) and they want him to kill somebody, Bruce freaks out and burns down the whole place, probably killing quite a few people, very not Batman like since he vowed not to ""kill"" anyone(though Michael Keaton's wasn't a complete wimp like bale is here). Okay. Then, he goes home to rejoin the business world and fight crime. Luckily, he meets a guy at his father's company, and this guy makes superhero equipment for a living. Talk about your happy coincidences.David Goyer must be stopped. Seriously. I have no idea how anybody could have looked at the script for this ****ing abomination and said, ""Hey, I want to make that!"" How many lame-brained action movie clichés can you fit into one film? How much cringe-worthy cheesy dialog can you make your overqualified cast choke out? How much cheesy sentimental bullshit can you squeeze into a movie about a guy fighting crime in a modified s&m outfit? If you're David Goyer, the possibilities are endless.I cannot believe the ratings this film has received. It is a good example of what happened in ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". Long story short, two con men convince everyone that they've made luxury clothes for a king when in reality, they have made nothing. According to them, only those worthy enough can see the clothes. Everyone fakes that they can see them, including a very naked king, so that they can feel worthy.My God, this fable fits ""Batman Begins"" perfectly. It is an overblown, poorly written, stiffly acted, and badly photographed film. The action is completely ""been there done that"" and is photographed WAY too up close, like many bad action movies of late. Christian Bale has a monotone voice and has NO EXPRESSION! Not ever. He frankly looks bored most of the time. That really bugged me. And yes, his voice as Batman was just plain embarrassing. It felt like an SNL skit of Batman.I truly think that the marketing of this film was solely based on the idea that ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"" sucked. They weren't good, but lets remember, they each made a good amount of money for so films so critically drubbed. But they made money because people were entertained, even if they are too chicken to admit it. But Nolan gets to show us that they were stupid and frivolous movies and that he's going to blow them out of the water by being adult and intelligent. Audiences don't want to feel stupid, they LIKE feeling smart, thus with open arms people have accepted ""Batman Begins"" because they are told it is dark and unlike any other. But people truly are making more of ""Batman Begins"" than it is.It strives so hard to be realistic and profound that it strips the energy and excitement form Batman. People talk in heavy handed riddles and the dialog is leaden and pretentious. And the plot is at times damn confusing. Characters appear and disappear, only to change motivations or create new motivations altogether. Blue flowers and weird organizations come about hoping the audience can fill in an explanation, and some Asian guy...has seemingly no purpose whatsoever, but appears in the film long enough so that one thinks hes there for a reason. Also, the montage of Batman training was very scatter shot. What did they show? Really...I think they just quickly edited a few hundred frames of nothing. The Pre-batman stuff, you know, the ""Begins"" part of the film, wasn't very strong at all.In the end, I didn't care for anyone, because no one was developed! You can talk about fear all you want, but fear is not a character trait, nor is revenge, and Bruce had seemingly no character beyond this. Maybe its Bale's fault, as he was stiff as a corpse, but Bruce never felt real.This is so far a very harsh review, so why would I even give the film a 4/10, when thus far it seems closer to a 2/10 from my perspective? Out of respect to Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkonson. By casting respected, award-winning actors in small parts, some which are truly perfunctory, each man is only given a few moments to strut their stuff. I cherished those moments because even in a bad movie, these guys can act. But really, Gary Oldman in a small role as a humble cop who - basically does nothing?? Come on! Overall though, this is a huge letdown. People cite the darkness, and the depth of the characters, but the film is as deep as cardboard. You need not look farther than Bruce's relationship to Katie Holmes' character to see that this film is truly just a shallow hackneyed popcorn movie with a serious identity crisis, and really good marketing. If you want to see a REAL Batman movie that is not boring and actually takes risks and is original, see the aforementioned first 2 batman films BATMAN and Batman Returns. Thank you for reading."
227,"Whether you like this version of Batman or not ultimately depends on how faithful you are to the classics. I am a huge fan of Batman the Animated series created by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini, as well as Tim Burton's Gothic interpretations, not to mention the Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.Batman to me has always been a tale of how good people fall into sin and how everyone has a dark side. The star of the show isn't Batman himself, but the supporting cast of villains, each committing acts of crime out of revenge or redemption. All of them had a heart and were once human, now trapped in a shell of a monster. The profound thing about it all, was that Batman himself was just as insane as the people he brought in, only he believed he was fighting on the right side of the law. You get none that here. All villains commit random acts of terror, determined to destroy Gotham because they think its a cesspool.But I think the thing that bugged me the most was how they fundamentally changed Bruce Wayne's character in this movie. In the animated series, he is indeed portrayed as tortured soul but he also comes across as being a highly intelligent and sophisticated man. He was able to take down guys like Superman in Dark Night Returns, simply because he was able to outsmart him and was very resourceful. A key point that they missed in this movie was the inner struggle Bruce Wayne has to want to give it all up and settle down with someone he loves. One of my favorite moments for example, is in Mask of the Phantasam where Bruce Wayne is at his parents grave in a thunder storm, begging them to release him of his vow. He is in love with Andrea and wants to spend the rest of his life with her. He cries and begs for a sign, in which Andrea then shows up and two begin crying in each others arms. Bruce was actually happy. It wasn't until Andrea left him that he accepted his fate as Batman. This Batman has none of the human qualities from above. He can't laugh at himself and is full of pure anger and rage. He's almost like Spawn. In fact, the parallels are dead similar with him scaring the crap out of his villains before taking them down. Spawn of course is cooler given that he actually gives the bad guys what they deserve by decapitating them limb by limb.Okay, so let's not compare animation and comics, let's just focus on the film instead. Does it surpass in Tim Burton's movies? Hell no. Sure, Tim Burton didn't have all of the special effects technology that we have today but his twisted imagination allowed him to create a world that was totally Gothic and true to me. I liked the idea of smiling clowns blowing fire from their mouths and monkeys armed with machine guns. The Batman of the past was actually fun to watch as he'd stuff the fiery baton down the jesters throat and pick up two mimes and knock them out by bashing their heads together. It was always the cutest of things doing the evilest of deeds, like the marching penguins in Batman Returns.Burton was also faithful to the love interests of Bruce Wayne as well. It was always set up like a Greek tragedy with the love of his life being the villain he tried to stop. I also like the old Batman costume, the old batmobile and the old batwing. Michael Keaton also played a much better Batman than Christian Bale in that he always looked cool and in control. In this movie, Bale sounds like he has a frog stuck in his throat whenever he tries to speak and the mask he wears makes his head look a bit too big.But I think the crushing blow came at the end, when they tried to reintroduce the Joker. I loved Tim Burton's version because the Joker's whole purpose in that movie was to harass Batman, being that he killed his parents and was the one villain who could outsmart him. I hated how they changed that because Batman in reality is just as responsible for putting villains in his own life as they are for fueling his drive for vengeance.Overall, I have to say that this movie was bad. The fights scenes made no sense whatsoever and were put together by a bunch of stunt men, made up of 60 different takes. It totally blew up everything I came to love and respect about the dark knight and lacked the emotion and humanity of the original series. We didn't need another movie explaining his past, Mask of the Phantasam did a much better job with a lower budget too.I understand that they want to remake Batman for the new generation of fans but if this is the best they can do, then I'm hopping of this train right now. In the meantime, I'll just stick to the classics to remember Batman in his glory days."
228,"I can see that I am in a distinct minority here, but I really found this movie quite hard to sit through. I can also understand why people loved it...it looks great, the cast is top rate, and the direction is stylish and serious. It is also such a huge improvement on the cheesy nonsense of some of the previous movies. So where did it all go wrong for me? I was right there at the start, I loved the scenes of Bruce's fall and recovery, and I was really engaged when Morgan Freeman was getting out the Bat-based goodies. It really fell apart for me when the plot veered off into stuff about an unidentified bad guy (obviously Liam Neeson's 'sensei' character) plotting to stick some hallucinogenic gas into the air with the aim of destroying the city because the city is bad. Somehow it just became convoluted, but without the necessary tension to keep me interested. By the end it was a matter of supreme indifference to me if Batman lived or died.Such a shame, and hence the harsh rating, but I am very hopeful that the next movie will sharpen up the plot a long way, but retain the excellent style of this movie."
229,"Where to begin? Unbelievably ill-conceived. That's it. A film that tries to be everything to all people, and ends up being nothing as a consequence.An important point to establish up front is that, hysterical claims to the contrary aside, the film is *not* an adaptation of the comic character in any more than the most superficial of ways. The filmmakers simply altered the fundamental elements of the character to far too great a degree. The film, then, must be judged on its merits as a film, not as an adaptation.So how is it as a movie? This one had a lot of potential, and it was hard to watch it fall apart as it went along. Some grumble-inducing moments notwithstanding, it's actually quite good in the early going. It's engaging, well-constructed, and, despite a lot of high-fallutin' monologues about the psychology of fear, never comes across as overly pretentious. The first indication of trouble, however, occurs in this early part of the movie. Bruce Wayne, our future Batman, has been in training with the League of Shadows, a ninja-style group led by Ras al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). Upon his ""graduation,"" Ras explains his master plan. His ""explanation"" is an utterly incoherent rant about ""destroying Gotham,"" Bruce's home city, for no apparent reason other than that it is ""corrupt."" As Watanabe rambled, I started giggling. That the film, in standard Hollywood tell-you-what-you're-supposed-to-think-about-what-you're-seeing fashion, presents this as a very somber, serious moment only added to the joke. Bruce, having listened to this, then turns to Ducard (Liam Neeson), the man who'd recruited him into the League, and asks, totally deadpan, if he really believes in all of this, and my giggles turned into outright laughter, shared by others in the theater. It's an embarrassingly idiotic moment that immediately took me out of the mood that had been established.The film bounces back fairly quickly from this early misstep, though. Back in Gotham, uber-boss Carmine ""The Roman"" Falcone is very well established; he's a guy who runs everything in a corrupt sewer of a city. A scene wherein he threatens to shoot Bruce in a restaurant full of city officials, convincingly explaining that he could do so and get away with it, is certainly a keeper, and promises much more to come. Why the filmmakers bothered spending so much time and energy setting him up is anyone's guess, though, because nothing much ever does. They could have built a movie, or an entire series of movies upon Bruce's efforts to clean up the town, as they'd established it, but, instead, the mighty Falcone is decimated by the Batman in mere minutes, in ludicrously implausible fashion, none of his power helping him a bit. This is to get him quickly out of the way so the movie can radically switch gears, and the new gear it falls into is near-complete idiocy.This gear-switching is so jarring because of the two diametrically opposed--and irreconcilible--directions in which the filmmakers tried to take ""Begins."" The end-product is a cut-and-pasted mess, drawing, almost equally, from great and solidly grounded Batman material, like Frank Miller's ""Batman: Year One"" (which should have been this movie), and very bad, very dated, and embarrassing comic book stuff from yesteryear featuring motiveless, pretentious, overblown, super-villains with some incredibly idiotic (and laughably inefficient) plot to ""destroy"" something. When it kicks into this second phase, every minute of the movie seems to be worse than the one before.The movie essentially disintegrates from the moment Bruce dons the Batman mask. Sitting in the theater, you can almost physically feel the film's IQ drop. Christian Bale, who had done an admirable (if largely unexceptional) Bruce Wayne, never comes close to getting a handle on his characters' alter ego. Indeed, his Batman voice and persona suggest the actor had picked up his direction on how to play the part at the Keanu Reeves School of Acting. When Bruce becomes Batman, all he has to do to rid Gotham of the mighty Falcone is rough up a dozen of his men who are, at that time, in the middle of completing an illegal drug shipment, then attack Falcone and leave him chained and beaten senseless at the scene of the crime. This, we're told, will send Falcone away forever. Uh huh. Then, the filmmakers get to the story they really wanted to tell: Ras al Ghul returns, still looking to ""destroy Gotham"" for no real reason. His means of doing so is the most ludicrous item in a film filled with ludicrous items, and the final hour of the movie is dedicated to a lot of empty standard-issue Hollywood sound and fury, as the plot plays itself out. Unforgivably, the film's last scene is a straight steal of the great ending of Frank Miller's ""Batman: Year One,"" which only serves to rub salt in the wound the film has created by spoiling the scene for some future filmmaker who may one day want to make a real Batman movie.I have no tolerance for this sort of thing anymore. If I hadn't been with a friend, I would probably have left long before it was over In the final analysis, ""Batman Begins"" is inferior, in pretty much every way, to the original Burton flick, and is even less of a Batman movie. For my part, I hope it's going to be ending, rather than beginning, a Batman franchise. I'm rather fond of the character, and have had quite enough of Hollywood dragging him through the mud."
230,"Sorry to upset die-hard Batman comic book fans, but I really hate and detest this movie. It is an insult to the 'Batman' I love and remember from my childhood. The Burton/Schumacher pictures were marvellous fun because they did not take themselves seriously. All I got from this one was a king-size headache and a sore bottom where I was bored senseless for the best part of two hours. Chris Nolan thinks 'Batman' should be taken dead seriously. A rich man who goes out at night in a rubber suit designed to resemble a bat? Oh, come on! Putting the Caped Crusader in a film like this is like making 'Austin Powers' the star of a Daniel Craig-type Bond film. Worse, the chief villain - The Scarecrow ( Cillian Murphy ) - is another nut, only this one runs round with a sack on his head! Michael Caine's 'Alfred' cannot hold a Bat-candle either to Alan Napier or Michael Gough. The story of this film...well, was there one? All I saw was a lot of fighting with nothing in-between. It has been announced that Warner Bros. are rebooting the franchise once more. Good idea. They need to use the Burton/Schumacher movies as a template for any further entries. This one hit the big screen with all the force of a wet lettuce. Ker-flop!"
231,"This new take on Batman just doesn't seem to work quite right. Nolan tries to basically get Shakespearean with the character and completely ignore the first four films. In some ways that works but in other ways it veers off into a Batman universe that makes no sense and becomes basically a movie that seems like he's attempting to have Batman seem more realistic to being like a person in our real universe. This is where Nolan fails. The magic and fun of Batman evaporates quickly. A man dressing up as a bat and fighting crime has a humorous element to it that Nolan completely ignores with this incarnation and everyone in this universe acts really dumb about it and their reactions to it make little sense especially Gordon's character. A lot of what Gordon does lacks logical sense and he never seems to really question the mental state of the person he first sees dressed as a bat. He's portrayed like some idiot willing to eventually put complete trust in someone he knows practically nothing about running around in a bat suit. His reasons for being so trusting are never clear. Does he know something everyone else doesn't? Bale's performance was pretty average but not as compelling as Keaton or Kilmer. He also tries to have a Batman voice that sounds ridiculous. The only reason for this film's critical success is that it struck a cord with the comic book fan die hards. It certainly didn't do that impressive box office numbers. Now with news that Nolan is going to present The Joker in a sequel, I see a potential disaster waiting to happen."
232,"Am I missing something? What is it people saw in this movie to give it such a high rating? It must be Nolan fans and studio plants. This movie was a train wreck from beginning to end from the casting mistakes to the nonsensical plot. As for being more true to the comic books, are the people who believe that on crack? This was a complete departure from not only the previous Batman films but certainly Bob Kane's original intention. There has to be at least a sprinkling of humor for Batman to work and make sense because a man dressing up as a bat does come across as humorous no matter how you cut it. The idea is Bruce Wayne has gone so far into a dark place in his mind that he does go crazy and a man running around as a bat is crazy and a little funny. This film tried to make the notion so serious that it was too serious to be taken literally. And as far as everybody complaining about how in the first Batman Bruce Wayne's parents were killed by The Joker, stop your whining. I laughed at the court room scene where the criminal who killed Bruce Wayne's parents is shot walking out of the court room by a...woman! Then Katie Holmes reaction saying, ""Bruce you don't need to see this."" to Christian Bale muttering, ""I have to see this"". It was beyond ridiculous. All in all forget this film and stick with the first three. It is a complete over-hyped waste of time."
233,This movie was absolutely dreadful. Christian Bale as Batman was just absolutely ridiculous not to mention Michael Caine with his accent. There were several points in the movie I burst out laughing at Bale's delivery of lines. It was like he practically growled as if to sound menacing. I think the public at large just has no idea what is an accurate portrayal of Bob Kane's comic character. To me the closest I think was the original 1989 Batman movie. The absurdity of Batman Begins was how serious it was trying to be which made you laugh at it rather than with it. The Scarecrow was the most disappointing villain of any of the previous Batman films. He was completely boring and just downright stupid. This film was such a complete insult to the fans who have stuck with the movie series through the good sequels and the bad. Unfortunately a new generation of children think this is cooler than a Batman that makes much more sense and has an element of fun to it. Tedious and bland is the only way to describe this new reinvention of the Dark Knight. Next!
234,"Teenagers have a tendency to be terribly self absorbed, boring people, and this is ably demonstrated not only by the teenage Bruce Wayne, but rather the whole movie too. The film centres around Bruce's boring attempt to overcome the pain of seeing his parents killed, his anger and so forth. Being a terribly wealthy kid he can indulge himself in becoming a criminal, and training to become a ninja of some sort so that he can fight crime. Very much like a teenager, he thinks his problems are worse than everyone else's, and his overly emotional response is the only way to deal with it. It's unutterable tosh of course, but to compound the sin, this pathetic self-absorbed garbage is hooked up to a pathetic, self-absorbed storyline. The ninja teacher guy (obviously) wants to destroy Gotham (obviously), and Batman has to save the day (obviously). There some monkeying about with a scientist, and then Batman is having a fight with the bad guy, who dies. Unfortunately, the whining little bat doesn't kop it too. Oh, and Tom Cruise's girl is in it too, but I guess you noticed that already. Anyway, teenagers should get out more and talk to girls, stop thinking that everyone else's life is better than theirs, and carefully avoid role models like this guy!"
235,"A lot of little fanboys rigged the rating for this lackluster sequel. This is no way as good as they want you to think it is. It's a complete joke. There are so many elements of this film that are just all wrong. Christian Bale was basically playing his ""American Psycho"" character in a bat suit. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were brought in as window dressing. Freeman looked like he was slumming it and all in all out of place. All I kept thinking the whole time he was on screen is why is he in a Batman film? Is this really a Batman film? The reality is it's another completely different movie made to appear like Batman. Not much of the plot made a whole lot of sense. And as for Katie Holmes? I was wondering even more aloud why she was in a Batman film. Oh the agony of all. This movie sucked and the fanboys just can't admit to themselves. Overall it was a rethink that was a complete waste of time."
236,"I've come to realize that I've attempted to watch this movie five times, and I've never made it past the first hour and fifteen minutes. I either fall asleep from sheer boredom, or I lose interest and get up. But, as a huge, massive comic book fan boy (Batman tattoos and all), I keep trying to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. But it has yet to win me over even in the slightest... Plus, who can watch Katie Homes in anything?I saw about 20 minutes of the sequel, and wasn't blown away at all. In fact, as soon as Bale put on his 'Batman' voice, my two even bigger comic fan friends, started to laugh so hard in the theater that we were asked to leave. Does anybody really find that voice cool?"
237,"This was the leading film in the summer of unnecessary and instantly forgettable remakes - Herbie, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Bewitched, and I'll stop here before I even get to the wretched horror of The Dukes of Hazzard. And Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are low and they can't make as much money? I realize the fans and critics felt this installment took the legend seriously but sorry comic geeks. A man dressed up as a bat is something that could never be taken completely seriously without a touch of camp. That's why Burton nailed the task of dark with just the right amount of campiness. As for this film, it's neither a sequel or a prequel. Good actors with the exemption of casting mistake, Katie Holmes, good director but other than utterly unnecessary retread of the origin story. Batman has already been reinvented twice and now a third. I will give props to Christian Bale but still not up to par with the likes of Michael Keaton. And Jack Nicholson's performance that was fascinating and brilliant at the same time? That's an impossible act to follow. The villain in this film was neither scary or interesting. Boring and instantly forgettable is more like it. It's no wonder moviegoers are left in such a catatonic state from Hollywood's desperate attempts at creativity. How many times can you reinvent the same franchise? A far more interesting installment should've been BATMAN ENDS."
238,"Number one, when did Alfred become a cockney butler, Michael Cain was terrible his acting made me laugh and want to vomit out my face and I like Michael Cain, he was amazing in Austin Powers gold member and Jaws 4. What else was rubbish, where were the bad guys, some stupid Irish man in a silly mask called the scarecrow, which just made me laugh, how can you compare this to batman and batman returns in beyond my belief.The most important thing wrong with this film was that there was no fantasy, which made batman stand out from the rest of the Hollywood action films.Batman begins is just another Hollywood film cashing in on the popularity of the new craze of comic book films.I think Chris Nolan is a good director, but this was not his genre to touch. He makes realistic films and Batman Begins should have been made more fantasy.Tim Burton where are you?"
239,"ChristopherNolan made a lot of serious mistakes in this film. First, casting Christian Bale who has all the charisma and gravitas of a pumped-up Pauly Shore. But so what? This film is an obvious feeble stab at resurrecting a moribund Batman series that should have gone to a peaceful demise 8 years ago. Katie Holmes? Please. Probably a nice kid, but she'd barely survive a casting call for summer theater in Akron, Ohio. The pretentious, plodding script is lugubrious, morose and utterly incredible--even for a comic book. What is this nonsense about Shangri-La and Ninja gibberish and psychobabble about fear and revenge? Don't even ask about the ludicrously lame scenes of battle and urban catastrophe--pathetic. The editors should be taken out and shot. But wait! No! They had nothing to work with! If you need one simple proof of how rotten this is, just consider the great character actor Gary Oldman embarrassingly mired in this bat dung. I did however love Rutger Hauer as Donald Rumsfeld. Michael Caine should have paid to have his scenes deleted. Morgan Freeman, the default Black eminence in many recent films, phones in his routine performance. Liam Neeson, a superb actor, is again relegated to a murky back-story clichéd role as in Gangs of New York and a couple of later Star Wars pics. One standout in this mess is Cillian Murphy as a preening, smarmy uber-yuppie. Now if HE had played Bruce Wayne and Tim Burton had written and directed and Blanchett or Kidman had been Rachel Dawes and Gary Oldman were Scarecrow, who knows?"
240,"After reading the numerous good reviews of this film, I was expecting a seriously made, deep movie that explored the batman character in a meaningful way. There are so many things wrong with this film, but basically it just quickly degenerates into the typical brain dead Hollywood teen-pleasing crapola. I think all the A list actors were just collecting fat pay checks. I know Bale was probably looking for a blockbuster movie to propel his face a bit more into the mainstream, but he picked a turkey here. I really think Bale is a brilliant actor (as he showed in American Psycho) but he is wasted in this movie.The action sequences suffer from the modern Hollywood 'X-box' editing desease, where no shot stays on screen for more than a split second. This simply confuses the viewer as to exactly what he's supposed to be seeing. The score is good, but pervades far too much throughout the film. The plot is pretty ridiculous.I won't carry on criticising it, but this movie DOES NOT deserve to be anything like #80 in the IMDb list (as it presently is). Is this really a better movie than Midnight Cowboy??!!??!! I think not.Does absolutely NOTHING to restore my nearly extinguished hope that Hollywood is ever going to make brilliant mainstream movies again, like it used to do in the 70s (Godfather, Deer Hunter, Deliverance, etc. etc. etc.)"
241,"So,it's an all new original Batman film? HA! this film can't even get past the opening credits without ""borrowing"" from the other Batfilms! The Warner Brothers Logo morphs ,just like all 4 previous films.What else have we seen before? Batman pulls up criminal by lapels: ""What are you?""""I'm BATMAN!"" Hmm... didn't we see that in BATMAN? Batman standing on pillar among Gotham's skyscrapers as heroic music swells...add a Batsignal behind him...and yep..already done in BATMAN.Batman knows KungFu? See BATMAN & BATMAN RETURNS.Bruce falls through a hole and finds the BatCave... wasn't that in BATMAN FOREVER? Bats frighten Bruce into becoming Batman...also part of BATMAN FOREVER! Batman hands his secret identity over on a silver platter? See all 4 previous BatFilms.(This only worked as a plot point in BATMAN RETURNS!) ""Batman Begins"" wastes about an hour telling you he's a secret KungFu expert. And wastes even more time trying to make Duchard & Ra's Al Ghul the same man.(Why does Liam Neeson claim he's Ghul?). Speaking of Ra's,he should have been of Arabic origins,not a feudal Japanese warlord.Ken Watanabe is a fine actor but Arnold Vosloo would have been THE Ra's Al Ghul.And speaking of Ra's,where is his daughter Talia? She was a MAJOR Batplot character as she was obsessed with Batman! (Would've made a better female lead character!) Why not give us more story by advancing the film,and logging the previous four ""as read""? (i.e.: Batman is a superhero,destroying villainy,knows all sorts of fighting techniques,has cool toys,do not mess with him. Need we know anything more?)If you read the comics,BATMAN became a bat not out of HIS fear,but the fear bats give others. He does not find the cave as a child.(Stupidly drilled into us in two films now.).Much as I love Michael Caine...sorry,Alfred is NOT a Cockney. Gary Oldman looks right as James Gordon,but it's a thankless role.Morgan Freedman is relegated to Alfred#2,as they basically take most of the meat from Lucius Fox's character.(He's a shrewed Wayne Business exec.,not a technological errand boy.).The Scarecrow is reduced to a 2nd class villain,only slightly better than the crummy version they did of BANE! Where is The Scarecrow's scarecrow outfit? (Oh,right...we're trying to look ""cool"").Cillian Murphy makes a cool Dr.Crane,but he isn't given enough screen time! What did the film get right? Well,Joe Chill DID kill the Waynes in the original story. Carmine Falcone is/was the head of Gotham's mafia. Mr.Zsz does carve a notch in himself for every murder he commits. That's about it.And how does this disaster end? By suggesting their next NEW idea:The Joker!(Rumour of Two-Face is also in the works.). Let's erase this film from your memory,and imagine a Batman vs. Scarecrow directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton...we'll forget all about those other three BatFlops."
242,"Ohhh where to begin? I had been hearing so much about this movie. ""Oh it is so much more like the original batman comic books"". ""Finally a serious Batman!"" ""Christian Bale is the best Batman"" Blah blah blah. All three statements couldn't be furthest from the truth. This Batman film was the least like the comic book in so many ways I don't have room to write them all. I just cannot get over how many people are acting like this did something ""better"" or ""more stylish"" than the previous Batman movies. All the movie really did was make a complete departure not only from the universe of the previous Batman films but of the comic book world of the character created in the first place. The visuals were striking but no more striking than Burton's. The actors' performance were OK but Christian Bale as Superman was much the weenie at times and downright boring. Very very little is left the same from all previous representations that all is left is use of character names and places. Is that particularly innovative and creative? Uhhh no I don't think so. The action of the movie if you can really call it that was hardly groundbreaking or anything particularly exciting. Overall very slow moving at times and incomprehensible."
243,"Won't take too much time from this unbelievably enthusiastic crowd to state all the reasons I found this flic so slow and tedious, but have to state quickly that I found the 3 younger actors to be the most lame and wimpiest of any in the Batman series (even though I thought Val Kilmer was a total farce!). Luckily Katie Holmes got a big diamond from Tom Cruise this a.m. at the Eiffel Tower so her future may not be too dependent upon her acting ability. Christian Bale was definitely not believable as having class and polish in his role of a young millionaire. Also, does anyone else think Cillian Murphy would be a good one to cast in a young Bo Derek role? Just throw a long blonde wig on him and he could pass for what she looked like in the mid 80's. (OK, so he'd need a built-up bra and some longer legs!) Thank goodness for popcorn, Morgan Freeman, Ruttger Hauer and Gary Oldman...at least I didn't fall completely asleep."
244,This was by the far the most overrated heap of 2005. It appeals to the A.D.D. X-Box generation. Who cares about Year One. That was just as overrated. This played so much like a video game from beginning to end I didn't feel like I was watching a movie. A lot of action and blowing stuff up for the sake of blowing it up. Bale was horrible as Batman with that ridiculous raspy voice. What the **** was that about? And in this version apparently Batman is also a pedophile. Katie Holmes as his love interest? She looked like she was 14. Guess this is the start of some kind of trend because Kate Bosworth looks like she's a pre-teen and is playing Lois Lane in Superman Returns. Ewww. We definitely all the vacuous kiddies to thank for this slew of super hero movie crappola.
245,"This movie is in the top 80 of best films?? Obviously a bunch of little kids are putting in multiple 10 votes for this film. It was nowhere near the top 80. Katie Holmes was so dreadful I couldn't believe she was in this film. Christian Bale did not make s good Batman either compared to the previous actors who played the character. Let's be honest people. This movie was a joke. There was much about the plot that didn't make sense, the villain, the universe that was previously created by previous Batman movies should not have been ignored and discarded to start over with this mish mash, and what exactly the villains were plotting. It was, as one previous post eloquently put it, in a jumbled ill-conceived mess. But a movie that lots of little kids really liked because it appealed to their short attention spans and small minds."
246,"The movie was completely unrewarding. Some of the plot elements had potential to be interesting, and the concept of the movie was great. Unfortunately, after watching it, I came away completely unsatisfied, because there was nothing more to think about. Everything was portrayed on a 3rd grade level, and nothing was really left to the imagination. where is the dualism of good and evil? Where is the delicate line between vigilante and hero? This movie attempts to draw these lines and then clearly plant itself in the good/hero camp. Yawn. What's the point?I am surprised that this movie is doing so well on IMDb, and hope that people will wake up soon and realize this movie is just another boring action flick. Some say its an improvement from Batman and Robin, notably the worst of the Batman movies. But for what Batman Begins makes up for in plot complexity and special effects, it loses by insulting my intelligence and trying to make everything in the Batman world so black and white."
247,"First let me start off by saying the batman series started and ended with Tim Burton and Michael Keaton. All attempts at the capered crusader have been comical at best. Moving on to the 2hr+ piece of crap known as batman begins, i don't even know where to start ripping this flick -i will list only a few reasons why this movie should never have been made or thrown in the trash instead of releasing upon the public.1. Christian Bale's voice as Batman(tries to deepen his voice) it gets not only annoying but it sounds incredibly forced and dreadful.2. The scarecrow villain is in the movie for literally 1 minute of film time, completely a waste of time because underdeveloped is an understatement.3. The joker is supposed to kill Bruce Wayne's parents when Bruce is younger, not some random poor lowly criminal. Then what should happen is seeking revenge, Bruce turns the murderer of his parents into the Joker. -completely dropped the ball on this one4. Being Batman Begins, Batman can not have a better more updated car than Batman, made in 1989. If its a prequel, make sure everything coincides with the other films - not that hard.5. At the end of the movie - A) Batman gives the bat symbol to gordon - he is not commissioner yet and does not fit with other films b) Jim Gordon shows Batman a joker card, indicating a criminal is out and about on the streets of Gotham- If Bruce Wayne is supposed to in essence create the Joker, how is he around? Doesn't add up at all, leaves more frustration and questions.more things i would have mentioned about this horrendous film - Jim Gordon's character, Bruce Wayne's personality, the batcave, Katie Holmes' character, and a few other small things.All and all just a pile of garbage. The best superhero series as of our time right now is far and away Spiderman. The story is engrossing and extremely well written, and has tremendous casting, unlike Batman Begins."
248,"A lot would argue that ""Batman and Robin"" was the worst Batman movie of the whole series, and that is something I have to agree on. However I feel ""Batman Begins"" is the worst interpretation of Batman ever. I admit I was not too happy with the reinterpretation that occurred with ""Batman Forever"" but that I could live with because there was still a lot of amusing and visual elements to it that made it watchable. ""Batman Begins"" on the other hand is heavy handed and a little too much so to the point that it becomes abysmal and practically unwatchable early on in the first act. I found it becoming tedious with Bale delivering lines like an automaton and even though I think he's a good actor and liked him in other roles, he just wasn't Batman and did not fit the role well enough. As for seasoned actors Freeman, Oldman, and Caine popping in this mish mesh I have no idea what on earth they were thinking. They just made it more grating to bear. Caine has a lot of cred and has been in many superior films but it was actually depressing watching him tread through this sloppy disjointed sludge. He needs to retire. And the less mentioned about the dreadful and miscast Katie Holmes aka Mrs. Cruise the better. I think this was very much catered to the current MTV generation with extremely short attention spans and little imagination. This movie did not amuse or fancy me the way previous Batman films did. In fact it did not entertain me in that way at all, and for that reason I found it to be without value whatsoever. I say why even bother making a Batman film that is so abysmally dull and dim."
249,"i don't see why everyone else thinks this movie is so incredible... i think the movie was awful... there were so many bad parts about the movie that completely ruined it for me:batman's voice was so lame i cracked up laughing in the theatre the first time he spoke - the whole time in the Chinese camp seemed to be a pointless storyline angle and the movie poorly explained his reasoning for even going there in the first place - within minutes, bruce wayne just decided to be batman and had all these ""special"" weapons at his disposal which he immediately went to fight bad guys with - where did the scarecrow get that fire-breathing horse from anyways!?? - if the water vapour machine was activated on the ship out at sea... wouldn't the water around and under the ship be turned into vapour too? - the whole scene with the guys watching the water vapour come towards the central system was, well, bad - the one scene where batman uses a bomb on the door had THE WORST special effects i've seen in a recent movie, i cracked up at this scene too.. it unfortunately ruined all of the other very good special effects of the movieto sum it up, this movie was just great special effects (barring a scene or two) with bad acting and a bad storyline and i definitely do not recommend this movie to anyoneif you do want to see a good ""comic book turned movie"" why not see the x-men or spiderman movies?? those are actually half decent"
250,"'Batman Begins' is a terrific reboot of the Batman franchise. After the disappointing 'Batman and Robin', this is a welcome turn towards gritty reality. The film takes its time explaining to us how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. Special Effects are judiciously used and never overwhelm the story. Bale is good both as Bruce Wayne and as Batman. The supporting cast all shine with only Katie Holmes feeling a trifle miscast. However, the fight scenes are somewhat chaotic and there's a minor lapse into pretentiousness late in the film. Still, very impressive considering this is a superhero movie we are talking about.Overall 8/10"
251,"First of all i am a massive batman fan, batman is love, batman is life. I never heard of Christopher Nolan at first so i was a bit unsure, I remember going with my mother and father to watch this in the cinema, i was praying for a good batman film, as i think we have not had a good decent batman film yet.I remember getting goosebumps straight away with the WARNER BROS. PICTURES and the DC comics intro, The score in the background is the definite batman score in my opinion. I actually have the soundtrack on my phone, sad really.The All star cast in this is perfect, Christian Bale is a wonderful batman, Michael Caine Alfred is spot on, Gary Oldman Jim Gordon is brilliant, really shows how corrupt Gotham City is with his portrayal, I really liked the way young Bruce Wayne was played as well by Gus Lewis, his performance i found very powerful.I think Christopher Nolan got the essence right with this film we see a young Bruce Wayne Struggle With his inner demons, start his training to become the caped crusader, i will always remember Batman's first appearance, They don't see him coming, i think its my favorite scene from the film, brilliantly directed.Short Summary: This is a must see film if your a batman Fan, Batman isn't for just one generation, he's for every generation. ﻿"
252,"I'm guessing they had two movies planned and decided to cram them both in Batman Begins.Granted, there's a lot of back-story written about the infamous Dark Knight so they made two separate movies in this reboot. No complaints here; both stories, I'll name ""Bruce Begins"" and ""Error and Trial,"" were great.""Bruce Begins,"" or the first half, was NOT the movie I was looking forward to, back in 2005 when I was waiting for this to come out. When I watch a superhero movie, I want just that: to see a superhero immediately and throughout to the end, much like what Burton did for the original Batman waaay back in 1989. Well, far be it from me to be proved wrong. Dead wrong.""Bruce Begins"" was exciting, insightful, thoroughly crafted, beautifully shot and gave a lot of the background that I was unaware of in regards to the fall and rise of Billionaire Bruce Wayne (played wonderfully by Bale.) And no, I'm not referring to the background of his parents dying in the alley – DUDE! That's been overplayed so many times, it'll never reach an emotional peak, though that's the motivation within Batman. Nevertheless, the always wonderful Neeson (who played, well, not to spoil it, the ""Mentor"") gave an excellent performance. But, unfortunately, he also leads us to problem #1 in the film.I'm aware the plot all ties in towards the finale, so there really aren't any coincidences, but when the ""secret plan"" is revealed by the mentor, it went from a realistic (as much as any comic book adaptation can be) movie to the level most superhero films fall to. However, it's easy to get past as good as the film is so far.Basically, ""Bruce Begins"" shows the journey of the lost-soul heir who never quite got his fill of justice when his parent's killer was also killed by someone else. He still wants to avenge their untimely and meaningless demise by cleaning up the scum of Gotham City, so he leaves his hometown and scours the Earth to learn both how to fight and what makes the criminal tick, first hand. He's ""rescued"" by his mentor and trained in multiple arts. Unfortunately, for the trainer, the student, Bruce, favors justice over murder.Bruce escapes, while saving his mentor from a fire Bruce helped start, destroying the home base of the mentor, his minions and the evil plans to destroyGotham. There I said it – the silly part. But, not only is that not really a spoiler, but where else would evil-doers travel to? Metropolis? No, this is a Batman movie.Slowly, ""Bruce Begins"" transcends into what I think is the weaker of the two stories: ""Error and Trial."" Weaker is such a negative word here, as the story's second half was nearly excellent, but just not as good as the movie's beginning.Here, we will see Bruce return home, reunite with loved one(s) and don the famous black suit. You'll get it all: the reasons behind each toy, weapon, cape and vehicle you've grown up with in regards to Batman. Of course, there's more: not one but two (or three, or four? It's hard to keep up) villains, but that's just the Batman movie's motto: more opponents arewell, expected.Nicely, though it's a trend in the (then) 5 Batman films, they introduce new (to audiences) baddies: Scarecrow (Murphy) and Ra's Al Ghul. Unfortunately, however, they're not only the weakest of all the movies to date, but the most uninteresting. Still, they're played brilliantly by the actors involved.Each bad man is complimenting the next one in one large scheme in order towell, I don't want to ruin it, but (way unfortunately) along the way there seems to be an extreme lack of Batman's detective skills – wasn't he part of Detective Comics? For the most part, he relied on both his trusty, life-long friend and servant, Alfred (excellently played by Caine) and Fox (also wonderfully acted by Freeman.) This Batman was more brawn and vengeful than the last 4 actors to portray him. Yep, I'm including Quahog Mayor: Adam West.To be honest, this review seemed kind of down. Let me shine a light on this dark knight. This movie was thrilling, had a excellent score – one of my personal all time favorites and matches Elfman's awesome introduction to the caped crusader, brilliantly shot – the cinematography was gorgeous, the plot was intense, the acting phenomenal, contained original action sequences and it certainly set the bar extremely high, literally begging any superhero/comic book movie to challenge the depths of its creativity. And since 2005, though some have been good, only The Dark Knight – this movie's own sequel – topped it.I guess, according to my review of the original Batman, I liked this one less, though that's an apples/oranges comparison. While the original 1989 classic is perfect for what it was – a true comic-book fairy tale, this one's a more grown-up, realistic – for the most part and thoughtful adaptation of a hero that's been around for literally generations. Bypass some dialogue that simply doesn't fit, evil-plots that are borderline silly, the bumps, bruises and blunders of Batman's first outings that are a tad-bit hard to watch and one of my biggest pet peeves – the absolute and thoughtless destruction Batman leaves behind in his GTA road chase, and I will still highly recommend this adventure due to all the greatness that overshadowed its weaknesses. And this is coming from a die-hard Superman fan, so you know I mean it when I say: SEE IT!"
253,"Christopher Nolan did such an amazing job with this film, the presentation of the characters and the visionary setting were just adding to the amazing storyline. This film had to be the best Batman film yet, I cant say I totally enjoyed Christian Bale's ""under the mask performance."" Val Kilmer did a much better job, but that doesn't even pose as a scar to the film. The best part was Nolan's avoidance of CGI animation for the scarecrow, it was realistic. I'm glad Nolan finally made something new after Memento which totally re-defined screen writing as a whole. This film held a very creepy quality that was great for batman. This film was great and was full of great cinematography and the directing, of course, was brilliant. I really hope Nolan continues to keep the same effect he brought to this film."
254,"Evaluating this movie within the context of the action/adventure genre leaves no question as to it's merits or excellence.From the supremely talented collective cast, including my favorite actor Christian Bale, whose turn in Equilibrium and American Psycho left no doubt he would set the standard for all Batman movies, to the thrill a minute last hour, it contained everything summer fare should be...it is a blockbuster that delivers and is every bit the contemporary to the ""Raider's of The Lost Ark"", an iconic action movie.I really think that the dissection of this movie by cinema buffs is overly analytical as it's faithfulness to the action drama and superb acting are the parameters which matter, not how tight the fight sequences were shot or the casting Of Katie Holmes, which parenthetically was not as bad as this board led me to believe.My all-time standard for miscasting is Sofia Coppola in ""Godfather III"" who brought the film to a halt every time she was on the screen; sure Holmes is young, but she was appealing.All in all, this is a solid 10 star movie that leaves you anticipating the sequels."
255,"I remember watching this movie with my dad, and back then it looked just like any other super hero movie, but re-watching it now, I actually like it more then I used to. I like how Bruce Wayne used his fear as a symbol to strike fear into others, and I love how he was trained by ninjas. His relationship with Rachel is not great in the beginning of the film which I also liked, because in most super hero movies the relations are almost to perfect, with them only splitting up because the hero is spending to much time as a hero, or their heroic deeds are most of the time almost getting the hero killed, upsetting the girlfriend. This movie doesn't have that, Bruce and Rachel weren't getting along because Bruce acknowledged that he was a bad person and about to kill a man (who, granted, killed his parents) which upsets Rachel, because you know you don't want your boyfriend/love interest to kill someone regardless of what that person did. And of course I loved Alfred, he's kind of like those video game tips that appear at random when your stuck somewhere, only he doesn't appear at random. There was one thing that confused me though, one League of Shadows member at the end looked a lot like Ra's Al-Gul but didn't he die? I doubt he survived a flaming wooden plank falling on top of him and an explosion, I don't care how good of a ninja he is, he wouldn't survive that! And then I get to a part I found bad which was the scene where Scarecrow gets defeated. He fills Gotham city up with his gas, and comes out with his mask on riding a horse back looking like Jack Skellington and scares the ever living crap out of a child who's under the influence of the gas. You'd think that in this situation he'd be very powerful and hard to defeat, but NOPE! He gets an electric shock to the chest one single time, and rides his horse out of that situation and the movie. That was so bad it was actually funny. I know he's just a normal human but come on, especially considering that he's completely fine in the next movie."

257,"What Deep Impact (1998) was to Armageddon (1998). Although both movies were entertaining Deep Impact's storyline and character's were more well developed. In the end, you actually cared about and for the main characters. Batman (2005)is almost two different movies in one with the visual narrative of Bruce Wayne's history and why he became Batman. Also explained is how he became Batman, and the explanation borders plausibility (as much as a DC Comic movie can). The atmosphere was just right as was the casting, and story development excellent with surprises, plot twists and turns that keep you wondering what will happen next, this is a movie definitely worth checking out."
258,"If you have scrolled through my reviews you will find that Batman Returns is my all time favorite comic book film. So naturally I was a bit concerned when I found out they were starting from scratch. It's somewhat of a good thing though considering the travesty that was 'Batman and Robin'.So we start afresh and the new look is a lot more realistic and all. I don't think it's anti-comic bookish, but it certainly isn't as fantastic looking as Tim Burton's films. Gone is most of the Gothic feel that I loved so much from the first two films and any of the comics I have read.And while I totally understand that Batman is central character in the film and they didn't want to focus too much time on the villains, I did feel the villains were under used quite a bit. I especially wanted to see Scarecrow a lot more in full form. Just when he comes out on that fantastic looking horse he's zapped by a girl and runs away like a sissy. When you have villains in a film, they need to feel more threatening. They should be foes that are somewhat formidable to the hero.I think the key is to look at this as solely a Batman film with only a sample of villainous things to come. This is his origin story. But alas, I can't help but feel a wee bit of disappointment.The music by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is pretty darn good and I can't wait to buy the score. However, there wasn't really any notable theme I could think of. This is a bit disappointing when you compare it to Danny Elfman's sweeping scores.The best action sequences in the film are the Batmobile chase and the scenes where Batman is swooping over the streets when the gas is being leaked into Gotham. I liked the effects they used to get him to look very foreboding. The acting and the casting decisions were great. Michael Caine as Alfred is especially terrific.I think this film tells the story of Bruce Wayne quite well. While not nearly as exciting as I wanted it to be, it's a pretty dramatic film and I enjoyed it on that level.The ending when Gordon pulls out The Joker's calling card gave me chills and hope for better things to come. I'll be there opening day."
259,"I like the sociological commentary it has the same goals that the protag and the antagonist have but have different moral standards and methods of getting there. The movie opens with it's first Act having temporal displacement, to hold our interest and at times to delay exposition, answers to questions like why did Wayne end up in prison. What are the things that have kept his disturbed. From here, we also learn of the philanthropy and good will of his parents and his childhood fear of bats. When the movie clocks 45 minutes, after an immersion of rigid training with the League of Shadows, Wayne manages not to flinch and remain steely calm amongst a cyclone of bats inside a cave.Cillian Murphy - you wouldn't know he was the hapless and the hunted in 28 DAYS LATER when you see his effective villaneous performance in here. The theme of FEAR, is very well played-out. How Bruce Wayne uses his own weakness to make him stronger and to make his enemies share his dread. And you can see the symmetry between scenes, what Rachel tells Bruce in the hotel and what Batman throws back at her when she asks for his name. The compound in the blue flower, the hyperbole of it's effects displayed by the Scarecrowe and the ecoterrorism that stems from the mad doctor's medicine. Or how the TRAIN also becomes a character in the film at one point.Nolan is also a master at creating surrealistic nightmarish sequences, juxtapousition and quick flashes, we've seen him do this in Memento and even more in Insomnia where we become as restless as Al Pacino's character. From the side-effects of the blue flower to what happens when the good guys get poisoned by psychotropic hallucinogen.Batman Begins explores moral standards as well, from philanthropy to how our hero applies what he has learned in a monastery of Ninja Warriors to shake people out of apathy. There is no obvious contrivance of plot devices as the narrative is decisive and taut. The twist behind who or what group of people were really responsible for the depression in Gotham city that has caused many to hunger and turn into a criminal. One thing that Wayne tries to turn into at the beginning of the film and how he reveals how he lost many assumptions of what is ""right and wrong"".You will also see excellent location photography (like Nolan has given us in INSOMNIA), dark and eery sequences with a touch of film noir (we know Nolan is a master of this genre) in them especially with Jonathan Crane, the fear mongrelling Scarecrow who manages to bring down our hero and his District Attorney Lady friend for a time. And eventually, drives the mind of Gotham's toughest most feared criminal boss in for a reversal after the Batman puts him behind bars.Bale brings much duality to the character. Compared to Keaton who was also very good, Keaton was all about subtleties, but Bale brings an arrogance and caustic wit to the character of Bruce Wayne who immediately dons the persona of a beast when he wears the ""costume"". Many might NOT easily grow into appreciating how Bale approaches the role, but his skill because of previous experience in heavy drama as a child actor is put to good use here. Michael Caine, unlike Gough in the quad franchise is more than just a senior citizen lackey but also much like a guide and sort of a father-figure for Bruce. Alfred in here constantly reminds Wayne of his NAME and what might have been left of his father's legacy.And it boasts an all-star cast who all do very good. Morgan Freeman is entertaining as he is a much, older, wiser aid to Bruce Wayne and Batman. ""Didn't you get the memo?"" The contentiousness of Rutger Hauer. And Neeson the movie's master antagonist is imposing as Ducard, Bruce Wayne's trainer in his techniques of subterfuge and warrior arts. Refershing to see Gary Oldman do an EXCELLENT job as the honest and noble Sgt. James Gordon amongst a crooked police department (someone who might be eventually Commisoner in the sequels).The score isn't the like the stylized Gothic timbre and melody that the duo of Tim Burton films had, but the collaboration of James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer coudln't have been a better marriage. From propulsive motifs to hints of histrionic texture as we mostly get from Newton Howard who scored ""Prince of Tides"" and the last 4 M. Night Shyamalan movies. Zimmer has his signature in the score and the propellant energy of his music further accentuates the action scenes.Begins has finally vindicated the name of the Dark Knight after the failures of the last two in the earlier ""Batman quad"". And it is something (not just for fanatics of the DC comic) for those who love to watch an action or thriller movie with a good plot and some things that might be worth thinking about. While a rude awakening for some, the film stresses practicality and contains a verisimilitude not-so expected in movies of this genre. A very good character drama, disguised as an action-thriller. Kudos to Goyer, Nolan and his cast and crew.10/10"
260,"*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERSThe studio and the filmmakers have given us all the things that make Batman such a God among comic book characters.Bruce Wayne has psychological problems. His parents were murdered right in front of him. In Burton's film this was handled with intensity as well, but Nolan made it even more important. The sheer drama of the scene elevates the story arc. The death of Thomas and Martha is what makes Batman Batman. In Frank Miller's YEAR ONE (part one) he put Bruce on his knees between his slain parents on the cover. (An overhead drawing-powerful, succinct)Nolan knows how important this is to the character.Bruce's psyche is so shook up by this early tragedy that he has no desire to do anything but instill fear into the types of criminals that shot his folks.Like The Punisher, everything he cared about was ripped away. Like The Punisher, he is mistaken for a vigilante (even the crooks say he's a loose cannon) Like The Punisher, he PUNISHES. With prejudice. With righteousness, with sweet justification.I've talked to a few people who didn't like the movie. When I ask why I get different reasons: ""My expectations were too high"", ""Liam Neeson is all of a sudden a bad guy? How could he not foresee Bruce refusing to be an executioner?"", ""The bat-suit still sucks"", etc. etc.My expectations were high as well but Nolan surpassed them. The scene when Batman's cowl ""melts"" into a macabre halloween mask and he rages at the perp...that scene alone makes the film the best Batman film ever. That was a scene that was aimed directly at fans of the character. when I saw the cowl melt I clenched my fists and said ""----in' A"" in my head. Instilling fear into criminals is driven home with that little scene. Bale's husky whisper cannot be understated-it's vitally important for Batman to be stealthy, and the voice is just as important as the footsteps.Poetry. Cinematic poetry.Michael Caine embodies Alfred the way he should be, and he steals the limelight from Michael Gough (who I think is the best Alfred), and the humour is very welcome. Alfred is the only person in Batman's life who has his complete trust and respect. You treat Alfred as a joke, a sidekick, and you are committing heresy. In the comics Alfred is extremely vital to Batman's cause, and he even became a costumed hero who died (1966) called ""THE OUTSIDER"". People gotta realize Alfred is just as important to Bruce Wayne as Watson is to Holmes.Gary Oldman is the secret weapon. This James Gordon is the James Gordon comics fans know and love. This is the Gordon of ""Hush"", the Gordon of ""No Man's Land"", the Gordon of ""The Dark Knight Returns"". Oldman should never stop playing ""the Commish"".Katie Holmes is forgettable, and I'm so glad Warner Bros. dropped her for the sequel. What's distressing though is that Nolan may not direct the sequel. Film-making is a long process- remember when Michael Herr talked to Kubrick about the shoot of ""Apocalypse Now""? Herr:""That was a tough shoot, Stanley"". Kubrick: ""They're ALL tough, Michael"".Cillian Murphy is incredible as Scarecrow/Dr. J. Crane. He's got that Harry Osborn thing going on, but Nolan directs him in a way that gives great power and depth and meaning to his scenes. Dude's psychotic! As in the comics. Amen on the treatment of the characters. Blessed be we...Ken Watanabe attempts and succeeds at evoking Toshiro Mifune in a Kurosawa film. His *brief* scenes have weight. More WATANABE!The editing of the film must be singled out as a major reason why the movie works. Lightning fast edits (As Oliver Stone said: ""the audience thinks fast"")allow us to digest the controlled fury of Batman's M.O. The fights are usually blurs, shadows of pastiche, clouds of war. Batman waits, stalks, unleashes. He is the Dark Knight, surrounded by darkness. Darkness that made him who he is. He's a psychologically wounded warrior (nee soldier), and whether or not we agree with his forms of ""justice"" we understand why he does it.Nolan and co. have nailed Batman cinematic ally. Just like Miller & Rodriguez nailed ""SIN CITY"" cinematic ally.We should be grateful films of this calibre are still being made. Christian Bale is Batman. He's the first actor to embody and emote that characters' very real and very complex life.This isn't a ""Biff Bam"" or a ""chicks like the car"" Batman movie.It's the beginning of a legend."
261,"This seems more important in retrospect as the start of a modern saga that aspires to go beyond competently engineered thrills. At the time, the introduction of mature logic and what seemed like 'real world' dimensions in this niche was something new, and fresh after Schumacher's ice-capades. So, because it was conceived as something grounded on the same world and life as ours, I will focus in this comment on that set of dynamics.Everything is rested and elaborated from a basic notion of theatricality and deception as diversions from the real thing. This can be said to be the essence of the real world of adults, primarily so far as politics and economy is concerned (both central tenets in the film). The way it goes, is that you are supplied with a narrative of convenient truths in (more or less) absolute terms of good and evil that obscures the actual dynamics that move the world. And since the time it was made, we have felt our own Depression, still are, and the fabricated narrative that toys with the lives of millions.But the real thing here is a story about a boy.The Nolans are primarily writers, so you can trust that at least what concerns simple storytelling has been mulled over and methodically sculpted in collaboration. You could take Batman out of it, and it's not a bad story by any means. You can imagine, if you will, that the story begins with the death of the parents, and the timeline is jumbled so that the guilt-wracked boy in his mind can make himself out to be responsible; if only he hadn't been afraid at the opera and wanted to go home. At any rate, that boy has suffered a terrible loss and has to find ways to cope with new and dangerous dimensions it has opened in him.That is rendered as a breathless fall into a rabbit hole that unleashes private demons (visualized again a bit later on a stage as indirectly causing the loss). That fall quite literally creates the batman-universe, and that universe is Jungian in the most simple terms, so suddenly around him spring mentors, ogres, the whole shadowy cosmos of juvenile imagination. In that universe he has every means at his disposal to be someone else. He has to have a quest now that allows him to play-act the trauma, one that expressly transforms and liberates blocked energies in the soul.Exactly how he's going to do that is something he learns in the Himalayas, because that's where mystical knowledge resides dontcha know: he is going to embody the image of childhood fear, he is going to quite literally become the painful memory, but that is going to be only theatricality and deception that diverts attention from the utmost goal, the essence of the thing.Now here's the deal. Nolan's smoke and mirrors including 'important' political allusions to our current state are every bit as daft as Marvel, in spite of the glum coating. They are disposable theatrics, but they were going to be wrapper anyway. And we are beginning to press against the limits of Jung's narrative logic, and it shows here. But it's the essence of the thing what cheapens this.What do I mean? The boy is no ordinary boy. He is, we learn, from a long genealogy of good doing battle against evil, down to his great-great-grandfather in the Civil War and we assume beyond. His parents are everything exemplary and noble about humankind, not a single flaw in sight (and incidentally, filthy rich). That is not just his own memory, it's what everybody else thinks. And both the fact that he is from that lineage and that lineage apparently did nothing wrong to amass a fortune, and the fact that the son can do what he does not because he renounces the riches but because he has them, all these things cannot help but matter in the long run.So we have the same old myth of valiant prince-hero slaying evil in his soul and out in the world, but presented in context of the 'real world', and a real world that is hanging in an even more precarious balance than it was 10 years ago, it seems both extremely conservative and inadequate to cover even basics of contemporary narrative.The antagonists are also actors who theatrically deceive, and one is a pawn of the other. They should have balanced the scales. But, Nolan has hit another narrative dead-end with his Ra's Al Ghul. This is particularly egregious because he's meant to represent a balancing force, and Nolan still thinks in terms of character-based decisions. He gives us a secret society and a masterplan, kiddie stuff.Everything in this film is a character attached to a story (the kid - the parents - the great-great-grandfather - the League of Shadows).There is no real transference to where the film can have its own fabric and energy, its own deceptive machinery. You can read this the ordinary way, and there is no challenge. Nolan is just not a very exciting filmmaker who can push the medium."
262,"Who is Batman?Whats his history?When was his first appearance?Millionaire Bruce Wayne was just a kid when he watched his parents get gunned down during a mugging in Gotham City. The crime would define his life, as he dedicated himself to becoming the world's greatest weapon against crime—the Batman.His first appearance was in spring 1940 in DC comic books.Like all of the Christopher Nolan's movies(Prestige,Inception) all characters and events in this movie are complicated and intriguing.Batman whose his parents were killed in vain by a criminal that arouse a feeling of grudge about him and made a weakness in him.Back to his childhood,once he fell into a well while playing and that time the Bats surrounded him and a kind of fear of Bats formed in him.After that his father like a savior comes and take him out of the well but after that he dies.What will happen to a person when his/her figure dies? The answer is simple and it happens to him.Exile to an unknown place to mourn or fear or whatever he can call it sadness.then Ra's Al Ghul comes to him and offers him what to be called the right path and for that he goes to seek redemption after some physical and spiritual training the bid for killing an innocent person he refuses and it results in destroying Ra's Al Ghul base which he could not forget forever.After hearing the jury of his parents killer he decides to come back for him and take a revenge but what he found left from Gotham city was just the lurking villains,devastation,corrupted polices,poverty and sadness of the city but the only thing he can think of was just revenge that did not end up well.What that is significance about the movie is to confront your fears until you don't confront your fears you cant do anything.The matter that Wayne takes care to some extent.for his richness he builds some extraordinary machines which helps him to fight with more accuracy but he lacks something.Dealing with his old fears that was bats and he understands how to deal with it.Another good impression about this movie is the devastation and misunderstanding of truth and the right path that lets Ra's Al Ghul to come and think that there is no good human in this damn city and he should clear it from top to bottom to clear the abomination.However,there were good people in the city like Gordon but they were in minority and this matter encourages Batman to fight evil an at last good take overs the bad but this is not the end...What that is interesting about Batman Begins is not only it is symbolic but also we can feel it in our daily life.Gotham is like all the cities and we can see vice in our city but we cant see any Batman.Batman is not an invulnerable person like Superman and it means in this wickedness of society every one of us can be a Batman in some sort but we should sacrifice our good things and tackle our fears.Another feature of Batman that is very admiring is that he never kills anybody.At the end of the movie he tells Ra's Al Ghul that I don't kill you and I don't save you."
263,"After the fans disappointment with the film Batman And Robin there was absolutely no more interest in seeing another Baman film. But then comes along a much more serious film in the series that was intended to start the whole franchise over with a new director Christopher Nolan who wanted intentions to start the franchise over.The film is about Batman/BruceWayne now played by Christian Bale who after his parents got killed wants to train to become a superhero to Gotham City. This training goes on for half of the movie. The second half is about him going after 2 villains Rhas Al Guhl played by Liam Neeson who goes by the name of Henry Ducard to hide his identity. The second villain is Dr. Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow played by Cillian Murphy who sprays people with a fear gas.This is a nice addition to the series but is too long And it drags but I still enjoy it enough to recommend it.Rated PG-13 For Intense Action Violence, Disturbing Images And Some Thematic Elements.2hrs 20min/140min.***/****"
264,"Batman begins shows an interesting plot, the journey of how a young Bruce Wayne transforms into Batman...but still there are many issues on this film that just don't make sense and conflict with the first sagas from Tim Burton.It is a fact that Jack Napier aka The Joker killed Bruce Wayne parents, why is it that we see that a small crook kill Bruce Wayne's parents in this film?...its conflicting with the original story...also we see a presentation card of The Joker at the end of the movie...wain't the Joker made by Batman when he released him into the acid on the first picture??...too many flaws...Christian Bale overworks also the Batman voice...As for Gotham City...the worst Gotham I've seen....The best Gotham City was the one that Burton portrayed on the first 2 movies....it was gothical...AGAIN ''GOTHICAL''... and dark....This Gotham looks like a futuristic metropolis with elevated trains everywhere...what the hell is that?? Anyway...Burton was the man..."
265,"I'm literally blown away right now. Just saw it on DVD. Wish I had seen it in the theater now. The commercials while in the theater didn't start to represent how much this movie was about. I'm from the Tim Burton era of Batman movies and enjoyed the first and second ones. Now this movie is a different world, different style.. almost so much its nonsense to compare the two directors Batman movies here. This was a very powerful movie well directed and really wraps you in. Really was a perfect balance of action and drama. The characters were great, the acting on spot and the dialogue and script couldn't have been better. Now I am at a point where I wonder if another should be made or not. The ending eludes to another. But this was so good I hate to see a crummy sequel franchise ruin the name of this one really good one."
266,I found this the most entertaining of the non animated batman series. Primarily due to the fact that the script humanizes the protagonist more than the previous ones. Also some of the situations that he has to face seems plausible and thus more real. They do however have some serious reality flaws that can be easily overlooked in lieu for the entertainment factor. I was disappointed with Katie Holmes dialogue delivery. She always looks like a petulant novice who cannot deliver a single sentence without batting her eyelids several times. Also Bale talks like a wasp bit him on his tongue while in his role as Bruce. But when he is bat man he talks like he has a severe case of constipation.All in all this is an entertaining movie sans the bugbears
267,"will everyone please stop talking about a batman with another joker in it... it has already been done and they only put the calling card in it to tie the movie in with the original... even if they do try another batman with joker the actors especially in the jokers part better be pretty dam good playing the role because jack Nicholson nailed it down pat... if they don't then bale and whoever plays a role in the batman w/joker movie, if it happens, will be committing career suicide... if they are making another movie i suggest that it should erase or try and redo clooneys batman because it looked more like a bad theater film than a movie.. as for the villains i say make one with another 2face or Mr. freeze or even more out there bring back the penguin... just please please stop suggesting another joker movie..."
268,"I'm 49. I've been around through all sorts of versions of Batman. I can recall the Silver Age Batman (which also included Batwoman, Bat-Girl and Bat-Mite and Ace the Bat-Hound..yes, BAT-HOUND). I watched as Batman came to the TV screen with Adam West. I've seen the Burton Batmans and the Shumacher Batmans...I've seen frank Miller's Batman etc etc..... This film was good. It had its strong points. It was certainly better than the last few films. CBale was great and the supporting cast was excellent. But I'm not sure why everyone is falling over themselves in praise for the film. Sure, it's entertaining and mostly never dragged. But it just didn't seem all that classic or GREAT.I cant say what was missing for me or what would have made it better (I'd give it a B+ or 3 stars) but I prefer BATMAN with Keaton and Nicholson myself. I enjoyed the film but can't say I'd ever sit through it again. It was dark and gritty and clever..... I enjoyed THE SHADOW (1994) more with its 1030's style and wit. I wouldn't say this revolutionized the comic book movie. It borrowed from what's already been done in the comics to revolutionize comics. I didn't see it as leaps and bounds better than the SPIDERMAN films or X-MEN films. Don't get me wrong...I liked it ..but not enough to say it's the best ever comic book film or even the best version of Batman ever done."
269,"May Contain Spoilers: This movie has scenes that make me think it was shot as an R movie and edited to PG13. Parents: keep your children under 13 away from this one. This has aspects of a horror movie. The insane asylum scenes belong in a George Romero movie and the hallucinations in a John Carpenter movie. Kids under 13 might get nightmares from these.This movie is SUPER LOUD. Bring two sets of ear plugs and sit in the back row.It's 135 million dollars of FX with a trite plot and one dimensional characters thrown in. What's bad about the movie: The ninja scenes are trite garbage. The editing is confused. The few attempts at humor aren't funny. The end sequence is lame.The movie spends time showing why Batman is Batman but the attempts to develop the character relationships are unconvincing and poorly written.The plot is trite as are the FX.About the characters: Mr. Bale could have been good if he was given any decent lines. Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman seem way out of place in this action movie. (Freeman said he only did it for the money.)What's good about the movie: The Batmobile chase scene is exciting."
270,"For some reason ""Batman Begins"" turned out to be an elusive one, even though I manged to strike ""The Dark Knight"" off the list last year. After watching it, I realised what magnificent piece Christopher Nolan has managed to pull off. Indeed he has put in quite an effort to give the character the depth it needed to distinguish itself from the rest of super-hero movies. Bruce Wayne attempt to fight-off his gremlins was quite interesting and so was the revenge of his father's death. His relationship with Rachel Dawes, Lucius Fox & Alfred is fleshed out effectively. Christian Bale deserves brownie points for getting into the skin of the character(s).Katie Holmes seemed rehashed version of Mary Jane Watson. Michael Caine, Liam Neeson & Morgan Freeman provide adequate support to to the super-hero.Tom Wilkinson left a impression.Gary Oldman deserves special mention as he manages to pull-off a role every time. This time around again I failed to recognise him.If you are a fan of Batman or not - go for it, regardless."
271,"OK. this was great for the first hour. Really great. But then the director tries to go all ""action"" and ""goth"" on us. As in the the first half of the film uses beautiful locations, and the second half just uses grimy locations (just like EVERY OTHER FILM ""TRYING"" TO BE DARK!!!) And the action is so poorly filmed that you can't really see what's going on. If you want to see something ssssooo much more....well, more everything...watch hard boiled ( not the dubbed version). I will say that C.Bale was awesome. if not a little to OLD looking to be playing a youngish twenty something at the beginning of the film."
272,"For those who may know how the origins of how Bruce Wayne became to be as ""Batman"",here are some synopsis of how it really began. For one he witness the brutal murder of his parents when he was young boy and from there he went on to become a one-man vigilante taken on those who do mortally wrong and from there seek revenge on the murder of his parents. He is the eyes of justice and the protector of the innocent and for one was also known as the Caped Crusader,as well as The Dark Knight. Since the origins of ""Batman"",which was created by Bob Kane in 1939,the franchise has gone from the days of the comic books to a fifteen chapter movie serial in the 1940's,to the campy TV show of the 1960's, to the last two big-screen adaptions of the late 1990's,The Dark Knight has been anything but dark. For one he's been eclipsed by his enemies,made bland by studio decision-makers and afflicted with a too-suave attitude that made him seem more than nothing more like James Bond with a utility belt. From the first two ""Batman"", films that came out during the late 1980's and early 1990's that were directed by Tim Burton,""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" were very successfully until the onslaught on the last two installments of the series since the franchise downhill which at the time never recovered which were directed by Joel Schumacher whose last two films ""Batman Forever"" and the loud unnecessary and dreadful ""Batman and Robin"",killed it sending the franchise into a eight-year hiatus never to be heard from again. From the lead actors that played the Dark Knight from Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer not to mention George Clooney were optional to played the role but only in my opinion the only actor who portrayed the Caped Crusader that really made the character stand out was Michael Keaton who gave it is style and substance to the role,and from there after the last ""Batman"" film directed by Burton,it started out turning from brooding and fantastic and then turned to campy,pathetic and stupid,which in fact turn ""Batman"" fans away. Not to mention lame sidekicks,and outlandish villains also killed it too. Until now.""Batman Begins"",directed by Christopher Nolan(""Memento"",""Insomnia"")has given the franchise a needed boost and does it ever succeed its objective. What Nolan has done here was restored and refreshen one of the most lucrative comic-book franchises in motion picture history and its a very far cry from the previous installments which killed it especially the last installment that was made in 1997. However,""Batman Begins"" is more into the comic book version and this time around what Nolan did was focus on the origins of Bruce Wayne and how he was destined to be....The Dark Knight. It has been eight years since the last ""Batman"" installment and DC Comics and Warner Brothers(the studio behind the ""Superman"",""Lethal Weapon"",and ""Harry Potter"" films)were getting killed off in the competition of superheroes as they were being left in the dust as Marvel Comics dominated the theatres and chalking up winners left and right(the glorious and imaginary ""Blade"",""The X-Men"",and ""Spider-Man"" franchises)made a return to the silver screen with the definitive caped crusader adventure. Not only did Nolan make changes to the franchise,but gave it a much darker and sinister tone not to mention hell-bent on revenge. This time around ""Batman"" is by himself. Gone are the silly sidekicks,outlandish freaky villains,and stupidical story lines that almost sent the ""Batman"" franchise into a Hollywood graveyard of action films never to be heard from again. But here is what is interesting about the new installment that makes this a bona fide winner. Here is a confident storyline the starts the ""Batman"" series at ground zero and from there builds momentum as it moves along gracefully with full intense action sequences kick in for maximum enjoyment. This was a polar opposite of the last four films,which in turn went into pop culture and big-budget entertainment. Here screenwriter David Goyer(""Blade"")and director Christopher Nolan returns the Dark Knight to his original origins based on the comic books reflecting the character as a person and a human being. But fans of the series will be in for a shock and a rude awakening since some of the scenes here are very graphic and are inappropriate for younger children.As for the cast,it boasts a grand line-up of talent. From Oscar Winning actors Morgan Freeman and Micheal Caine to somewhat an all-British entourage with features Gary Oldman,Tom Wilkinson,Cillian Murphy(as the villain Scarecrow)not to mention actress Katie Holmes. But the real star of ""Batman Begins"" and the center of attention is actor Christian Bale,who deserves a heap of credit for making the character come to life and come together with great authenticity and he does a excellent job. Bale brings a psychological approach to the character,making him a person of crafty intelligence and sheer qualities to the role. He reinvents the Bruce Wayne character by going deep into the role and it is a deciding factor in a film that goes by grand design and basically strips the franchise down and rebuilds it and from there he gives The Dark Knight authority without either winking or a lot of unnecessary talking and from there the realism of how the character is given says a lot more about the film in general without all the mayhem and without much assistance from some of the special effects needed.In all ""Batman Begins"" is the thrill ride of the summer. And how they reconstructed the franchise basically says it all,especially for the film's final moment in which ""Batman"" takes on ""The Scarecrow"" which superby sets up the villain for the next installment,scheduled for release in the summer of 2007. ""Batman Begins"" retains the true origins of the comic book mood,which gives it a more darker,vengeful tone. And from the Christopher Nolan has done a masterful job of bringing back an American Icon."
273,"Nolan's first tryst with the comic character Batman and his much popularized Gotham City and it's infamous villains. This movie introduces the character Batman to the world thus explaining how Batman was born which has references from his childhood, killing of his parents etc. This movie focuses more on establishing Bruce Wayne's character, his ideals, his love, his passions etc. His relationships with the other important characters of the Batman comic series such as Alfred, Lucius, Rachel, Gordon etc is being highlighted more in this movie. The villains in this movie are The Scarecrow and Henri Ducard who pose a probable threat to the peace of Gotham. The very stylish and very technology-friendly bat-accessories are a treat to watch such as the bat suit, the bat automobile etc .Christian Bale perfectly fits in the role of Batman. And he is well supported by Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and others. This is one of the most real adaptations of a comic book character . A sure watch Rating : 7.5/10"
274,"Eight years after the apparent flop of ""Batman and Robin"", the Batman franchise have been begging for a new adaptation, with a new and improved origin. This has been successfully accomplished in ""Batman Begins"". The movie begins. A new Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), a new Batman, a new origin story. The film is very interesting and extremely compels the viewers with an engaging story-line complimented by wonderful performances from the entire cast (although the whole, Batman-has-a-deep-and-rough-voice thing can become tedious) makes this not just a great superhero movie, but a great movie in general; even for those who have (somehow) never heard of Batman. Christian Bale is great as Bruce Wayne/Batman, giving a realistic depiction of how Bruce Wayne would actually act. The antagonists are believable, with clear and developed motives, making the film impossible NOT to understand! The sets are exceptional with amazing cinematography, which also highly compliment the plot. A must-see as a film, and an exceptional superhero film."
