0,"I loved the cop working with the killer. He's playing both side trying to save himself and stop the killer. And the added element of the endless day light was another great ingredient.Pacino as usual gives an outstanding performance. He made me tired just watching him. He did great at his progression of looking more and more tired. And he does these little things you don't normally see actors do. I don't know if I can explain it. But he seems comfortable to the point that he's outside the box and it adds reality.Hilary Swank was great as the young doe eyed cop. She had that look of enthusiasm and optimism in her eyes. And the way that she always looked at Pacino. She was starting out and he was ending. You can see it in both of their faces.Robin Williams was a different but great choice. He's obviously a good actor, we've known that. But we've never seen him like this before. He has some kind of sadness in his face and voice. Something that evokes your sympathy. You didn't want to believe the he was a killer and wanted to believe his story that the murder wasn't his fault. But then his calm passivity becomes creepy and scary. You know what he did the whole time and the fact that he's this calm about it makes him scary.This has two of the best/inventive chases I've ever seen. The foggy beach and the logs in the water. Not only does it utilize the area but it's different. Chasing someone in the fog where you can't see a thing and the killer could be right in front of you is good suspense. And on the beach with big rocks so you have to keep looking where you're going.The logs in the water is everything dangerous: fast, always moving, with the threat of drowning and the ground is unstable. When he falls in the sound was very good at conveying the power of the crashing logs.This was also a good remake. They took the story, made it their own and Americanized it. I hate it when a remake doesn't add anything new. If you're going to make it in a different country, make it in a different country. Don't do what ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" did. The Norwegian one is very good and worth watching.You know you're a good director when this is your least good movie. Of course at the time this was from the guy that did ""Memento."" We had no idea what the future held for this great director's career. His talent is evident here. Any director could have made this movie but he really added those extra touches to make it stand out"
1,"Since the release of ""Memento"" (which I honestly haven't seen yet) Christopher Nolan has become a rising star in the world of film directing. And he finally shined with both ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" which revitalized the Batman character and established it as the most popular and even putting him above Spider-man. The fact is, Nolan is among the greatest film-makers in the world and he is going to keep making new classics for the years to come, and I'm already looking forward to ""Inception"" in 2010. In 2002, he directed a remake of the Norweigian film of the same name called ""Insomnia"", and I gotta say, it's the best psychological thriller I've ever seen and it even surpasses ""The Silence of the Lambs"" big time.The premise-A highly known and highly accomplished Los Angeles detective named Will Dormer (Al Pacino) is sent to a town in Alaska to solve a murder case involving a 17 year old girl. But his partner Hap, just revealed to him that he's planning on testifying against him because he knows about Dormer planting evidence to gain a conviction on a previous case. And all that guilt, fear and the midnight sun that is constantly shining sends Dormer a whole week of no sleep (insomnia). And Dormer starts to lose his concentration and his reasoning. Al Pacino has been known for dominating every movie he's in and stealing the show from the other actors and he totally does that in here. And it also seems that he was perfectly cast in here because he has the look of a guy who hasn't slept in days. And that might be due to his facial appearance with the dark circles under his eyes and his wrinkled face and he even looks tired the moment he gets off the plane at the beginning. And the more days that pass, he looks more and more fatigued. And I wonder if Pacino really kept himself awake during filming or if he's really that good as a method actor. Although fatigue is the main emotion that he demonstrates here, his feeling of guilt is masterfully shown after he accidentally kills his partner in the thick fog while they're chasing the killer. And we, as the audience wonder if it was really a mistake, or if he shot him on purpose to shut his partner up and prevent his testimony. And Dormer even does some extreme measures to cover up what really happened. At the end, the question is never answered and we're left wondering about his morality and how ethical of a cop he really is. And also the scene when he confronts the victim's boyfriend (whose a smart-mouth, always doing his ""f**k the world act"") and he really shuts him up. I personally thought that was pretty darn cool and he really fits into the mind of Will Dormer and gives one of his finest performances ever.Robin Williams, who plays as the girl's killer, is known for doing comedy roles and he should start listening to everyone's advice and stick to doing dramatic or serious roles, because he is WAY better when he's doing the kind of acting he does in ""Insomnia"". He actually doesn't start showing his face until about half-way through the movie and spends the first half either hiding his face or giving sinister, yet strangely non-threatening phone calls to Dormer. And it turns out that he saw Dormer shoot his partner and spends the rest of the movie blackmailing him and forces him to pin the murder of the girl on someone else. Hilary Swank gives perhaps the 2nd best acting performance and once again, Nolan casted her perfectly as the detective who idolizes Dormer. I guess it has to do something with the way Swank's mannerisms are like. And she's totally believable as the character who looks up to Dormer and she seems like she wants to impress him all the time. And she cuts Dormer some slack even though he gives a vague explanation for an incident involving an officers death. Having a trio of former Oscar winners really helped the film here, and also was the masterful direction of Nolan, he makes the scenery of Alaska somewhat peaceful, yet disturbing. And as all psychological thrillers go...u have to keep the suspense and tension going though the whole move....otherwise, what's the point? At first, you can feel the tension between Dormer and his partner, and then between Dormer and the killer. This is simply the best psycho-thriller I've ever seen, and if you think that ""The Silence of the Lambs"" was something, wait 'till you see this!"
2,"Al Pacino is an L.A. cop who's come to Alaska with his partner to investigate a brutal homicide. Hilary Swank is the Alaskan detective who admires his work and methods. Robin Williams is the killer they're hunting down. (All three are Oscar winners by the way, and deliver performances that are definitely worthy of an Oscar.) Throughout the film, Pacino's character's mind wreaks havoc; the Alaskan town is so far up north, they get ""white nights"" (I.e. the sun doesn't set for half the year). As a result, he cannot sleep.With ""Insomnia"", Christopher Nolan joins my list of directors I admire. ""Insomnia"" owes much of its stunning success to the directorial choices Nolan makes. The most difficult task of the movie is this: how exactly can you show the audience Pacino's increasingly disoriented, sleepless mind-frame, without boring them? I think Nolan handles this expertly.The cast deliver stellar performances, in particular Robin Williams. His character is undoubtedly psychotic. What a temptation for Williams to steal the show with a display of angry shouting, of pure psychopathic hostility, of maniacal laughter! But no. He avoids this and goes for a far different touch. His character talks of extremely disturbing things in a very calm, matter-of-fact way, making his performance far more bone-chilling. As much as I love Williams' comic roles, I have to admit he's practically unrivalled in ""serious"" acting.Another thought: although this is a film I like to consider a thriller, it is very much like a film noir as well. Personally, I love the plots of film noirs, but I can't stand the relentless usage of shadows and dark lighting. ""Insomnia"" shatters these guidelines. It is a very dark film with lots and lots of light. The effect is interesting to say the least.This film is a thriller, and consequently, I'm choosing my words carefully in order to spoil as little of the film as possible. I highly recommend seeing this film— I was blown away. ""Insomnia"" is also very deep, powerfully invoking themes of guilt and restlessness. I do not regret buying this film: I confidently call it a great movie.Note: Apparently, ""Insomnia"" is a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgård. I haven't seen it, but if it was anything close to as good as this film, whoever does see it is in for a real treat!"
3,... just how people can give a film luke this 1/10. I mean... the dross that is churned out by Hollywood on a yearly.basis... this comes along and has such a mixed following. Acting perfect with Pacino giving one his best performances. Williams is perfect as the murderer and Swamp although not a major character is fine. The shooting is class as is the stunning soundtrack. A work of art that will over more time be appreciated
4,"This 2002 film directed by Christopher Nolan is an underrated gem. Its setting, and cinematography feed into its isolation. A film about guilt, right or wrong, action and intent, and moral compromise. This film is edited well, along Christoper Nolan directing into a great way. Pacino gives a standout performance, and so does Robin Willams. Doorman's history of manipulating evidence based off his own personal opinion clouds his consciousness. His then accidental killing of his partner, furthers that, as he struggles with his distinction of action and intent. He then begins to suffer from Insomnia. While Finch claims to also suffer from it, as he proclaims to accidentally killing the girl. Finch witnessed Doorman kill his partner, and so they are forged to ""work together"". And you dont know who to trust. In the end Doorman does the right thing, and dies in the process. He tells Elllie that she can ruin his reputation, as he is released from his Insomnia and can finally sleep This visually stunning and edge of your seat psychological thriller is a gem. Nolan does it again. Atmospheric, brillant, tightly woven, detailed, and perfect. Alaska: stays light outside for the entire day for 5 months, ""Days never end"""
5,"When you have three Academy Award Winners in one picture, it's destined to be terrific or downright terrible. This movie is terrific. The funny thing is I didn't realize how good it was until about four years later. Time has a way of blurring your memory and mine is more blurred than most. You can't forget this one however because it sticks in your head and won't come out. The cinematography is superb and the lines are, in several places, quite unique and memorable. I will always remember at the end, feeling Dormer's (Pacino) insomnia. Literally feeling it. And obviously, I've been there. I once went eight whole days without a night's sleep. Don't ask me how, but I did. And after that much sleeplessness, it begins to mess with you. I have only seen about ten minutes of the original film on which this film is based, not because I got bored and turned it off, but because I didn't realize what I was watching. If I had, I most certainly would have watched the whole thing. Robin Williams was an illogical but certainly credible, deserved, and welcome addition to this film, and anyone who says he plays something other than what he actually plays didn't pay close attention. He is always good for an unexpected performance. Do yourself a favor, study this film. Really study it. A true work of art if there ever was one on film."
6,"Whenever Al Pacino appears in a film you can just bet the film is going to be a complete knock out punch for the viewers. In this picture, Al Pacino (Detective Will Dormer,),""Any Given Sunday"",'99, plays a very successful cop who has a very keen sense in a crime situation and can almost smell the criminal. When Det. Dormer questions a suspect he looks right through them and his questions turn them into pure Butter. Hilary Swank,(Det. Ellie Burr),""The Core"",'03, simply had the hots for Will Dormer and adored his great history of solving crimes over the many years. Robin Williams, (Walter Finch),""One Hour Photo"",'02, gave an outstanding supporting role, who played a real weird character who wanted to work out a deal with Will Dormer to solve his problems and Will's. The moral to this story is that the Truth is the only path to follow in any situation in LIFE."
7,"Knowing that Al Pacino and Robin Williams co-star in Christopher Nolan's ""Insomnia"", we would probably expect Pacino to play an evil antagonist and Williams a wacky protagonist. But it's not like that. It's not the opposite, either. The description of the movie's plot needs to be a long one.Pacino plays LA detective Will Dormer, under investigation by internal affairs for misconduct. That's when the sleep-deprived Dormer - note the irony in his surname - gets sent to Alaska to catch a killer in a small town. Upon arriving, Dormer quickly learns that in Alaska during the summer, the sun never sets. Already beginning to lose his mind due to events back home, Dormer falls apart further as he unsuccessfully tries to cover up the sunlight in his hotel room. Probably the best representation of his mental breakdown is what he does with the floorboard.But the hitherto events are nothing compared to what follows. While investigating a crime scene, Dormer kills a partner. Not only does he have this on his consciousness, but he gets a call from Walter Finch (Robin Williams), the man whom he is supposed to catch. Finch knows what Dormer did. Almost all events from henceforth will serve to show Dormer's breakdown and how Finch can use it against him.I don't know whether I would call ""Insomnia"" an absolutely perfect movie, but it's pretty close. One of the most effective scenes - at least in my view - is Dormer running through the empty street in the middle of the night, which of course looks like it could be midday. This potentially friendly small town has turned into the cruelest of settings for Dormer. No character is really a hero or villain; everyone seems to be a little bit of both. Equally as good as Pacino and Williams is Hilary Swank as Ellie Burr, a detective participating in the investigation. Seemingly a nice young woman, even she might have a few skeletons in her closet.All in all, I certainly recommend this movie. Christopher Nolan brought to it the same intensity that he instilled in ""Memento"", and showed the sorts of tricks that he would later bring to ""Batman Begins"". Above all, it was part of what I called Robin Williams's comeback in 2002: aside from his comedy tour (which I saw when he came to Portland), he played sinister roles in ""Death to Smoochy"", ""Insomnia"" and ""One Hour Photo"", so as to make up for the excessively maudlin ""Jakob the Liar"" and ""Bicentennial Man"".So the next time that the sun doesn't set, just be careful..."
8,"Superb performance from Al pachino late Robin Williams, Martin and Hillary Swank.. this film is Nolan's most underrated film.. I often watch this crime drama At least twice a year... The soundtrack is so great and adds to the insomniac theme of film.. the editing choice is too great.. at times I felt like incomprehensible like I feel the characters in movie... Even without time complexity, Nolan can deliver straight up crime thriller with such conviction and talent.. for me it's 10/10."
9,"Insomnia is a terrific thriller with a really smart idea of a bleak mystery and spiral into corruption set against constant daylight that prevents anything being hidden. It's definitely one of the best remakes of a European film that's a lot less bleak than the original whilst still bringing plenty of moral greys.Al Pacino and Robin Williams are the pillars of this film and both play against type to great effect. Al Pacino has a few well placed moments of his loud rage but for the most part remains increasingly tired whilst still clearly giving it all. Robin Williams dials down the manic energy completely for a much quieter and unnerving performance.Christopher Nolan's direction is really impressive, going from micro to mid budget pretty flawlessly a way few filmmakers get the chance to these days. It may not bend time like what comes before and after but that's still here and the set pieces are thrilling. The music by David Julyan is amazing, so haunting and effective at communicating Dormer's growing confusion and exhaustion."
10,"Although I love this film and rate it ten out of ten, I do admit that there's something missing, and I can't quite put my finger on exactly what that ""something"" is.  However, I think that if anything was added to compensate for that missing ""something"" the eerie subtly of everything would be trampled.I think a large part of Insomnia's effectiveness has as much to do with David Julyan's film score as it does with Pacino and Williams' wonderful performances.  Sure, the entire movie is ""bleak"" and gloomy (and the score sure adds to it), but what do you expect from a movie with a plot that revolves the murder of a young girl?  You sure as heck don't walk into the theater expecting some feel-good, heartwarming piece of crap that you'd see any other time of the year, that's for sure. We need more movies like Chris Nolan's Insomnia; it's unrelenting yet delicate, and I think that's what's putting people off.  What many want are macho brawling fistfights between Williams and Pacino, but what they get are pensive and thought-provoking dialogue (plus a little shootout near the end.)  Personally, I'm glad we get to see Williams and Pacino talk things out most of the time instead of beating the crap out of eachother in every scene.  They'd be wasting their talent if there was no dialog interaction between the two.My rating: ten out of ten"
11,"(Possible spoilers ahead)Ok, that might sound like a cliche line for Insomnia, a remake here of the 1997 foreign version with Stellan Skarsgard, but why not once in a blue moon.  Anyway, this is indeed a topper for Christopher Nolan, over his 2001 independent backwards episode Memento, and brings his storytelling skills to a thriller set in Alaska.  Thus, Al Pacino plays the cop, a usual part to be sure, yet here brings an excellent feeling of desperation to try and find a way out of the muck of lies and torment that are in his life.  And for once, Alaska is shown as it truly is, either all night or all day (there are so many movies that get this wrong it's too lengthy to explain here) and how either one can drive the particular person crazed.  Here it is the constant shining of a itty bit of sunlight into his room at 3:30 AM.Pacino is on the case of a killer (Robin Williams) who's victim is a teenage girl.  This is handled in a good way, by turning it into not a cops and and bad guys movie, but more of a moral movie, one about getting caught in the most stressful of situations in dealing with control over life and the responsibility it follows.  It is not just the acting, which is above par, but also just the downright craft that drags you into the predominately first person dilemma (although Williams brings up some interesting points among his blackmail).  One more note: Williams has done something this year to me I'm not sure he's ever done- he has two movies from this year that are both grand dramatic, crazed performances and among his flops and utter misdemeanors (including another one he did this year, Death to Smoochy) there is a bit of praise for the guy.  As for the thriller here, one of the years best in conclusion. A+"
12,"I can't believe I never found out about this movie. I watched it just recently. Al Pacino and Robin Williams were great! I never thought Robin Williams could do serious work. He was very serious in this one. He was also very serious in the movie The Final Cut. This story is about a Cop from Los Angeles traveling to Alaska in regards to a murder of a 17 year old girl who had been brutally bashed to death. What Pacino didn't know was that the sun never goes down in Alaska in Winter. It effects his sleeping patterns and gets dizzy every day. Pacino then bumps into a dark mysterious writer named Walter Finch. Everyone thinks he's the murderer. But is he? You'll have to watch the film to find out. The director Christopher Nolan did a great job at keeping the camera still. It never moved or bounced up and down once. he always kept it straight and still. Great action, acting and directing. I give this movie a solid, but funky 10/10."
13,"In this incredibly well written movie, Al Pacino plays a legendary LA homicide detective sent to Alaska to solve a murder that the locals are probably not properly trained to handle. Unbeknownst to the local police department in Alaska, Pacino is dealing with his own problems, problems that could in effect ruin everything he has ever worked for.As the movie progresses, we are introduced to a character played by Robin Williams. Williams' character is highly intelligent and way beyond the intellectual level of the locals investigating the murder. To be honest, this is quite disappointing to Williams' character, as he wants someone to know just how brilliant he is. Pacino provides WIlliams with that one intellectual equal that will be impressed with the fellow genius. However, Pacino's character is dealing with a life spiraling down the toilet and is far from impressed with the regaling of how somebody murdered a teenager. In one of the greatest pieces of dialog ever, Pacino (Dormer), confronts Williams (Finch) with the following, as FInch eagerly awaits some sort of accolades:""You don't get it do you, Finch? You're my job. You're what I'm paid to do. You're about as mysterious to me as a blocked toilet is to a fucking plumber. Reasons for doing what you did? Who gives a fuck?""After this, we see that both men are far from popular with the other and neither has much of a future.Strongly recommend the film. It is not a sunny film, even though the sun never sets in the Alaskan town where the event take place. This is an ugly film, filled with abusive boyfriends, misogynist deputies, and insecure police officers. But in the end, we are left with some ray of hope for redemption."
14,"This film is a detective story with a very particular and also quite messy plot that manages to extricate itself throughout its duration without ever confusing the viewer, let's say that it is one of the most complex plot detective stories I've ever seen explained in the most effective and simple way that there is. However, we must also talk about the masterful interpretation of the actors which we say was quite obvious looking at the name of the actors who are the protagonists of this beautiful film. In addition to the plot and staging, the whole work has a beautiful aura of lucid confusion that also envelops the viewer as he watches it."
15,"Despite being one of the lowest rated films by Nolan, it remains my personal favorite.Christopher Nolan's direction in ""Insomnia"" is tense and atmospheric, emphasizing the isolated and haunting Alaskan setting. His direction maintains a sense of ambiguity and moral complexity, blurring the lines between right and wrong, and presenting morally compromised characters.Al Pacino delivers a strong and compelling performance as Detective Will Dormer. Pacino effectively conveys the character's internal turmoil, guilt, and exhaustion, adding depth and complexity to the role.Robin Williams departs from his typical comedic roles to portray Walter Finch, the enigmatic and sinister suspect. Williams showcases his versatility as an actor, delivering a chilling and nuanced performance that adds a layer of psychological intrigue to the film.""Insomnia"" delves into themes of guilt, deception, the consequences of one's actions, and the fragility of the human mind under extreme circumstances. The film explores the psychological toll of insomnia, blurring the lines between reality and hallucination."
16,"I didn't know what to expect from this film. Upon watching The Dark Knight Rises only a few days earlier, I had heard that this was Nolan's worst film. Well, after seeing TDKR, which is riddled with unsubtle dialogue and bland pacing, I expected Insomnia to put me to sleep.It did not. In fact, it's now in my top three of favorite Nolan films.Here's why: Al Pacino gives a riveting and quite subtle performance as a detective plagued by mistakes in his past. As the mystery of a murder in a small Alaskan town begins to get more and more interesting, we learn more about how far Pacino's character is willing to go to reach justice, but we also see him falter, and succumb to more personal demons. It's a sublime performance, and I personally think he's one of Nolan's most layered and interesting characters.All other cast performances are amazing, including a memorable turn from Hillary Swank, who plays her role with a sense of keen suspicion and humbled intellect. But, the real standout next to Pacino is Robin Williams. I will give no spoilers about his character here, but when he's onscreen, it's easy to see why Williams won an Oscar years prior. He's a master of acting innocent but disturbed all at once. A truly gripping performance, that absolutely holds its own next to Pacino's greatness.The real beauty here is Nolan's direction. The tension is palpable, and is far more engaging and riveting than the few action scenes the film has, (though the action itself is great too!) The cinematography is top-notch, and really brings you into this small town world, adding a sense of paranoia and constant fear to each scene, as if someone is always watching, and no secret is truly unknown. Nolan creates an atmosphere through the performances that is perfect, and added to the location and cinematography, all three of them blend together strongly to form a fully matured motion picture. Truly worthy of being called a ""thriller"" in every sense of the word. Nolan's pacing may be off in TDKR, but not in Insomnia. Definitely not in Insomnia.I was truly mesmerized at the moral quandaries the film presents. I can't speak too much about them since I don't want to give spoilers, but no other film I've seen, especially a detective film, has dealt and shown grief and regret in such a fascinating way. The lines in this world are grey, and even the best people make mistakes. Mistakes which the characters much learn to live with in order to fit their own justice. Its engaging questions and themes are explored in depth, and never come off as preachy.In conclusion, Insomnia is truly one of Nolan's best, and is an underrated gem. Please watch this film. It deserves, and needs to be seen. A deep exploration of morality, filled with a tense atmosphere, and wonderful performances. Films like Insomnia are cinema at its grandest."
17,"This movie is arguably one of the best murder mystery movies I have seen since ""Laura"" (1944), ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991), and many of Alfred Hitchcock's movies, as well as being one of the best movies that Christopher Nolan ever directed, along with being one of the police movies that I have ever seen. The movie stars Al Pacino as William Dormer a Los Angeles a detective on the force for 30 years (and couldn't sleep) whose partner is a young detective named Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) who are sent up to Alaska to help a local police department in a small town called Nightmute in order to solve the case of the murder of a teenage girl. As soon as Dormer and his partner arrive they meet a young police detective who happens to be a big fan of Detective Dormer's work named Ellie Burns (Hilary Swank). Dormer also happens to be a good friend of the police chief there whose last name is Nyback (Paul Dooley). As soon as they get there things start kicking up to speed, the policemen/women find the supposed killer in the fog but weren't able to get him and as a result Dormer's partner dies under strange circumstances. During that case Dormer meets a crime novelist named Walter Finch (Robin Williams) who claims that he killed the girl and that Dormer killed his partner. Pacino, Williams, and Swank really deserved Oscar nominations for their excellent work in this movie, and it is also worth noting that Pacino played an LA cop in 1995's ""Heat"" that was another great performance but he had to deal with another acting titan in Robert De Niro.The movie isn't the best movie that Christopher Nolan directed but it is movies like this that are the reason why I consider him to be the modern version of Alfred Hitchcock, Nolan would eventually direct great films like ""Batman Begins"" (2005), ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), ""Inception"" (2010), ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012), and ""Interstellar"" (2014) all of those films were masterpieces and this one is right up there with them. I was very impressed with this movie, especially with Hillary Seitz's screenplay that wasn't adapted from anything but man did it work. The movie was brilliantly executed, and is one of 2002's very best films."
18,"Robin Williams really impresses...and in a role unlike we've ever seen him! I was flabbergasted to see him take on this type of persona, but it is definitely worthy of attention!  Congratulations, Robin, for a job well done!"
19,"I remember last summer when I had a bad case of insomnia due to nothin but fun. But when I saw the movie (2002 version), I was not only reminded of what no sleep is like, but what fun it was watching Al Pacino and Robin Williams become enemies.Los Angeles detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner are assigned to go to Alaska and uncover a mysterious murder of a 17 year old girl. When they arrive in Alaska, they are teamed up with beautiful police officer Ellie (Hilary Swank) and her squad. While trying to solve the case, Will begins to suffer from insomnia because of the summer non stop daylight. It even gets worse because while out hunting a suspect in the fog, Will accidently shoots his partner leaving him dead. Will recieves a call the next day from a mystery novelist (Robin Williams) who claims to be the murderer of the 17 year old girl and who saw Will murder his partner. It turns into nothing but a world of blackmail because the author threatens to turn Will in if there is no cooperation between the two.I honestly think that Christopher Nolan is going to be a success because of his first two movies. He did such a brilliant job, that he deserves the best director oscar next year. And, I vote Pacino for best actor."
20,"A visually stunning psychological thriller with fantastic performances and brilliant direction. Pacino owns his role as broken down detective dormer, and robin williams who i usually cant stand gives nothing short of his best performance ever. A must see. 10/10"
21,"I have not seen the original, but I will.  This movie was outstanding.  I would write outstanding in all caps, but I don't feel like yelling.  Pacino was the most engaging I have seen him since Scent of a Woman.  If you are a fan of acting and love the understated, you may feel Robin Williams gives his best performance in this movie.  I definitely do.  There are so many details to pour over; questions within questions with answers that perception and perspective can and will change for you. 
Why did Dormer hold so much inside?  Do we really believe that Finch believes he is innocent?  Everyone's actions and choices ride the film forward on a tightly wound and engaging suspension of disbelief.  At one point the movie almost broke in to a typical Hollywood-style chase scene - but the director immediate derailed it, with confidence, and plunged us (literally) right back in to our insomnia-induced sense of isolation and eeriness.Dormer/Pacino is the kind of cop with a gift that we are used to in movies. But he is a flawed cop who's gift may have become a crutch.  In the back-story it may have cost him his career.  With Finch/Williams (in the present) it may be clouding his vision more than the insomnia.  If you watch Memento enough, every detail makes sense.  Not so in Insomnia, logic (for the characters) is tossed aside early; bad and good dance and almost swap places.This movie is all about the struggle, but not in a way that we are used to. The motives aren't what you think.  The good guy has strayed from the path. The bad guy is sad, driven, compassionate and intelligent - if he wasn't so willing to wear his guilt, we might like him.  I am tired of black and white characters in movies.  This movie dons the gray cloak and shows all its wonderful shades.  If you can't tell already, for me, this movie was deeply satisfying and beautiful - and a guilty pleasure I will enjoy again soon."
22,This is without a doubt the best movie i've seen all year . christopher nolan proves himself again to be one the best directors around . Al Pacino yet again reinforces his legendary reputation as the most intense actor around . Williams is astounding as his quarry and alter - ego . All in all a must-see film .
23,"""Insomnia"" is not the kind of movie you expect to see this time of year. It's the kind of dark film studios usually save for fall release. The logic is that a) audiences are expecting more serious, dark material that time of year and b) it's positioned better for Oscar attention. Something has happened this summer, though. We seem to be getting back to the idea that summer is not just the time for dumbed-down action. It's the height of the movie box office season, period. If a movie is good, it has the best chance of being seen during this season. That has not been the way things have gone in recent years. The high-profile release of ""Insomnia"" release may be a sign that major movie studios have finally wised up.This summer, if schedules hold, we'll get Cold War thrillers ""Sum of All Fears"" and ""K-19: The Widowmaker."" We'll get the first major studio, serious crime film in a while, ""Road to Perdition.""  Are the days finally gone that true movie fans must spend spring and summer waiting for anything good to watch, settling for what amounts to garbage? I'm hopeful.By the way, I loved ""Insomnia."" It's the best film of the year so far. The film is a rare instance of a project living up to and far exceeding its potential. Sometimes the collaboration of great talent actually creates something great.Director Christopher Nolan, who only four years ago released his first film, ""Following"" on a shoestring budget shot with friends over a year of weekends. Only one print was made of the film at the time. Not knowing this, I was lucky enough to see it screened back in 1998 at a theater in Santa Monica. Only two other people were in the theater. The night before I saw it, Nolan held a Q & A session after the screening. I'm kicking myself now for not attending that. If only I'd had any idea what would happen next. In 2000, at the Toronto Film Festival, came ""Memento,"" and everything changed. A couple of struggling producers named Clooney and Soderbergh immediately recognized Nolan as having big-time potential and tapped him to direct ""Insomnia,"" their remake of the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name.I saw ""Insomnia"" on Memorial Day Sunday. The theater was packed.So now here is Nolan, having directed three Academy Award winners in a thriller that found itself taking advantage of a Memorial Day weekend left wide open by schedule shifts. The choice to release it at such a time would not have been made had this film not been so good. I believe that the studio took a look at it and said, 'this is great, people are going to love this. Now, when can we open?'Despite its big stars and probably big budget, ""Insomnia"" is remarkably tight. There's a subdued, perfectly channelled intensity throughout. Stylistically it's only a few clicks removed from `Memento.'  The two films look a lot alike.Each of the great actors, Pacino, Williams, and Swank accept themselves as pieces of Nolan's puzzle, snapping themselves in perfectly. They're the kinds of roles actors live for.Grade: A"
24,"Al Pacino's character looked tired when he arrived in the Alaskan town. As he attempts to reconcile a serious mistake, he grows wearier and wearier. Enter Robin Williams, a sociopath who plays a cat and mouse game with Pacino. Balance that against the perceptive and admiring Hillary Swank and a lot of baggage from Pacino, and you have the ingredients for a terrific thrill a minute film. I found myself rooting for the Pacino character even though there is a level of dishonesty that will be hard to reconcile. He must cover some huge tracks. There are some issues with Williams' ability to know things that are a little far fetched. Many villains fall into that gap, but that's OK. We take him for what he is. It's an engaging movie."
25,"I was really looking forward to this film, and I'm glad to say that I wasn't the least bit disappointed.  First of all, I was glad to see Al Pacino on screen again.  It seems like it's been a while since I've seen him on screen.  I think the last film he was in was ""Any Given Sunday.""  Pacino yet again delivers a brilliant performance, strapping the audience in for a wild ride through the emotionally scarred mind of Detective Will Dormer.  It seemed like I could feel his every emotion throughout the course of the movie.  Because this is a character-driven story that revolves around Dormer, his pain, anguish and guilt on account of accidentally taking his partner's life, constant insomnia and subsequent threats by his nemesis, played by Robin Williams as a writer of trashy detective novels who's fascinated by Dormer and blackmails him by threatening to spill out the secret of Dormer shooting his partner.  As for Robin Williams, he is fully convincing as the reclusive novelist/murderer of a 17-year-old girl.  I suspected, from the trailers, that he'd play a serial killer.  I wouldn't exactly classify his character as a serial killer, but he is the antagonist and a murderer and Williams plays the role perfectly, never underplaying it and never overplaying it.  He could've went over-the-top, playing a totally ruthless killer who cackles at the thought of murdering someone in cold blood.  Though he's not our sympathetic character, you do feel sympathy for him at times.  And I like how the story creates this little cat-and-mouse game between the two characters, each one plagued by skeletons in the closet.  Oscar-winner Hilary Swank delivers another fine performance, and I was stunned to see how amazingly attractive she looks, after having seen her gender-bending role as Brandon Teena in ""Boys Don't Cry.""
Christopher Nolan is the acclaimed director of ""Memento"" and he scores yet again, with this beautifully constructed thriller.  I was intrigued from start to finish.  Nolan's use of lighting is dark and murky, wonderfully setting the noirish tone.  Nolan shows great promise as an up-and-coming director, and with a good outlet he can possibly become the next Kubrick. I greatly look forward to seeing his next project, whenever that may be.I recommend ""Insomnia"" to anyone who loved Nolan's previous ""Memento"" or anyone who simply enjoys a great, multi-faceted mystery/thriller that will keep you guessing at every turn.  I think it's too early to vote this movie as one of the best films of 2002, but it's a possible candidate.  We don't see too many ""great"" films anymore, and whenever they're out there it's good to take advantage.My score:  9 (out of 10)"
26,"Christopher Nolan follows the flawless MEMENTO with this, another one-word title film and another inventive, superb effort. Based on a Norwegian movie (which I haven't, as yet, seen), this tells the oft-told tale of a world-weary cop vs. a nasty and particularly slimy killer. What makes it special is the script – very believable and down-to-earth – and the characters, who are so realistically drawn that you can easily believe they are living, breathing people. The setting of the icy, desolate Alaskan town is very good indeed, combined with excellent cinematography which brings out every characteristic of the location and makes it feel really unique. Nolan shoots his film expertly, mixing in some fine chase and action sequences (the log run is brilliantly conceived) with the heavier, more dramatic moments.Al Pacino is fine in the role of the ageing, flawed cop. Sure it's a performance we've all seen before but he makes it extra special with his singular powers of method acting and realism. You feel tired just looking at his weary, end-of-the-road cop. The supporting cast are all fine but it's Robin Williams who really steals the show as the killer, Finch. Williams is nasty, slimy, villainous, creepy, and totally scary, a mundane and quiet little man who's prone to bursts of a violent psychopathic nature. The film remains unpredictable throughout, letting the suspense build gradually as the cat-and-mouse storyline increases the tension, before ending in a sudden burst of violence and excitement. Magnificent stuff, sadly all too rare these days in Hollywood but a reminder of what a good director, a good script and a good cast can really do."
27,"""Invited to 'Nightmute', Alaska, to head a murder case, veteran LAPD detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) finds his investigation interrupted by an ever-shining midnight sun that wreaks sleep-depriving havoc on him - and by personal guilt over a second crime that may be real or a figment of his increasingly unstable consciousness,"" according to the DVD sleeve description.Director Christopher Nolan does an excellent job crafting a North American version of the original 1997 Norwegian crime drama, helped immensely by Hillary Seitz' intricate, intelligent adaptation.Also extraordinary are Mr. Pacino, cinematographer Wally Pfister, and editor Dody Dorn. Hilary Swank and Robin Williams effectively tone down their established personas. The smaller roles are beautifully realized - Paul Dooley, Larry Holden, Katharine Isabelle, Jonathan Jackson, Nicky Katt, and Maura Tierney deserve an ""ensemble cast"" award - and, Martin Donovan's ""Hap"" is particularly haunting.This film could have easily been nominated for six ""Academy Awards"" - but, probably, voters were sleepless in Chicago. Nevertheless, ""Insomnia"" shows Mr. Nolan, coming off ""Memento"" (2000), moving into the circle of upper echelon directors. Mr. Pfister knows how to hand-hold cameras, and Ms. Dorn's editing skills are sharp - hopefully, this team will receive some more film projects.********* Insomnia (5/3/02) Christopher Nolan ~ Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Martin Donovan"
28,"Insomnia is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated films of all time. It is a first class thriller, with brilliant performances, character depth,cinematography and a great score.Nolan is one the best new talents out there, and i can't wait for more of his stuff.A lot of thrillers rely upon a tense plot to keep the audience on the edge of their seats, films like Misery or maybe Fatal Atrraction. Insomnia has that, plus much, much more.Nolan's direction is flawless, and the Alaskan locations gives the film a great setting. It's also great to see Robin Williams in a role like this.I'd recommend it to anyone."
29,"Though Insomnia wasn't Robin Williams's first trip to the dark side, nor was it Al Pacino's first cop drama, it was, in fact, their best performances in their respectable roles as such.I truly liked this movie a lot. It had elements of The Silence of the Lambs and the beauty of Alaska. No one could've played a sleep-deprived cop like Pacino. He already looks 80% asleep in most of his roles. Williams was superb as the incredibly un-clichéd antagonist. His character, writer Walter Finch, was smart, but not brilliant. He actually seemed like how normal people would react if they were, in fact, in his predicament. And Hilary Swank, well, she's been better in other movies, and she's no Marge Gunderson (played by Frances McDormand in Fargo.) Yet, she did what she could and was still entertaining.That all said, the real stars of the movie were the fantastic script and scenery. Gorgeous locales that make you walk in their sleepwalking shoes. Thanks to the screenplay and backdrops, you could feel every ounce of pain that the Detective Will Dormer (Pacino) was feeling. Now, knowing his background and if he's really a good person, that'll take you a bit.A young girl is killed in the town of no sundown in Alaska (this period of the year, that is) and L.A. Detectives Dormer and Eckhart (Donovan) are called up North to assist the wet-behind-the-ears Ellie Burr (Swank) in solving it. Ellie's ecstatic: Dormer's her hero; she's written papers on him and memorized some of his statements. She's also naïve, but not entirely stupid.Apparently both Dormer & Eckhart had left L.A. in the nick of time as they were being investigated by Internal Affairs for some ""wrong doing"" in one of Dormer's cases. Up there, it's not necessarily smooth sailing as Dormer cannot sleep for more reasons than the sun won't go down. As they close in on the killer, mistakes are made, including a fatal one in which the real killer attaches onto.This movie is not perfect, but it's a definite homage to the suspenseful mysteries of the past. Only, this time, it's directed masterfully by one of the greatest directors of all time, Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Memento.) It does have powerful performances, crisp cinematography, daring dialogue and really human characters that make this one of the most believable cat 'n mouse films to watch. SEE IT!"
30,"To me this is easily Nolan's most underappreciated film. Somehow the Hillary Seitz adapted screenplay and Nolan's vision/direction work wonders here in my mind. I've seen the original Norwegian film, and while it is good, I really don't think it's fit to lick the boots of this monster. I think most people have missed the deeper meaning of this version, or they don't let it grab them because it actually is such a scary thing in reality. The consequences of past choices. The way Nolan and his Cinematographer uses dark and light here, and the setting itself also adds extra layers of depth to the film. The original Insomnia uses mostly just light, and in a slightly different way, but both are done effectively. If the subject matter of this reversion, (I don't really consider it a remake, but a reversion.) is fully understood, I really feel that this is a horror film in a very real sense. To let it fully penetrate your consciousness is a challenging and down right horrific thing...and you know why? Every person has crossed the line. Every adult has even defied their own values at some point. Every person has crossed God, or crossed the very lifegiving force of nature if you prefer. At least in some way, all adults have done it, and there is no going back. No one can truly escape this film's deep truth if looked at honestly. To me, this is not only Nolan's most underappreciated film. After Memento only, this is easily in my mind, his best film. Internally startling, but great! 9/10."
31,"The unbearable pressure experienced by a veteran cop during his short stay in ""The Land Of The Midnight Sun"" is charted in detail in Christopher Nolan's impressive remake of the 1997 Norwegian movie called ""Insomnia"". This well-written and very tense drama shows how a toxic combination of guilt, fear and self-doubt torment the detective and undermine his physical and psychological health to such an extent that he soon starts to hallucinate and becomes increasingly unstable.LAPD Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner Detective Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are temporarily transferred to the small town of Nightmute, Alaska to help out with the investigation of a brutal murder that's proving to be very difficult to solve. Dormer's expertise is immediately apparent during his examination of the victim's body, as he picks up on some significant points that were obviously missed by the local police and the previously slow progress of the investigation soon accelerates.Dormer sets a trap for the killer who quickly realises that something's wrong and escapes into the fog behind a remote cabin. After chasing the suspect across some rocks, Dormer sees a figure through the fog and shoots but is then horrified to discover that he's actually killed an innocent man. He later tells his local colleagues that the innocent man had been shot by the murderer and some evidence that he plants supports his story.The local detective that Dormer works most closely with is the young and immensely enthusiastic Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) who, by coincidence, had studied some of his past cases during her time at the police academy. She sees her time with him as an opportunity to observe the way he operates and further enhance her knowledge of police work.The murder victim was a 17-year-old schoolgirl who it's discovered, liked the books of a local crime writer called Walter Finch (Robin Williams) and when it later becomes clear that they were secretly friends, Finch becomes the prime suspect. The dynamic between the determined homicide detective and his prime suspect had already become untypical however, after Finch had contacted him to say that he'd witnessed his crime in the fog and from that point on, the mind games had begun.Will Dormer is under pressure from the time he arrives in Alaska because he knows that his previous cases are being re-examined by Internal Affairs officers who suspect him of tampering with evidence to get convictions and his disloyal partner is willing to betray him to try to save his own career. Being under the constant threat of losing his career, his livelihood and his reputation is a constant worry and when he also has to grapple with his conscience about the man he accidentally killed, his anxiety becomes difficult to bear. The fear of his ""crime"" being discovered (either by information from Finch or by the investigation that Ellie's undertaking) is terrifying and to make matters worse, the perpetual daylight in his new surroundings makes it impossible for him to sleep.Al Pacino does a fantastic job of showing the mental and physical deterioration that his character goes through and Robin Williams, in one of his more restrained performances, is quite chilling as the manipulative and very creepy murderer who claims that he, like Dormer, actually killed as the result of an accident. Hilary Swank is also outstanding in her part as a smart but naïve officer who learns some important lessons and is discouraged by Dormer from making the same mistakes that he made.""Insomnia"" isn't a conventional thriller as the identity of the murderer is revealed at a relatively early stage of the movie and it doesn't contain many action sequences. What ultimately makes it so absorbing, however, is its account of Dormer's torment, his moral ambiguity and the psychological dual that he engages in with Finch."
32,"Christopher Nolan wasn't always directing caped crusaders and dreamworld desperadoes. Once upon a time (nine years ago to be exact) he was at the helm of a criminally underrated crime thriller by the name of Insomnia.Starring Al Pacino as a L.A. detective who travels to a remote Alaskan town to help identify the killer of a teen, this is one of Pacino's most recently truly great performances (a shame, I know). Hilary Swank and Robin Williams co-star as an up-and-coming local policewoman and deranged author (respectively), and both do a superb job of keeping pace with the venerable titan of Tinseltown.What's particularly effective here is the excellent use of setting. In Nightmute (sounds inviting, huh?), because of its far-northern location, the sun doesn't set for long periods of time. This causes Detective Dormer (Pacino) to eventually start falling apart at the seams, as the sun seems to penetrate every effort he makes to lose himself in restful slumber. This naturally ties into a specific subtext that reveals much about Dormer's personality and tainted past as a detective, and it's very refreshing to see the usual them of darkness giving way to light flipped on its head.The problem with writing a review of Insomnia is that I can't detail too much about what unfolds (in terms of plot) without ruining some of the major twists that lend genuine weight to the story as it ambles along some truly dark and disturbing corridors. Don't let the analogy fool you, though; there's nothing slow about the pacing, and it's wholly engrossing from start to finish. The sense of impending slumber is imminent, though, and this heightens the tension in the third act when ""truth"" starts to become a relative term for our exhausted protagonist.Insomnia isn't nearly as stylish as Nolan's most recent offerings, but it's certainly ably directed and its tale is spun with maximum efficiency. If, for one reason or another, this gem that originally shone almost a decade ago has eluded your radar, be sure to check it out.As for myself, it's time to get a little shut-eye."
33,"Insomnia is directed by Christopher Nolan and was released in the year 2002. Walter Finch is the antagonist of the movie and is portrayed by Robin Williams. He is a really calm and cool villain who is always one step ahead of the hero, Will Domer (Al Pacino). Don't trust him by his innocent looks as he is capable of doing much harm that you can't even imagine. Even though Insomnia remains as one of the most underrated works of Nolan till date, Walter Finch is definitely one of the finest villains ever in the movies.Instead of darkness and shadow, the movie takes place in unforgiving, continuous brightness, the 24-hour daylight of a small town in Alaska in the summer months, where a teenage girl has been discovered beaten to death, her body showing signs of ritual killing. A grizzled LA detective is brought in to show the local cops how to take down a villain this scary – a detective who has accepted this godforsaken assignment because he is in trouble with the Internal Affairs department back in the big city. His investigation goes horrifically wrong and his bad conscience, his festering awareness of career mortality and his screwed-up circadian rhythms mean that he is driven slowly mad with sleep deprivation: a kind of fatal familial insomnia of the soul.Only those people who don't suffer from insomnia have the luxury of thinking it's a disturbing metaphor – when the simple physical condition itself is what is truly disturbing. So Al Pacino is inspired casting as the haggard detective Will Dormer, the policeman with the world's most ironic name. Nolan contrives a weirdly Inception dream- like chase between the two men across logs on a freezing river, and also sets up some terrific, Michael Mann-style head-to-head clashes as Dormer tells the creepy writer exactly what he thinks of him. ""You have no motivation,"" snarls Pacino, You're about as mysterious to me as a blocked toilet is to a f*%king plumber!"""
34,"The first 40 min. of this film is goddamn fantastic! Se7en (1995) has been my favourite movie for a LONG time. And for a while, nothing could take it's place. But Insomnia (2002) is even BETTER that Se7en!
The story is about homicide detective Will Dormer (Pacino), and his partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) going to a suburban Alaskan town, to investigate the murder of a 17 year old girl. After meeting with the fresh, young detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), and stopping at a local hotel, they start investigating the corpse. They find out that she had been beaten to death. And that the killer clipped her nails and washed her hair. After a while, they start investigating a cabin in the woods. Then a mysterious man with a raincoat, starts walking to the cabin. After screwing up with a megaphone, The mysterious man gets afraid that he is being tailed and Dormer and a team of the local police, tries to hunt him down. They run inside the cabin and split up. They find out that the man has escaped down to a beach, near his house. Dormer then hunt's him down to the beach. The beach is FILLED with blue fog, making it really hard to see. Dormer meets up with his team, and then one of them gets shot. Dormer then tries to chase down the man, and shoots him. Due to Dormer's limited vision in the fog, he shoots his partner, Hap instead, and the mysterious man gets away. Hap dies and, Dormer tries to cover it up. Kay (the 17 year old girl) was beaten up by her boyfriend (Rick or Ricky). They interrogated Rick for answers but they didn't get any (this is before Dormer shot Hap). There is more to discuss but, I could go on for hours about this film."
35,"When I saw Insomnia the first time I was a bit disappointed.  I have never been the biggest Hitchcock fan and this film seemed to be a page directly out of the Alfred Hitchcock guide book to film making.  It is not as if I hate Hitchcock I just think his techniques have become over used and cliche. I was really excited about this film before viewing because I am such a fan of Christopher Nolan from his work on Following and Memento.The biggest disappointment however was that the film made me tired.  I caught myself dosing off several times during the film.  Upon repeated viewing I realized that this was the brilliance of the film.  Nolan found a way, perhaps accidentally to make the viewer feel the same way as Al Pacino's character.  This is when it ocurred to me Nolan is still the genius he was two films ago.  The story is great, and the acting superb.  Robin Williams pulls off a great take on a mundane psycho, and Hillary Swank as in Boys Don't Cry helps carry the film.  I recommend this to any Hitchcock fan and if you love suspense films and find yourself disappointed the first time, watch it again and you will love it."
36,"I thought this film was going to be one of those grisly slasher movies, but I'm glad I was mistaken!  Pacino is, as usual, on his mark!  In my mind, he's one of the best actors of all time.  This film shows why:Pacino and his LAPD partner, Donovan, are called by one of Pacino's friends to a small-town community in Alaska, where a 17-year-old-girl is murdered. Wasting no time, Pacino goes right to work, possibly wanting to take his mind off the troubles he has back home with his own affairs...The suspects dwindle, and Pacino wastes no time even further dwindling that list, but what he has left is a group of people that any one of them could have done it...or could they?Hillary Swank was the downfall to this film.  From the first time she meets with Pacino, she holds him on a pedestal, even going as far as quoting some of his previous work (even the address of a murder scene in one of his past cases).  It was obvious to everyone what a fan she was of Pacino, but they took it a little too far...Overall, this is an excellent movie!  The scenery was breath-taking (one of those, ""I wish I would have seen it on the big screen"" moments) and the characterization of Robin Williams (who was billed way too high for this film, since he doesn't enter the picture until about half-way through) as a writer was pretty good, also.  In fact, I found myself asking some pretty interesting questions throughout.Pacino fans and Williams fans alike will enjoy this film.  I gave it a somewhat-generous 9 because I lost myself in the film...I could really see something like this happening!"
37,"This is an excellent thriller, if you like to watch real movies. If so, you will be treated to real characters, real story, real drama. I can't add much to the review by Giancarlo, except that I think music could have played a more prominent more, but maybe in this case, 'less is more'. Pacino is excellent, the progression of his character through the movie is so real, you feel what he is going through. The meeting between him an William's is great stuff...""You don't get it. You're my job. You're about as mysterious to me as a block toilet is to a plumber. Reason for doing what you did? Who gives a f...""The supporting cast is excellent, especially Swank showing why she is now such renowned actress (this was after her first Oscar, but before her second) The only odd one is Williams, but it probably my prejudice against him because I grew up watching ever since he was Mork, so bad guy doesn't seem real. Nonetheless, he does it well enough, considering he's working out of his style and up against with two drama pros Pacino and Swank.There's no mystery, because we know who did it early on, the drama lies elsewhere, and it's a really good story.There's a lot of great scenes, just one great scene after another. I can pick up this movie at any point when it's on cable and watch it again. A very underrated movie, if you like drama you will be entertained."
38,"Master director Christopher Nolan has made another excellent movie after his masterpiece ""Memento"" starring Guy Pierce. But ""Insomnia"" is something completely else. The leading roles are for Al Pacino and Robin Williams, who are giving the best of the best performances! Furthermore there is two times Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank. So far the cast, now let's say something about the story, which is truly remarkable. It's brilliantly written and it will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.This is without any doubt the best Pacino-movie of the last few years. Pacino and Williams are an excellent on-screen duo. It's a shame this movie received hardly any awards for the acting performances. This was the second time I watched ""Insomnia"", so I knew the story, but that didn't bother. I still loved it! To conclude I would like to give a quote I loved a lot: ""Life is so important. How could it be so f**king fragile?"" See this movie! You won't regret it! 9/10"
39,"This Nolan film may seem kind of ""easy"" compared to his others if you watch it very vaguely, however it is perfectly written and shown that it can be one of his best.The film's main theme is guilt and escaping from it, and through all the movie we can see that every single thing and detail is trying to give us that clue:First of all, Al Pacino's character can't sleep because being asleep would be the only way to avoid his guilt and be in peace, but since he carries the fear of his previous cases and the A.I. Investigation he can't find that peace to rest.Second, the fact that is never dark on the town and the sunlight is always up again reaffirms that the truth is always out and there's no place there to hide from it, a possible reason why Pacino's character always tries to make his room darker, so he can find a place to hide from the light, the truth.And third, the only reason why he shot his friend on the fog was because it was the only place where he could do it and get away with it, since it was never dark in town and he couldn't sleep, the fog seems like the perfect environment to let his real feelings and desires out and shoot his partner, the only place where he could hide; whether it was conscious or unconscious who knows, but he definitely wanted his friend dead.So this film is a true masterpiece, and every single detail of it may reveal more to it's true meaning."
40,"It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.It seems weird calling Insomnia Christopher Nolan's most underrated movie considering I also think it's his worst film. But saying it's his worst is saying a lot. Insomnia is a brilliant psychological crime thriller that has a lot of the same beats as other police dramas but it definitely has the Nolan flavor along with it. It's about a detective Will Dormer, played by Al Pacino, who is forced to take up a case in Alaska with his partner in order to save his job because of previous mishaps on a case. The case is one of Kay Connel, a fan of Walter Finch's crime novels.As the movie progresses not only does Dormer have trouble sleeping, hence the title, but has to face his inner demons and mistakes he has made that have shaped an inescapable position. Pacino is brilliant in this film and plays well off of Robin Williams, who plays a surprisingly terrifying villain. I think this is another case of the acting in Nolan's films being overlooked. Nolan always creates great material for his actors to work with and puts them in perfect positions, but only one acting academy nomination has ever come from one of his films. I'm not sure Williams or Pacino's performances should have won Oscars but they are definitely under-appreciated.It's hard not to mention Hilary Swank who gives another incredible performance in a movie that she could have easily been overshadowed by two of the all time greats. Insomnia is one of the all time great crime films and I really hope that after Interstellar Nolan moves back into that genre and maybe even brings back Pacino for something. Perhaps something less cerebral than Inception but captures the intensity that Insomnia does, with the incredible characters of The Prestige. Go check out Insomnia and you will be pleased with the outcome.+One of Pacino's last great performances +Intense and thought provoking (as usual with Nolan) +Swank's overlooked performance +Williams creepy villain +Nolan directing a crime film -Ending a bit of letdown compared to other Nolan films 9.3/10"
41,"Perhaps my favourite Alaskan movie, maybe even my favourite Al Pacino movie and surely guaranteed one of Robin Williams best non comedic roles. INSOMNIA! A movie directed by Christopher Nolan is a movie about a mysterious murder that in a remote town in Alaska lacks the resources in law enforcement to solve it so two detectives from Los Angelas are flown in to help solve it. Yeah so its a pretty basic who done it type movie besides the whole Alaska thing.But what I love about this movie is the realism that Christopher Nolan is famous for. Even before he was known for Batman his movies had that amazing look Nolan is famous for.  The cinematography is incredible. Its like a travel brochure for Alaska! Its simply amazing. The story is great. It leaves you in suspense wondering whats going on but in a good way. And not to spoil anything but the reason its called INSOMNIA is its filmed in the part of summer where the sun never sets (sort of the same as the movie 30 days of night). It just adds to the films allure.So if you like great crime movies in the ""Who done it"" genre and you haven't seen this flick? Where have you been!?! Its time to track this movie down and watch it. You will be in awe. Especially if you're a fan of Christopher Nolan's other work or like the actors Al Pacino, Hilary Swank or Robin Williams."
42,I loved Memento. But that doesnt mean I was necessarily going to like Insomnia. The thing you need to expect when you go into Memento is a mind trip. Insomnia is just a murder thriller. The acting is AMAZING! And the film all around was just awesome. See it!
43,"Well-written, superbly acted, beautifully photographed, Christopher Nolan's Insomnia is definitely the best release of 2002 so far!  And for those of you who are afraid to watch because you've seen the original, I promise you will not be disappointed.The screenwriter made appropriate changes to the script that really improved the film.  The dialogue could have been simplistic, but instead was natural and sophisticated.  Most invited were the addition of several unpredictable plot twists as well as an improved ending.Pacino, Williams, and Swank all deliver incredible performances.  Pacino especially, who portrays the conflicted detective so perfectly.  The cinematography only enhances the emotion of the performance by allowing you inside his head, which compliments the nature of the film.Not only a crime mystery, but a psychologically-charged drama, this film is a must see."
44,"** possible minor spoilers ahead **This being my first Christopher Nolan film, I didn't know exactly what to expect with ""Insomnia"". ""Memento"" looked good enough, but a bit too arty to take in along with my film-watching buddy, i.e. my mother. ""Insomnia"", on the other hand, featured two actors good old Mom and I both like -- Al Pacino and Robin Williams -- so it was definitely something we could take in. And boy did we take it in!Christopher Nolan seems to me to be a master of using visuals as a means of advancing the plot line, which is something I've rarely experienced before while watching a movie. This is a good thing. Al Pacino so masterfully played an L.A. detective afflicted with severe insomnia as well as something that weighs down his conscience. This is another good thing. Robin Williams is absolutely delicious as a truly evil and psychotic (as well as scarily intelligent) man, something I'm not used to seeing him portray either in movies or in interviews. This is yet another good thing. Hillary Swank does well what she is supposed to do, which is to fawn over Detective Dormer at the same time that she sharpens her own detective skills. This is yet *another* good thing. In fact, the only complaint I have has been raised before by another reviewer, which is the fact that you don't really realize why Will Dormer is so nervous about IA breathing down his neck until almost toward the end of the movie (in that brilliant scene with Rachel Clement, played by Maura ""damn fine actress"" Tierney).My mother complained at the end of the movie that it went by too slowly for her, and indeed the main activity seems to be rooted in psychological play vs. pure action-driven adrenaline. If you're someone who likes thrillers to be filled with breathless chases down dark corridors and more turning heads than at a tennis match, this is quite possibly not for you. However, you would be missing an excellent film-going experience, as the movie is breathless for more intellectual reasons and everyone in the film gives their all, which rarely occurs with movies anymore.In short: brilliant movie, fantastic mental gymnastics, loved the acting, a bit too slow-paced for certain people, revelation occurs too late (but better late than never!), desperately want to see it again sometime soon."
45,"The only letdown to this movie, if it was even that, was that I expected the murderer's role to be more deranged. He winds up that way, but I expected it from the start based on the commercials I had seen. Overall a very intriguing story which makes you not realize you spent 2 hours in the theater."
46,"Saw this film the other day and enjoyed every minute of it. The three lead performances are fabulous. Al Pacino carries the film with his Oscar worthy performance as a detective suffering from a lot more than lack of sleep. Robin Williams is equally effective as Finch. Like Pacino, Williams restrains himself and by doing so turns in a brilliant nuanced performance. And Hilary Swank takes a role that may seem like it has no ""meat"" and turns it into something special to watch. The rest of the cast do great work as well in small supporting roles most notably Maura Tierney and Jonathan Jackson. The direction by Chris Nolan was well paced and utterly engaging and the cinematography was simply breathtaking. Insomnia should get some Oscar nods especially for Best Actor (Pacino) and Cinematography. I'd give it a 9 since I wanted to see a bit more of Swank and Tierney's characters fleshed out even more. Still it's the best psychological thriller I've seen in a long time."
47,"He looks dead tired and sleepy through-out the whole movie.  and scene after scene he looks as if though he is just ready to collapse on the ground and sleep, but he can't, Will Dormer has Insomnia.  Thus begins another great movie starring Al Pacino.  Though I was skeptical of Williams playing ""a bad guy"" the role seemed to fit him since he wasn't THAT much of a bad guy. And Hilary Swank is the perfect local-rookie cop.  I won't say anymore about this film other than, its definetly worth your 8 bucks to go see."
48,"Today I saw Insomnia and was very impressed. What can one expect when you have Al PAcino and Hilary Swank in great parts, along with Robin Williams in a villains role. All three more than hold their own,especially Al Pacino, who played the role of a police detective who is investigating the murder of a young Alaskan girl while being tormented by his insomnia, brought on by the never ending daylight of summer alaska. The insomnia, which the killer also has, is a major symbolic point, and the movie is laden with them, as well as suspense and psychological tension. Excellently written, beautifully acted, and superbly directed (Christopher Nolan pulls it off again), along with fantastic cinematography proves Insomnia as a thriller to go down in the great movies hall of Fame."
49,"INSOMNIA is not only the third film of acclaimed director Christopher Nolan (his first two were FOLLOWINGS and MEMENTO), but also a film that is able to intertwine the acting talents of three Academy Award winners.  Al Pacino plays a celebrated cop who is asked to work on the case of a murdered girl in Alaska.  Hilary Swank plays the local law enforcement who has her eyes on making a big case.  Robin Williams plays a troubled Alaskan writer.  Without giving anything away, INSOMNIA is definitely worth it.  Some may see it, and be disappointed.  One way to steer away from this failure is think of INSOMNIA as a psychological thriller rather than a ""Shoot 'em up"" thriller. INSOMNIA is story about loyalty and human emotion.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is thrill-packed, but let's just say--You don't need blood and gore to make the audience members be on the edge of their seats (which I was). INSOMNIA hits all of its points including acting, directing, screenwriting, and cinematography.  It's a first class thriller with great characters.  On a side note...Pacino is worthy of an Oscar for his performance, Williams is equally excellent, and Swank also deserves recognition for complete scope of acting.  A job well done by these three actors, and especially the man behind the curtain, Christopher Nolan!"
50,"One doesn't expect to feel claustrophobic in Alaska, but that's exactly the effect when watching ""Insomnia"". The primary story is about the police investigation of the murder of a high-school girl in a small Alaskan town. Through the pull of old acquaintances and political necessity, two LA homicide detectives (Pacino and Martin Donovan) are dispatched to the scene to help the locals. The political necessity concerns a graft investigation in which the two LA detectives are key suspects. One is thinking of copping a plea, so they are spirited out of LA to avoid the investigative light. Then they find themselves in the 24-hour day of the Alaskan summer where the two plot lines collide; the murder investigation and the graft. And what a collision it is. The insomnia of the title is suffered by the Pacino character, who can't sleep during the movie's 7-day span. And each day his eyes are more sunken, he's groggier, less focused. This parallels his descent into guilt, remorse, and desperation. But to provide any more details would be to give away key plot elements. ""Insomnia"" is gripping and it's best to see the movie cold.The acting, especially Robin Williams as the key suspect in the child slaying, is top notch. Williams is made for these roles, he should kiss the suck-up feel-good stuff goodbye for good. The photography is excellent, Alaska never looked so ominous, and the direction delivers the goods. Highly recommended."
51,"As said in my reviews for his masterpiece 'Memento' and the fascinating 'The Prestige', Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'Insomnia' is not one of Nolan's best films, but not his worst. For me it's somewhere in the middle if ranking his films, 'Memento' being his best and, while with a lot of impressive elements, 'Interstellar' being the one that impressed least. It shows fidelity to the Norwegian original, but doesn't go so far that it's a pale retread, in a way that is summed up very well by Roger Ebert.Nolan directs with impeccable style and sense of atmosphere, as well as an ability to tell a potentially convoluted story with clarity without resorting to excess and over-ambition. Much of 'Insomnia' is exceptionally well made, while beautiful Alaska has rarely been more oppressive as well while the cinematography has grit and class. David Julyan's music score is not quite as complex as that for 'Memento', but has a very effective eeriness.The script is tight and thoughtful, and the story, filled with neat twists and turns, is hugely compelling and atmospheric, never being too simple but complex enough to still be understandable and be respectful to the viewer. The cat and mouse stuff could have been predictable and convoluted but executed in masterly hair-raising but also quiet tension.Performances are all strong across the board. While underused somewhat, Martin Donovan and especially Hilary Swank are great here. It is however Al Pacino and Robin Williams who are even better. Pacino gives perhaps his best performance since 'Heat' and he has to me definitely not been on this amount of blistering form as he is in 'Insomnia'. Williams is cast against type, and he plays a genuinely terrifying character with menace but also dignity and restraint.Flaws are only a couple, with the film ending too conveniently and some of the editing being a touch too jumpy.All in all, a gripping film and hardly a sleeper. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
52,"Al Pacino's acting once again is a highlight of a film he's in. He has the capacity to dominate a film with his presence. In this re-make of the Norwegian film, Pacino is excellent as a good-yet-tainted policeman who starts to unravel after not sleeping for four or five days. The Alaskan summer, with light 24 hours of day, can do that to visitorsRobin Williams, meanwhile, plays a killer. It's funny how comedians can do so well playing dramatic roles and Williams is a prime example. He's especially good at creepy nut-cases (See ""One Hour Photo"") Williams doesn't enter the movie until about halfway through and he's fascinating in a low-key role (until the end).For a modern-day crime film, this doesn't have a lot of action but that's fine if the acting is this good and the story involving. Here, the acting is better than the story. Kudos to Hillary Swank, too, for her performance as the cop.The Alaskan scenery ain't bad, either."
53,I used to think that nobody could come close to Robert De Niro when it comes to who was the best actor in Hollywood but as the years went by he started to pick some real Turkeys and a in the mean while an old hand was gradually taking the crown from De Niro and that is Al Pacino. In Insomnia he has picked another cracker of a film that although not fast paced is brilliantly acted and is very watchable. Hilary Swank is superb as is Robin Williams and its refreshing to see him taking a serious role instead of sentimental trash like Patch Adams but as per usual it is Al Pacino who steals the show. He plays an insomniac Cop who gets intangled in a murder case and gets into trouble after accidently killing his partner . I cant think of an actor who looks more tired than Pacino anyway so he was perfect for the role. The story is OK but to be honest the film is more about the performances than the plot. 8 out of 10
54,"First off, Christopher Nolan is one of my biggest influences when it comes to film and screen writing. With films such as Following and Memento, both of which reached cult following levels, he is well on his way to a successful Hollywood career. Then, today came, his 3rd film was released, Insomnia. Based on a 1997 Norwegian film written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjærg, Insomnia is a true work of art in the world of film.Christopher Nolan takes all that was the 1997 film, and brings it to the next level, using his own style of directing, a musical score with shades of Memento, and an all star cast. Al Pacino and Robin Williams pulls out the greatest performances of their careers in the past decade, if not in their ENTIRE careers in my eyes. Pacino once again excels in the role of master dective, while Williams takes this chance to show his ""dark side"", and he does it so well. I can only hope that this is a rebirth of Robin Williams, and as it stands with his upcoming film One Hour Photo (which he once again plays a dark, psychotic role), it seems to be just that! Hilary Swank also pulls out what is the greatest role of her career.Insomnia brings you in as an audience, with it's perfectly woven plot, with a film noir feel to it, just as Nolan's first two films. It is a rollercoster ride of drama and suspense as you watch Al Pacino from the very beginning unravel, and the rest of the story and his past catches up with him. I can not say much more about it, as I do not wish to spoil anything about if for you, but I do want to say this... ...go see it, right now, and enjoy. If you love crime/mystery/drama films with that wonderful Film Noir feel to it, you will love this film. If that isn't your thing, then the performances of the three main actors are worth the price of a ticket in itself. Finally I just want to say, that Insomnia proves once and for all that Christopher Nolan will indeed be a force to reckoned with in Hollywood. I've said it before, and I'll say it again... ...Christopher Nolan is well on his way to becoming the Hollywood legend which he proves he is capable of becoming."
55,"I erred in giving into temptation to watch the original Norwegian ""Insomnia"" on IFC just a couple of weeks before seeing this Hollywood re-make directed by indie-credible ""Memento"" Christopher Nolan with a very effective Academy Award-winning cast.The original movie had a tiny budget and also an excellent cast, led by the terrific Swede Stellan Skarsgård, growing as pale as that relentless sunshine during the course of the film; the usually haggard-looking Al Pacino interprets his insomnia visually through an ever more haggard face.Though the original film isn't given as the source material until well into the closing credits, this follows the main thrust of the story closely. The changes, though, are both subtle and significant and intriguingly as American as Sam Spade when the mise en scene gets moved to Alaska (actually shot in Vancouver). Significantly, there is less sex and more morality.Hilary Swank's character is more naive than her counterpart; Martin Donovan's character's role is more central to the story and, of course, Robin Williams gets more screen time than his original counterpart, as the conflict is less in the lead's mind and more on the screen as a duel. The plot twists are done differently so I shamefully got confused between the two movies.While not as overwhelming as the original, I do think this version should rank right up with the great detective/cop-does-the-right-thing movies, and the plot makes more sense than ""The Big Sleep.""(originally written 6/16/2002)"
56,"Having a crazy screenplay; Insomnia is thrilling, shocking and appealing supported with strong performances."
57,"LAPD homicide detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are brought to the small town of Nightmute, Alaska to help with the investigation of the murder of 17 year old Kay Connell. The partners are facing an investigation by IA back home. Local cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) is a big fan of Dormer. The police sets a trap. Dormer accidentally kills Eckhart in the fog and he works to hide his mistake. Dormer has insomnia from the perpetual daylight and his guilt. Kay was a fan of crime writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams).Director Christopher Nolan kept the moodiness of the Norwegian original and added some compelling tension. Al Pacino and Robin Williams are terrific. It holds up to the original without tearing it down."
58,"FILM: 8.5/10.I recently rewatched the 2002 film Insomnia, and it's still a gripping and compelling experience. From the very beginning, the performances draw you in, and they are an absolute joy to watch. Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank are all in top form, each player contributing equally to the film's success.Al Pacino's portrayal is a testament to his talent. He never digresses into overacting as he has in the past; instead, he plays his role with a subtle intensity that builds anticipation. His character is plagued by insomnia, which adds another layer of complexity to his performance. Pacino expertly captures the fatigue, frustration, and moral conflicts his character goes through.Robin Williams, known for his comedic roles, surprises us with a dark and disturbing character in this film. He's like a ticking time-bomb of undistilled rage and mounting frustration, just waiting to explode. Yet, for the majority of his screen time, Williams displays an almost creepy sense of control that sends chills down your spine. It's definitely one of the darkest and most poignantly disturbing roles he's ever done.The film weaves murder, mystery, and psychological tension together seamlessly, creating an enthralling narrative. Director Christopher Nolan, known for his ability to create mood, does a masterful job in Insomnia. The atmospheric cinematography by Wally Pfister and the hauntingly beautiful setting of Alaska enhance the sense of unease and isolation felt by the characters.The pacing is well-executed, keeping the tension high throughout. Every twist and turn in the plot is executed with precision, leaving you guessing until the very end. The psychological cat-and-mouse game between Pacino and Williams keeps you invested in their complex relationship.Overall, my rewatch of Insomnia was a great experience. The performances, the mix of murder, mystery, and psychological tension, and Nolan's masterful direction all contribute to its success. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, and I highly recommend giving it a watch.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 8/10.1080p presentation, Detail level: Good, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Good, Master condition: GoodAUDIO: 9/10.DTS HD-MA 5.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Good, LFE content: GoodMOOFIEMETER: 8/10."
59,"""Insomnia"" is a film directed by Christopher Nolan. It stars Al Pacino and Robin Williams. Both actors (especially Pacino) had a strong tendency to overact and I attribute the more subtle performances to Nolan's direction. It also was originally a Norwegian film (1997) and unfortunately I have not yet seen this original picture.Detective Will Dormer (Pacino) and his partner are sent from Los Angeles to Alaska to help the locals work on a murder case in a small village. When Will is able to figure out where the killer (Williams) is, the apprehension goes south VERY quickly. When the surround the suspects home, it's very foggy...and the creep is able to sneak away because of the fog. In the process, there's a shootout and in the confusion and weather conditions, the creep escapes AND Will accidentally shoots his partner.Instead of letting folks know of the accident, Will stages it so that everyone else will think that the perp killed the detective...and Will plans on just blaming it on him. But unfortunately, Walter DID see what Will did...and soon he begins phoning Will and lets him know what he knows. Soon Walter is blackmailing Will and now solving this murder is VERY complicated and difficult, because if he does bring in this killer, Walter is sure to tell everyone what he knows about Will's shooting.As I mentioned above, the performances by the two leads are very restrained...and I really appreciated it. Combined with good overall direction and nice location shots (most in British Columbia, not Alaska), I highly recommend the film. And, although it is a remake, I still think it's a heck of a film."
60,"Insomnia, released in 2002, offers a captivating experience as a thriller film. The movie stands out through its storytelling, character depth, and cinematographic techniques.Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film features outstanding performances from notable actors like Al Pacino and Robin Williams. The story revolves around police detective Will Dormer (Pacino), who finds himself entangled in a complex situation while attempting to solve a murder case in Alaska. Dormer's moral conflicts and internal struggles highlight the depth and vulnerabilities of his character.Nolan's storytelling technique adds an air of mystery and tension to the film. The contrasting dark atmosphere and the perpetual daylight of Alaska symbolically reflect Dormer's sleeplessness and mental breakdown. This captivating visual narrative draws the audience into the heart of the story.The internal traits and development of the characters enrich the film. Dormer's push to bend ethical boundaries to catch the culprit and his psychological battle against the perpetrator's mind games are among the film's compelling aspects. Additionally, the character of Dormer's partner in Alaska, Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), adds depth to the story.Cinematographic techniques are employed to emphasize the characters' inner worlds. Close-up shots and visual symbols effectively convey the emotional states of the characters. Moreover, the natural beauty of Alaska creates a sense of immersion, making the audience feel like a part of the setting.In conclusion, Insomnia is a thriller film that shines through its engaging storytelling, character depth, and impressive cinematography. Christopher Nolan's directorial skills and the actors' performances make the film worth watching. ""Insomnia"" invites viewers to embark on a journey intertwined with character complexities and psychological conflicts, offering an unforgettable experience for thriller enthusiasts."
61,"I was having trouble getting to sleep the other night and this came up on cable, I may have missed the first couple of minutes but I think I got the gist as it went along. Al and his homicide squad partner come up from LA (where their unit is under investigation) and assist Alaskan police on a murder case in mid-summer. Al never quite adjusts to the 24 hour sunlight but that's only one of his many issues. Swank does really well as the local smart, hard-working and appreciative help. Al gives a nice textured performance, everyone sort of has shades of this or that in this movie, as things progress we learn a little more about the characters and what led to the murder. At points Al's eccentric behavior may test credibility but the story moved along well, this is a serviceable cop drama."
62,"Following up a movie like Memento must be quite a chore, but Christopher Nolan did his best. Insomnia is more of a focus on photographic technicalities, allowing the more mainstream viewer to experience Nolan's dark and cryptic style of focusing and cutting. But then again, Insomnia isn't just about cinematography, it's about the nature of human beings and their passion for the truth. Al Pacino portrays the troubled cop Will Dormer to a hilt, letting his natural wrinkles and facial expressions become a natural prosthetic. While the dialogue was simple and direct, the entire history of the characters could be told in the first few minutes of the film. Hillary Swank and Robin Williams' characters had very little history or motive, but then again, their stories are not as important as Dormer's. However, such a miscue in storytelling leaves a hollowness to the picture, turning everyone into a fickle backdrop for Dormer's troubles. Overall, the story was well put together, and executed by the numbers. While David Julyan's score was good, he should have sought to stay confined within his bounds as he did with Memento and Following. 8/10"
63,"Here's another great work by the masterful auteur that is Christopher Nolan. Insomnia is about two cops who go to a small town in Alaska to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. While chasing a suspect officer Will Dormer (Al Pacino) accidentally shoots and kills his partner Hap (Martin Donavan). Distraught at what this could do to his already dwindling reputation, which is explained in some very important back story, Dormer lies about the accident and tells everybody that it was the man they were chasing that shot Hap. This event leads to a dark series of twists and turns that go deep into the psychological nature of an emotionally provoked cop and a psychopathic killer.Insomnia is a very dark film, yet only in figurative terms. The film is never physically dark and this is for an extremely important reason that is also where the title of the film stems from. It takes place in an Alaskan town far up north and in many places like that it never gets dark for certain periods of the year. Dormer, a cop from Los Angeles, is investigating this murder during one of those periods. Because of the complete lack of darkness Dormer develops sleep problems and is hit hard by insomnia. It is this that spurs on a thrilling chain of events that lead up to an incredible climax that comes very unexpectedly. This setting creates for a compelling juxtaposition of psychological themes that branch out towards the sleep depraved nether regions of the human mind, to the dark and twisted mind of an unconventional killer, who Robin Williams portrays with absolute disturbing perfection. Robin Williams, despite being as hilarious as he is, always amazes in his more serious roles and Insomnia is a fantastic exposè of his dramatic talent.Dark and brooding films are not something that are far and few between in this day and age of cynicism, yet Insomnia is able to stand out as one of the better portrayals of the dark side of the human mind. And not only is Insomnia a good example of a dark thriller, it is just an all around well made film. Pacino and Williams are incredible together and their counteracting roles balance each other out in such an immaculate and harrowing way. They are both given a fantastic script to work off of that weaves a captivating story that will leave you thinking, while also entertained. And of course it is a Christopher Nolan film so the stylistic direction is of course great. The jumpy and claustrophobic way in which it is shot provides a fuller experience of the psychological thriller story. Nolan keeps the technical grandeur toned down greatly for this picture, but his visual stamp is still there.My only real complaint with this film is that it is not as big as what you would expect from a Nolan film. It is much smaller in scale and doesn't blow your mind out of proportion like his other films do. However, this is hardly a legitimate complaint because an individual movies quality should not be compared alongside another. Each film is its own and should be critiqued as such. Thus saying that Insomnia lacks the pizzaz of other Nolan films is not so much a criticism so much as a personal observation.Insomnia is a great addition to the psychological thriller genre. Its a great story that keeps you wanting more and Pacino and Williams absolutely amaze. Don't expect anything huge but definitely check this one out for visual and psychological aesthetic."
64,"This films biggest achievement is the acting. Robin Williams and Al Pacino are very memorizing in there roles as there characters. Everything seems so real and that really keeps the film going. The scenery is also beautiful to look at, every shot is done with such care and precision. The fact that it was a good reboot is also quite impressive. The film captures the intensity of insomnia in a very intense situation and works very well. Overall, I think this film is very underrated. I feel like people don't talk enough about that film and they should be. Insomnia is highly intense and is very rewatchable. It keeps you on the edge of your seat through the entire runtime."
65,"Insomnia was a solid drama, very suspenseful and well-acted. Kudos to Robin Williams for once again leaving his silliness behind and showing the world that he can truly act. As usual, it took but a minute to forget that Pacino was even acting; he literally becomes every role he's in. His insomnia was contagious; I started getting weary just feeling what he was going through.This is the first time I've seen Swank, and she was good but perhaps this is not the role that will convince me that she deserved her Academy Award.  (It was a Jodie Foster type role and I couldn't help but compare.)  Great cinematography, superb casting all the way around, wonderful story-telling.  I'd give it an 8 out of 10."
66,"Some days ago Woody Allen came to Spain to receive the prestigious Príncipe de Asturias Award, and he had time to express his personal opinion about Hollywood today. His recent film Hollywood Ending is a clear critic of what Hollywood has become. I have to say that I agree with him. Films are more and more expensive, but the results are worse and worse. It seems like there are no good writers yet, and films like The Red Dragon (which I saw today in its Spanish première) are -in my modest opinion, of course- a demonstration on how empty of ideas a film can be. But Insomnia is an exception among dozens of low quality films. It has a really good screenplay, with very good original ideas, and, also, the printed result is great. Al Pacino is splendid (does he overact a bit or is it just my imagination? Maybe it's only my imagination). Robin Williams is correct, he does his role well (it's his second bad guy role in just a few months) and the rest of the cast are also quite good. The opening scene is simply captivating. And the edition of the whole film is wonderful. It's a pleasure to see the first minutes of Pacino's scenes, full of short shots perfectly combined with plenty of subtle details. I enjoyed the whole film since it began until it ended. Nice story, perfect screenplay, solid acting, good music, wonderful cinematography and editing and good directing. A really good film. One of the best this year. 8-9 out of 10."
67,"Will was a veteran detective. Although he succeeded on several cases, he would be faced with the accusation of wrongdoing. When he and his partner were sent to assist solving a murder case happened in Alaska, the investigation on him was still going on. His partner was a key witness on his own case. He tried to persuade his partner to give up, but failed. More head aching, he killed mistakenly his partner in an operation of hunting the killer. He covered the truth. His agony just began.Sometimes we make a mistake, and then we conceal it. It turns out to lead to bigger mistake because you have to make continually mistakes to prevent the exposure of truth. The price usually is huge.Al Pacino wonderfully played a sympathizing detective. He should have won a nominee for the academy award at least.An excellent thriller. 8/10"
68,"(Flash Review)Pacino nails a great character study of an experienced detective on the verge of losing his reputation, integrity and mind. His character also finds himself in a game of outwitting the suspect he is attempting to capture played very well by Robin Williams. In perusing Williams, Pacino makes a couple decisions that Williams takes advantage of partially due to Pacino's lack of sleep during the endless light in Alaska of Summer. Will Pacino nab him in the end or let him slip through his fingers to protect himself from his bad decisions? This was a solid mystery/thriller with great acting and a nicely packaged story."
69,"Al Pacino stars as a Los Angeles homicide detective sent along with is partner Martin Donovan to the small town of Nightmute, Alaska to help with the investigation of a brutal homicide. They have partly been sent because local police chief Paul Dooley is a retired LA cop, but also because Internal Affairs has been investigating them and their boss wants them out of town. Donovan reveals to Pacino that he's been considering cooperating, a move that would ruin Pacino. While tracking down the murderer, a brutal accident puts Pacino in the hot seat. He tries to cover up his involvement, while suffering from insomnia due to the 24 hour daylight in this part of the world. Local rookie cop Hilary Swank, a great admirer of Pacino's, starts to realize something is wrong ... and the murderer (Robin Williams) himself contacts Pacino, revealing he knows what really happened and that he can help them both. This seems to be the least talked about of Nolan's films, which is a shame because it's a sharp and interesting remake of the 1997 Norwegian film that starred Stellan Skarsgard in Pacino's role. It's not a carbon copy of the original film, going different places with the same material. It's also one of the last really strong performances we got from Pacino."
70,"Insomnia is an original, surprising thriller about the thin line between good or bad, about the defensive instincts patronizing each one of us in desperate times, about the numbing effect of regret and guilt and the detours our mind drives us on in our search for the right path.
Maybe not the best of Nolan, but it still has some unexpected turning points, original and intense scenes, not to speak about the excellent cast. Good movie overall."
71,"We all know that it's our real or perceived weaknesses, mistakes and transgressions that keep us awake at night; left to themselves they can run riot. Unable to rest, we lose perspective, our memory plays tricks on us and guilt - justified or not - can become overwhelming. Soon we're caught in a circular trap, from which we can only be freed by sleep or the morning.It's precisely this insomnia that haunt's Nolan's third film; Dormer (Pacino) is haunted throughout by an assortment of vulnerabilities. Some of these are a simple fact of the passage of time and humanity - the threat of a turned ankle after a jump, slipping under the logs giving chase, an inability to sleep in bright light. Others are real guilt, an increasing doubt of his own motives, or the temptations of being away from home and whatever his more 'normal' family life might be. This is all given force by the parallelisms between Dormer and Robin Williams's character, and the Internal Affairs investigation with the central murder.These are all strengths of a script that, unusually for a Nolan film, isn't written by the director. I haven't seen the film it's a remake of, but certainly it's a film that unlike many of Nolan's other films (which he at least co-writes), its main female characters are complex, interesting creations with genuine agency. Photographed by long-term collaborator Wally Pfister, the film is soaked in cold, almost metallic shades (amongst others) of blue, lending a sense of the eerie to a film which, driven by a Pacino performance that for the most part avoids his latter-day tendency to self-parody, brilliantly evokes the way an inability to sleep feels all the day round. Unlike many Nolan films, the story is entirely linear; but it retains his obsessions with how our past informs our present, and the film plays with that as the flashes of visons that haunt that Dormer suggests a suppression of his past that threatens to overwhelm in - and by the end, does.This is often seen as a minor Nolan film, on the way to the more successful and lauded films that lay in his future. But it deserves attention for all these reasons, not to mention the much missed Robin Williams's haunting and controlled performance. If Inception would take the cinema of dreams to somewhere new, this asks uncomfortable questions about what makes us unable to sleep ... and therefore to also dream. Showcasing as it does a deft thriller plot, his customary technical excellence and female characters who are better drawn than his usual, this is a corner of the Nolan filmography ripe for a revisiting."
72,"InsomniaWhen you have insomnia, you finally get the chance to finish listening to those tranquil noise CDs that you always fall asleep during.Unfortunately, the restless detective in this thriller doesn't have time to listen to humpback whales in the rain forest.While under investigation for shooting his partner, LAPD detective Dormer (Al Pacino) travels to the land of the midnight sun to find the killer of a 17-year-old girl.Partnered with a green officer (Hilary Swank), Dormer is drawn towards a local writer (Robin Williams), whose work was found near the body.Meanwhile, Dormer cannot sleep – thanks to perpetual daylight and guilt over his partner's death.With strong performances and masterful direction at the hand of Inception creator Christopher Nolan, this melancholy and maddening remake of a Norwegian film is an intense and intelligent contribution to the thriller genre.The cure for sleeplessness, mind you, is to mainline tryptophan.

73,"A few weeks ago my mom and I were watching Insomnia on TV when it was storming out and right as the conclusion was about to happen, the power went out! Don't you hate it when that happens? So I just had to rent this movie and finish it, I just watched it this morning and I have to say that Insomnia was a very clever thriller, almost on the edge of Hitchcock. The plot was so very interesting and also makes you question your own ethics on what is right and what is wrong. It's rare that a movie really does have that kind of effect on you, where you almost wonder if it would be so bad if someone got away with something so terrible. The actors in this film were absolutely terrific in their performances, especially Robin Williams who has proved to many that he can act brilliantly in a drama and now in the thrillers. Insomnia is a clever thriller that I was very impressed with.Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart are two detectives from L.A. who are coming to Alaska to investigate a the fatal beating of a 17 year old girl, Kay. Dormer meets another cop who admires his work, Ellie Burr. Together along with other policemen they find the killer, but he gets away. In the middle of trying to find the killer in the deep woods in the thickest fog, Will accidentally shoots Hap thinking he's the killer. But scared, Will tells everyone it was the killer that shot him, but then Will gets a phone call from the killer and he knows about Hap. Now Will has a chance to get off scott free along with the killer, but it's a question of him being able to live with this horrible secret while someone who's innocent goes to jail for the killer's crime.Insomnia is a great thriller, I was incredibly pleased with how well it worked. Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, and Robin Willaims all did a terrific job of acting, they really clicked and made the film work. I think one of the scenes that really got to me was Dormer explaining to Rachel about his ways in L.A., what he was ""escaping"" from, you'll have to see what I mean. But Pacino does a grade A job of acting in that scene, he made it so effective to where you would question on what you would do in a tough situation. I would highly recommend Insomnia, it's a terrific film, just don't watch it in the middle of a bad storm, the ending might get cut off, lol.8/10"
74,"A veteran detective with skeletons in his closet, whisked away to a foreign land (for whatever reason) - it's been done many times. Most of the time, the ""is he dirty or isn't he?"" routine is frustrating (""Black Rain"", ""Boom Town"", ""Rising Sun"", etc.). BUt it's different with ""Insomnia""; you pretty much know the main character is a dirty cop, so it's really about the walls closing in, which is actually refreshing. And it adds levels.Other than that, it's the talent of the main cast that makes this fresh. Pacino, Swank and Williams are all terrific (although Williams is perfectly at home with quietly deranged; it's beyond creepy). And Pacino is well-suited for a guy who can't get any sleep. He makes run-down look easy.7/10"
75,"There is a scene in the original Insomnia where the protagonist (there played by Stellan Skarsgard, in this remake by Al Pacino), desperate to obtain a damaged bullet to tamper with the evidence of an ongoing investigation, approaches a dog in a dark alley and kills it. The remake mimics the scene, except the dog shot by Pacino is dead already. In a nutshell, this shows the difference between the two movies.Before this sounds like some kind of anti-remake crusade, I'll say Nolan's movie surpasses the Norwegian original from many points of view.Performances are stronger, led by a nicely low-key turn by Pacino, who reminds us what a great thespian he can be when he isn't hamming it up. The character of the killer is more developed, here aptly played by Robin Williams in one of those creepy clear-eyed, smug-faced turns of his. Dialogues are crisp without getting too cozy, cinematography makes an interesting use of colors and light.So, where does this thriller - focused on two veteran Homicide detectives searching for a killer in Alaska - goes wrong? It erases most of the moral ambiguity of the original. Skarsgard's dark protagonist was genuinely unsettling - a lost man who quickly sinks to ignominious lows to cover up his own mistakes. Here, Pacino is flawed in a much safer and more traditional way. The extent this remake goes to soften his main character into something more palatable to a mass audience is actually rather amusing in a meta kind of way.The greatest betrayal, though, is the ending, with the martyred hero redeemed by his own blood who passes the torch to Swank's young idealistic cop with a smile and a moral lesson. From the director of the dangerous and abrasive Memento, it's a real shame.7,5/10"
76,"Who doesn't love Al Pacino? Anyone.....Come on..... there at least should be one hater! Guess there is not. Al Pacino is loved by everyone who has seen him as ""Michael Vito Corleone"" in The Godfather Trilogy or the ruthless ""Tony Montana"" in Scarface. These films were the highlights of his career and even though he isn't as memorable as Will Dormer in Insomnia, it is hard not to give him an honorable mention. Insomnia is referred to as a ""Cat and Mouse"" thriller and it proved that it is one because of the whole chase thing between Will Dormer, a cop, and a local writer who goes by the name of Walter Finch, a man who is under the suspicion of killing a teen. This is proved even more when there is an actual ground chase between them two on the logs in the flowing river. That scene was full of heart pounding action and added a bit of intrigue that made you appreciate the film a little bit more. The film would have been unknown to me if there weren't the three Oscar winners, Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank that made this thriller for what it is, also if Christopher Nolan hadn't directed it. He is truly a great director. Steven Spielberg has to watch out for the might of Nolan. Al Pacino was absolute and admirable in Insomnia therefore making him the best actor in the whole film. His role as a tough cop was fascinating and hypnotizing. Robin Williams, who portrays Walter Finch, was not as great as Al's however he still doesn't disappoint. This is not Robin Williams best role but it MIGHT be his most evilest role in his ""Evil Trilogy"". Hilary Swank's character Ellie Burr made you think that she was unnecessary but as the film reaches its climax you realize that she plays an important part. Swank's performance could not rival against her other roles in ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Boy's don't Cry"" however she is agreeable but not fun to watch. The films chilly, or spooky, atmosphere is the best in any movie, I have ever seen so far. It just makes the films setting really home-sweet-home. The scenery at the beginning was beautiful as the plane flew over the ice and glaciers of Alaska.In Nightmute, Alaska, seventeen year old resident Kay Connell is found murdered. As a favor to the local Nightmute police chief, two Los Angeles Robbery Homicide police detectives, Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart, are called in to assist in the investigation. Although renowned in the police world, both Dormer and Eckhart are facing some professional issues back in Los Angeles. In Nightmute, Dormer has a major case of insomnia due to a combination of the incessant midnight sun and from a secret he is carrying. This insomnia is causing him to be delusional. Something he is not dreaming about is that the murderer has contacted him, informing him all about the murder and the fact that he knows everything that is going on with Dormer. They begin a symbiotic relationship in keeping secrets for each individual's benefit. But ambitious young local detective, Ellie Burr, might piece the story together on her own."
77,"As is evident by now, anyone who has enjoyed Christopher Nolan's movies would, most probably, Insomnia at the bottom of their favorite from Nolan. While people who don't enjoy the Nolan brand of cinema will mark Insomnia as their favorite from Nolan. Simply because, this movie is a remake and while has many of Nolan's signature styles, it is not as evident as it is in his other superior works (IMHO).Nolan's movies (from Following to Inception) is built around the concept of duality. Insomnia has a similar theme running through it, that of Al Pacino's character living the life of a honest role-model while still doing things reprehensible, thus showing two sides of life. Al Pacino and Robin Williams are in supreme form and the cinematography by Wally Pfister is gorgeous. But the 'quickness' that is associated with other Nolan movies (even BB) is visibly absent in this one. It is by no means a bad movie, but the slow burn of the thriller does dampen the effect. Not a must watch, but an intriguing thriller that well matches its Swedish inspiration."
78,"""Insomnia"" is a thriller that has some big names attached to it: Al Pacino, Robin Williams & Hilary Swank; all designated as 'Academy Award Winner' on the movie poster. Director Christopher Nolan is also well-known, though his only Oscar nomination is for a co-screen writing credit.The story concerns a veteran cop (Al Pacino) sent to Alaska along with his partner in order to aid in a murder investigation. Through a series of events cop & killer (Robin Williams) eventually come face to face, though under circumstances that pit them against each other in a battle of wits.The cast, as previously noted, is stocked with Oscar-caliber talent. However, it seems to me that those casting the film went for big name actors over others who may have been better suited to the parts. I have no complaints about Al Pacino as he's played this sort of character enough times to be able to do it in his sleep. On the other hand, Robin Williams just didn't convince me as a murderer in the usual Hollywood 'criminal mastermind' mold. Hilary Swank was decent enough but her role demanded none of the skill that won her two well-deserved Oscars. The movie makers should have skipped Swank's price tag and spent the money on better support because most of it is merely television-caliber.The script is a pretty good one if you like thrillers of this sort, although it's been done to death by now. Nolan's direction throws in some admittedly breathtaking outdoor scenery while the more intimate scenes are no better than average. The score by David Julyan is decent enough but I can't really recall anything particularly interesting or memorable about it.On the whole, the film is a perfectly acceptable thriller though it falls into the trap of placing more emphasis on stars than story. However, I expect that fans of the genre will not find it difficult to overlook the supposed faults that I've outlined."
79,"The film Insomnia, based on an earlier Norwegian film, is an almost winner.By acclaimed directed Christopher Nolan, (Memento,) this is a bet that almost, but not quite, pays off, in the sense of waiting for the ""other shoe to drop."" It is not so much a murder mystery as it is a character study, but, as with the rest of the film, it's almost but not quite that, also.Al Pacino is Detective Will Dormer, who has been summoned to Nightmute, Alaska by an old friend to help solve the murder of a 17-year-old girl. Pacino is a man on the verge of many things: retirement, age, and moral collapse, as we learn early on. He and his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are being investigated by Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles. On the way to Alaska, Hap informs Dormer that he intends to ""cut a deal"" and take whatever comes of it. This doesn't please Dormer in the slightest, and he gives the impression he'll fight the investigation, and his partner's selling-out, but fate has a different idea. Early in the investigation, Dormer accidentally shoots Hap. With his partner now dead, Dormer has nothing more to fear from IA. Or so he imagines.Enter Walter Finch, played by Robin Williams; he is the main suspect in the murder, and has also seen the shooting of Hap, or so he informs Dormer. Now the plot will weave around these two, almost exclusively, as they play their game of manipulation and one-upmanship. And here's where the film begins to lose its own compass.First, I had a bit of a problem with the fact that the two detectives from L.A. were in Alaska to begin with. Supposedly, this is an official trip, but I have trouble believing that the Los Angeles Police Dept would send two of its people to Alaska for such a mundane reason. Yes, it's murder, but the ease with which these two solve the case and pinpoint the murderer is just so fast that it's hard to believe the Alaskans couldn't have done the same, and done it sooner. Second, the character of Ellie Burr, (Hilary Swank) who has made a study of Detective Dormer's work for her academy thesis, is just a little too worshipful. And what a coincidence that she should be there in Nightmute, involved in this case. It's a little too contrived, in my opinion. Hilary Swank, a wonderful actress, is overqualified for the wide-eyed wonderment she portrays here. There's not enough depth in her character to hold your interest.Third, we never really get a chance to pick apart Finch, Robin Williams' character. We only know a little about him, but nothing essential, and nothing that adds to our understanding of why he committed this foul deed in the first place, or what is driving him to do what he does. We come into this situation, ""in the middle"" and leave it pretty much the same way when the movie ends. There's a solution, but no enlightenment.
There are two other interesting characters that also tease us into wanting to know more, but never give up any information beyond that: the hotel desk clerk, played by Maura Tierney, and Police Chief Nyback, played by Paul Dooley, are both characters I would have liked to see developed into ""whole"" people. Especially Tierney's character, who says one of the most fascinating lines in the film, something about how people in Alaska are either born there or are there because they've escaped something a lot worse. With a lead-in like that, it was a shame not to follow up on it.Mostly, we are treated (?) to extreme closeups of Pacino as he spirals down into his insomniac, ethical black-hole, and teasers of the menace Robin Williams might actually be hiding underneath that parka. In neither case is it enough, or satisfying, and as the film winds down into its inevitable conclusion, we are left with a hollow feeling that we just didn't get enough. We can draw conclusions, but they are not the point; the point is what makes these things happen in the first place, and that's a question that goes unanswered. Additionally, there are some recurring cut-scenes of the murder itself, which are never explained or illuminated. They appear as memory flashes, but we never see them in their entirety, which is extremely annoying. Overall, the film looked as if it were originally a lot longer, and was edited down to fit its current time. If that's not the case, then it's just too minimalist to make a satisfying story. The plot is, or could be, a very good one, with a bit more explanation. There is a lot of atmospheric buildup, but in the end, not much suspense or tension for the viewer. The characters tease us with development, never quite making us understand them, or their motives; they feel thinly painted, and shadowy. Not a tour-de-force for director Nolan, though Pacino and Williams give their parts all the nuances they can.I left wanting more."
80,"Will Dormer is a veteran LA detective, recognized for his investigative skills, noted by his peers as a good cop.I was expecting a typical detective story with lots of puzzles and thrilling mysteries, hoping to see why Will Dormer is acclaimed for his job. But this is not really the focal point of the story. Just around 25 minutes in the movie, you'll already see a major lead about the suspect.While I understand that the story begins after the foggy beach chase, I was left wanting for more build up and mystery in the investigation. It really felt rushed.The first encounter with Walter Finch at the rocky beach put me in the edge of my seat. It's a pretty good cat and mouse chase but the real surprise is the accidental shooting of Hap that really sent me in shock.I'm not really a fan of the ending. I think it's predictable and too safe for an interesting lead character. And Ellie Burr, towards the end of the film, suddenly became too soft for Will that she tried to cover up the truth for him.Insomnia is a character-driven, psychological thriller. It explores the character's moral judgement on how they will navigate their way through difficult choices where their principles are at stake.Robin Williams as Walter Finch doesn't appeal to me that much but I love every bit of Al Pacino's acting as Will Dormer. Those sleep-deprived eyes, hunchback posture, and piercing stares look so authentic you can feel his weariness. Overall, it's a decent film but I'm not obsessed with it."
81,"Riveting and interesting thriller with brilliant performances. Two Los Angeles homicide detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are dispatched to a northern town where the sun doesn't set to investigate the methodical murder of a local teen. To Ellie (Hilary Swank) the rookie assigned to assist the detective Dormer's a hero. But she doesn't knows Dorner is investigated by Internal Affairs. Poor Dormer,however, he's really disoriented in every scene, no longer distinguishes so clearly between means and motive, cause and effect. He who sins, does not sleep ! .Days never end. Nightmares are real. No one is innocent. Don't close your eyes. A tough cop. A brilliant killer. An unspeakable crime. A murder investigator has been brought in on a special case, sleep deprived, he makes a horrible mistake which is discovered by the killer he has been hunting !.This taut psychological thriller contains intrigue, action, shootouts , suspense, twists and turns. If all this may sound familiar, it's because Hillary Seitz's subtle script improves on the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name: Insomnia by Erik Skjoldbjærg with Stellan Skarsgård, Sverre Anker Ousdal, Gisken Armand. Concerning a twisted premise: when a killing takes place and covers it up, a double sided game of cat-and-mouse ensues. Despite its linear script, the movie is very recognisable the work of the sharp, probing intelligence that gave ¨Following¨ and ¨Memento¨. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the unconventional progression of the storyline and the various twists within the script. While it succeeds as an extremely stylish, gripping thriller, it's also another of the director's takes on life as narrative. Uniformly excellent performance especially from Al Pacino and Robin Williams , lends welcome nuance and depth to the ethical investigation while furnishing the drama with dark, telling ironies and intriguing ambiguity. There are few actors as Pacino who can keep a straight face, yet still manage to convey complex emotion, and he is one of them. He walked through his scenes with somberness and really powerful, yet weary. Pacino and Williams are well accompanied by a magnificent support cast, such as: Hilary Swank, Paul Dooley, Nicky Katt, Maura Tierney, Jonathan Jackson, Katharine Isabelle Larry Holden, Jay Brazeau, Lorne Cardinal, Ian Tracey, among others.It displays thrilling and suspenseful musical score by David Julyan . As well as cloudy and evocative cinematography by Wally Pfister , Nolan's regular, shot on several locations in Britannia Beach, Columbia Británica, Canadá, Port Alberni, Columbia Británica, Canadá, Hyder, Valdez, Alaska . The motion picture was perfectly written and directed by innovator director Christopher Nolan, author of various masterpieces: ¨ Insomnia¨, ¨Memento¨ , ¨The Prestige¨ , ¨Batman begins¨, ¨The Dark Knight¨ , ¨The Dark Knight Rises¨, ¨Dunkirk¨, among others . Rating : Above average 7.5/10 , it was throughly entertaining and exciting, and no as predictable as you would think . The film results to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work , it's highly recommended and keep you guessing until final. Christopher Nolan, the man who created the equally impressive thriller Memento, directs efficientlly this American remake of the Norwegian film. Innovator director Christopher Nolan, author of various masterpieces: ¨ Insomnia¨, ¨Memento¨ , ¨The Prestige¨ , ¨Batman begins¨, ¨The Dark Knight¨ , ¨The Dark Knight Rises¨, ¨Dunkirk¨, among others .

82,"Although I don't think this is one of Christopher Nolan's strongest films, but it was still pretty good and had a good story which is what his films are mostly known for. One of the quotes from the movie is ""a good cop can't sleep because a piece of the puzzle is missing and a bad cop can't sleep cause his conscience won't let him"". And that is what the story is about while getting blackmailed by the killer who tries to convince the detective that they are both in the same situation. And if the end sometimes justify the means. Unfortunately the killer isn't the least bit interesting although the film starts off by making the killer seem like a interesting character. Although the film moves a bit slow at times, has a well woven plot that will keep most audiences intrigued from beginning to end with it's drama and suspense. The main reason I saw this is because it's a Christopher Nolan film and it didn't really disappoint.7.8/10"
83,"Two detectives travel to canada to help to solve a mysterious crime case (murder of a girl). Will Dormer is characterized es really smart and the best, detective around. Although the local police can't find enough evidence, it takes Will just a view interviews to kind of solve the case. He just ""knows"" things and people immediately tell him how it really was... They set a trap to find the suspect. Because it is extremely foggy, he shoots his colege in an accident. Then he doesn't say it was an accident, no, he tries to hide the evidence, changes stuff, lies... Which is not so smart and he must know better! Its just luck that he is not caught immediately. Mr Finch, the real murder, hears everything and sees everything except you could probably see 3m that foggy day... He must have stood right next to them... Then he blackmails Will and blames somebody else who gets arrested for the murder of the girl.All that time Will can't sleep because in canada the sun doesn't set. In his room he tries to darken his room by using a kind of transparent tape to block the sun... Why? Why is he no just asking for a really dark room. Or use a kind of blindfold... This irritated me so much. The best detective in the world is not able to darken his room? And why the whole sleepdeprivation motive? In memento it really has a function in the movie. Here, Will is just always tired and the whole movie is called like that. Its just weired. It dorsn't add to the storry. He doesn't sleep for 6 days, right. He doesn't tell anybody... Doesn't use sleep medicarion...
And why did Mr Finch clean the girls body after the murder, without any stress and then levae the backpack with his book inside? He is portraied as the smartesd guy arround, but makes the most stupid mistakes...
The movie is not bad at all but feels a bit dumb and forced at times. The conversations between will and finch are great. The way the story goes is interesting but it's feels too constructed and at times not comprehensible."
84,"Two policemen, Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent in Alaska to make an investigation around the murder of a high school girl. Convinced that the murder was committed by a serial killer, Dormer decides to organize a police raid in an isolated house where seems to live the suspected murderer. But he (unintentionally?) kills his team mate. Fortunately, no-one saw him and because he doesn't want to be suspected, he gives a coherent reason about Eckhart's death which enables him to be saved. But the real murderer (Robin Williams) saw him killing Eckhart and starts to blackmail him.It is from this reversal of situation, the cop dominated by the killer, that ""Insomnia"" draws its originality. Here, several factors (that play in favor of Williams to the detriment of Pacino) explain this: Al Pacino's sickness: insomnia which prevents him from sleeping and especially the scenery where the action takes place, Alaska. An apparently peaceful land at least for its inhabitants but dreadful for foreigners, especially for Al Pacino. Indeed, the fact that it is always daylight only makes his sickness worse and makes him vulnerable in Williams' eyes. It is useful to add that Al Pacino is dazzling as an insomniac cop and the director Christopher Nolan emphasizes on his progressive weakening throughout the movie. On another hand, it is not a coincidence if his name is Dormer. It means ""sleeper"" in French so I think that only French people who watched this movie can appreciate the irony.With all that has been previously said, ""Insomnia"", according to me partly renews the detective movie. The result gives a solid and carefully constructed thriller. The sole shortcoming Christopher Nolan and his crew did is having hired Robin Williams to act the role of the killer. Throughout his career, he has been hired so many times in good roles and here, it is difficult to see him in the shoes of a criminal. Moreover, when he appears on the screen, the movie becomes quite talkative. These handicaps stop the movie from ranking among the greatest thrillers ever made but all the same, ""Insomnia"" constitutes a very good moment."
85,"I saw this movie at a preview screening last night.  Throughout the movie I was on the edge of my seat, waiting for the resolution of an engaging, suspenseful film.  Well, I got one.  It's too bad that it was one of the most anticlimactic endings I have ever seen.  Despite great performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams, I walked out of the theatre severely disappointed.  It's sad that the final few minutes of the film can ruin an otherwise good movie, but it happened here.  I'm still upset at the terrible ending.  I gave the movie a 7, but only because I'm feeling generous, and 95% of the movie was great.  Still, it's worth seeing.  You may not think so from the review, but that's just me venting.  It's a very good film. Perhaps I was just expecting something more Memento-like of an ending from Christopher Nolan.  You can judge for yourself."
86,"I'm one of Christopher Nolan's biggest fans. I think he was best filmmaker in the past decade, and if he continues making highly innovative,different,engrossing and intense films like memento,Batman Begins,TDK and now Inception, he's going to have a claim to be one of the greatest directors of all time. He's certainly on his way there. This film is by no means lacking in creativity, but when you look at Nolan's other works, this is no doubt the odd one out, there is genre subversion with the classic dark noir scenes replaced by omnipresent sunlight. The plot is good,but not great. What really draws you in is Al Pacino showing his greatness as an actor with a brilliant rendition of William Dommer,the title character .A cat-and-mouse game between hero-cop-with- skeletons-in-his-closet-suffering-from-insomnia-and-guilt and criminal- with-ace-up-his-sleeve is intriguing and engaging. But so,Robin William's appearance somehow hurts the movie, who,despite his talent,gives an unusually lackluster performance. The movie then loses its pace and intensity,and I found my attention wandering,something I thought impossible during a Nolan Movie. The 24-day concept is new and refreshing,Hillary Swank also gives a solid performance. The first 1 hour was very promising.Yet, somewhere in between, the movie loses its intensity, and already lacking Nolan's characteristic incredibly out-of-the-box-theme, it also loses its chance at greatness. Despite that,it's not a bad movie by any stretch. It's definitely worth a watch. Catch it for another stellar performance from one of Hollywood's stalwarts and Nolan's clever cinematography."
87,"A good thriller this one, atmospheric, taught and keeps you guessing. I sure do like Robin Williams in these roles as the bad guy, (also check out One Hour Photo) he is so good, creepy in an understated way. Al Pacino gives a great performance here too, conflicted, stressed and slowly unraveling from lack of sleep. I think his character stays awake for 6 days and it was fascinating to watch him try to cover his expanding pack of lies while going crazy. (Director) Nolan sure likes to torture his leads in unique ways.Insomnia takes place in a remote Alaskan town where, because its summer the sun doesn't set. Two Los Angeles detectives are dispatched there to investigate the homicide of a young girl (why, I'm not sure). Hilary Swank plays an impressionable young officer who meets their seaplane -I liked her here, trying to impress Al Pacino as the folklorish cop hero.While apprehending the suspect Al accidentally (?) shoots his partner and then covers it up, giving the lurking Robin Williams killer character blackmail ammunition against him. These two have some great scenes together, cat and mousing their way through the second half.The scenery is beautiful here, unique especially if you don't know better as I found myself distracted at times by Squamish (B.C) posing as Alaska with shots of the Chief, the mill, Chieftain pub, Britannia beach etc. A good thriller. 2/9/15"
88,"So the story of the movie is about a detective named Will who goes to a small town in Alaska to track down the murderer of a young woman, on the hunt he shoots a fellow officer but keeps it a secret and lies about what happens which haunts his journey on the hunt.It's a slow burn, we know who the killer is like 40 minutes into the 2 hour movie which can be okay but there was no feeling of satisfaction with the end, I thought the choice of the female cop instead of pointing the gun and one person she points at another and it was STUPID beyond stupid and yea that's my complaint on that hahahaI loved the acting, Robin was fantastic and definitely the stand out as I rarely see him in roles like this. Al Pacino is also good, the usual struggling detective role suited him but nothing new for me.It's a decent watch, not many twists it's not that kind of movie, it is an easy cop movie is how i find it, 7/10."
89,"If I seem a tad nit-picky, it's because I was immediately drawn into this stylish thriller; director Christopher Nolan's follow-up to ""Memento"". Within a half-hour, I had ""Insomnia"" pegged as an ethereal tale of guilt and vengeance set in ""the land of the midnight sun"" (I'd already begun to write my review). With three Oscar-winning performers carrying the story forward, I figured that I was in for a treat. I was wrong. Al Pacino was at his best. With all the intensity he had in ""Heat"" coupled with the passive, haunted aura his Michael Corleone. The film survived by his grace only. When we drifted from the psychological portrait of Pacino's character that had been building up for the entire film to the conventional get-the-bad-guy mode, the film becomes ""Hawaii 5-O"" Alaskan-style. The mind-toying feeling of ""Memento"" tried to squeeze into ""Insomnia"" via exceptional editing and inventive camerawork with an inspired setting, but it doesn't stick around. Around the 1 1/2 hour mark, the plot gets ludicrous, the lines get screwy, and, in general, the film goes downhill. By the time the end came, I felt how the sleep-deprived Pacino looked: weary and waiting for the end. One climax fell after another and I lost interest. The suspense was still there, but the thrill was gone, and by the time the credits rolled I was disappointed by the poor excuse for an ending. As for the two other stars, Hilary Swank and Robin Williams, they never quite fit in. Swank seemed like the woman showing she can do everything the boys can (her character is compared to Nancy Drew) and it serves only to have her be the stereotypical damsel-in-distress. Williams is good, completely cast against type, but good. 7/10 Stars.Quick recommendation: see ""Manhunter"", it's not as stylish, but it's definitely better."
90,"I remember the point during this film when the first event happened that would be a spoiler if I mentioned it, and it wasn't very far into the film. So don't expect this review to give much more than a feeling for who most of the characters are and the general atmosphere.The film opens with detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart being flown over some lovely but forbidding landscape in a twin engine float plane, discussing an investigation that Internal Affairs is doing on them back in Los Angeles. They arrive in Nightmute, Alaska, and are met by a junior detective named Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) who is a big fan of Dormer's -- even having written a paper on one of his cases when she was at the police academy. Dormer looks tired already, and he hasn't even figured out yet that the sun won't set during his entire stay in this town.The case they have been sent here to help out on is a murder of a high school girl. The very early parts of the investigation are routine, with the Los Angeles cops bringing a great deal of expertise to bear, helping the locals see what they may have missed or assumed. Then the aforementioned event happens, and the film becomes more interesting and also much more tense.The performances are good, though unremarkable. Pacino is unable to sleep (hence the film's title), and becomes more and more tired as the days go by, and this seems believable. Swank is fine but isn't given as much to work with, except perhaps in one brief scene near the end. I did like Paul Dooley (who played the father in ""Breaking Away"") in the small role of the local police chief.This film was directed by Christopher Nolan, whose previous film was the outstanding ""Memento."" This is a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name, which is available on DVD but which I have not seen. This film doesn't use as obvious of a hook as did ""Memento,"" but it does frequently use short flash images to show what Dormer is thinking about. Not all of these images make sense at first, but eventually things do come together. And speaking of images, the cinematography is very good, especially of the Alaskan countryside (although much of the film was shot in British Columbia).This film is very good, to the extent that I have been very close to giving it another half star. It's mostly gone from the theaters here, so see it soon if you can.Seen on 6/23/2002."
91,"""Insomnia"" can be regarded as an example of neo-noir, the type of film which uses modern cinema techniques while trying to capture the spirit of the classic films noirs from the forties and fifties. Other examples of neo-noir include Polanski's ""Chinatown"" from the seventies, Lawrence Kasdan's ""Body Heat"" from the early eighties, or the more recent ""L.A. Confidential"". A 17-year-old girl named Kay Connell is found murdered in a small Alaska fishing town and two Los Angeles detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart are sent to assist the local police with their investigation.Dormer, the older of the two, is regarded as a star of the LAPD, responsible for putting a number of major criminals behind bars. He is so famous that his investigations are studied as textbook cases at police academies. Yet he and his partner Eckhart are now themselves under investigation, as the LAPD's Internal Affairs department suspect that they may have been guilty of planting false evidence against suspects.The key moment in the film comes during a stakeout which Dormer has arranged to lure the killer into the open. The operation goes wrong, and the suspect escapes into the fog. In the ensuing confusion, Dormer shoots and kills Eckhart by mistake. As none of the other officers witnessed the shooting, they assume that Eckhart was shot by the fleeing murder suspect, and Dormer does not enlighten them. He knows that Eckhart had been offered an immunity deal in exchange for his testimony in the Internal Affairs investigation. As Dormer was indeed guilty of planting evidence against one man, a murder suspect named Dobbs, Eckhart's testimony could have put him in jail. Given that he had an obvious motive to kill his partner, Dormer fears that no-one will believe that Eckhart's shooting was accidental.Ellie Burr, a young female police officer with the local force, is assigned to investigate Eckhart's shooting. She was once a great admirer of Dormer, whose methods she studied at police college, but now starts to suspect that her idol may have feet of clay and that Eckhart's death may not have been an accident. To make matters worse for Dormer, he is blackmailed by Kay's killer, a local crime novelist named Walter Finch, who knows the truth about Eckhart's shooting. Finch offers to remain silent about this matter on condition that Dormer directs suspicion away from him by planting false evidence implicating Kay's abusive boyfriend Randy.A complex plot of this nature was one of the hallmarks of film noir. Another hallmark was an atmosphere of moral ambiguity, often involving corruption on the part of the police or others with a responsibility for enforcing the law. Dormer is a morally ambiguous character, not altogether unsympathetic despite his wrongdoing. He was led astray not by financial corruption but by his passion to bring criminals to justice; he believed firmly that Dobbs was guilty and deserved to be punished, and that tampering with the evidence was a lesser evil than letting such a man go free. The title is a reference to Dormer's inability to sleep; he blames this on the perpetual daylight of the Alaskan summer but there is a strong implication that his feelings of guilt and anxiety are also to blame. Ironically, his surname is derived from the Latin ""dormire"", meaning ""to sleep"".Watching Al Pacino in this movie is like watching a masterclass in acting. Every expression, every gesture, even the slightest inclination of his head is full of meaning as his character is slowly driven mad by his predicament. Dormer is a haunted, guilt-ridden figure, torn between his desire to do the right thing and his desire to preserve himself and his reputation. Rather surprisingly Pacino did not receive an Oscar nomination for this film. The Academy seem to have lost interest in him in recent years; he has not had a single nomination since his long-overdue ""Best Actor"" award for ""Scent of a Woman"" (which is far from being his best film). He receives excellent support from Hilary Swank as Ellie and from Robin Williams as Finch. It came as something of a surprise to me to see Williams, normally the hero, as a villain. He had played a terrorist in ""The Secret Agent"", but that was a relatively minor role.A third hallmark of film noir was its distinctive visual style, generally marked by expressionistic, moody black-and-white photography. The spiritual ""blackness"" which gives these films their name is often matched by a literal darkness. It would probably be impossible to recreate this look in a modern film, but the challenge for neo-noir directors is to create an equivalent visual style for their productions. Kasdan manages this well in ""Body Heat"", a film whose a colour scheme is dominated by blacks, reds and oranges, emphasising the feelings of heat and passion. (That film, which deals with an adulterous affair, is set against the backdrop of a Florida heatwave).Whereas the atmosphere of ""Body Heat"" is sultry and tropical, that of ""Insomnia"" is cool and Northern. Even though it is midsummer we are always aware that we are in the Arctic. Nevertheless, Christopher Nolan is also able to bring a distinctive look to his film. In some ways this look is the opposite of film noir; while that genre was dominated by night and shadows, ""Insomnia"" is dominated by grey skies, mists and a perpetual pale, milky sunlight. The fog in which Dormer shoots Eckhart can be seen as symbolic of the moral fog of confusion and ambiguity in which the story takes place. The high standards of acting and direction mean that this is one of the better crime thrillers of recent years. 7/10"
92,"Christopher Nolan takes on a noir detective story with a unique location. Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) arrives in Alaska, tired but ready to work. He and his partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are greeted by local policewoman Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank). The Los Angeles detectives are investigating the murder of a young high school girl Kay Connell (Crystal Low) but Dormer is disoriented by the daylight in the middle of the night. They stay at a hotel run by Rachel Clement (Maura Tierney). Hap is being investigated by Internal Affairs and is thinking of confessing which would incriminate Will. The next morning on little sleep, Will and Hap head to the high school to interrogate Kay's boyfriend Randy Stetz (Jonathan Jackson) who is uncooperative during the questioning. He does admit that Kay was seeing someone else but he doesn't know who it is. Will treats Ellie as a protégé schooling her on the procedure and the little things of an investigation. When Kay's bookbag is found in a cabin, it provides clues and a trap for Will to devise. Dormer continues to threat over the IA investigation, doubting his own tactics. When the amateur Alaskan police botch the stakeout alerting the suspect, a foot chase ensues through the cabin and fog. A policeman is shot but Will Dormer pursues the suspect across slick rocks and fires into the mist possibly shooting and killing his partner Hap. Overcome with grief, Will is unable to sleep and keeps reflecting back on his previous shortcuts he took to nab awful criminals. He works to cover up the possibility that he shot his partner as he becomes increasingly dazed. Noises disturb him and he hallucinates his partner giving him accusatory looks. The killer calls him up on the phone and reveals that he knows of Will's guilt in killing his partner. Ellie suspects that something isn't quite right with Will's account of his partner's shooting. Will confront Tanya Francke (Katharine Isabelle) taking her to the dump where Kay's body was dumped after spooking her by playing chicken with a truck. Tanya mentions Kay's secret lover who promised the young victim all sorts of things. The killer calls him again at the station taunting him about what he knows and Will offers to meet him. He deciphers the clues and heads to the house of Walter Finch (Robin Williams), a mystery novel author.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
93,"Strong performances, a captivating central conflict, and beautiful landscapes of Canada. Distracting plot holes take away from the experience: Pacino's character gets around Alaska as if he knows the state like the back of his hand. The ending is a dumb shoot-out. It's a disappointing conclusion for sure."
94,"Really compelling story, with multiple plots closing in on each other as the movie progresses. It has a overarching theme and message perfectly fitting the characters, making them believable and likeable despite their flaws. The acting is convincing, the dialogue however is less so.The main issue is certainly the pacing, as it feels very drawn out, especially expressing the issue central to the movie - insomnia. However, the doubt that was attempted to be caused as a result of it did not come across well and was not at all convincing. This could have made a significant impact on how the movie and what the protagonist sees would have been interpreted. Unfortunately, this aspect fell completely flat and thus the issue of insomnia felt very much unneeded."
95,"It's weird watching this in the middle of watching Twin Peaks. Both are about out of town lawmen coming to an out of the way small town in the heavily wooded parts of the American northwest to investigate the murder of a high school girl whose body had been dumped, naked, in plastic bags. The lawmen stay at lodges, and there's even a use of the name Leland. Based on the Norwegian movie of the same name, Christopher Nolan's Insomnia, at some level, feels like the more literal version of David Lynch's surrealistic exploration of a murder. But enough about that, how's the movie?Al Pacino is Will Dormer, a soon to be disgraced Los Angeles robbery-homicide detective who's been sent to Alaska to help the local police department investigate the murder of Kay Connell. With him is his partner, Hap, who is considering cutting a deal with Internal Affairs that will throw Will under the bus but save his own skin. Will, convinced that if they just maintain a strong front, is disgusted and disappointed in his partner's willingness to give in. With the local police, they find Kay's backpack and let out a message to the community that leads the killer to try and reclaim it at a remote cabin in a rocky and foggy location outside of town. In the confusion, Will accidentally shoots and kills Hap who dies convinced that Will did it on purpose, and the killer witnessed it all.The movie gets its title from the fact that the remote Alaskan town of Nightmute is above the Arctic Circle and has no nighttime that season and Will cannot get any sleep in his well-lit hotel room at the local lodge. That he cannot sleep means that he cannot forget the pressure he is under back home, the guilt he feels for shooting Hap, and that he's being squeezed by the Kay's killer, the local author Walter Finch, played by Robin Williams. This feeling is sold cinematically through over-exposed images, cross-cutting to previous moments, and blurring sound design as Pacino's performance because more and more strung out. He often looks, in the latter parts of the film, to be struggling to simply keep his eyes open and focus.All of this is solid stuff. Pacino is good. Williams is understated and creepy as Finch. Hillary Swank is eager as the young Detective Ellie who gets tasked with writing the report on Hap's shooting. Everything is cleanly filmed in a professional manner, and the sequence in the fog is just the right combination of clear and murky to give us solid perspective into a hard to discern situation. The appearance of Williams provides an interesting level of menace, and Pacino's increasing desperation as he loses more and more control of the situation is played really well.I suppose the only thing holding me back from appreciating this film more is the ending. It's not that I don't like to see flawed protagonists relearn the correct values. It's that I'm not sure I buy Will Dormer following through to the end. You see, Dormer, at a certain point, gives up on getting out clean with any hope of also getting Finch held responsible for Kay's murder. So, he drives to Finch's cabin in the middle of the country to kill him with Ellie having coincidentally gone at the same time to collect a piece of evidence for the Kay murder, Finch having come forward at Dormer's insistence because there was no hiding the fact that Finch and Kay had a previous connection. Finch, the very careful murderer, accidentally leaves out the dress Kay was in when he murdered her, leading Ellie to figure out in a split second that he did it, even though, as far as we know, the police never knew what dress Kay had been wearing and it was well known that Finch had bought the girl clothes. The meat of the final confrontation is built around this realization that feels thin at best. So, Dormer has to save Ellie, who's also figured out that Dormer did in fact shoot Hap in a solid piece of movie detective work, kill Finch, and, as he lays dying due to a shotgun blast from Finch, insists on Ellie letting the truth out about Hap's death.Now, I've seen the original film, and it ends very different with the Dormer analogue getting away clean. That's not necessarily what I want from this American version, though. My criticism isn't because this takes a nicer route than it's progenitor, but that it's a combination of too convenient, too thin, and too clean. Ellie being there at the same time feels almost like a distraction. Ellie figuring out that Finch is the killer feels too easy. Dormer wanting to just kill Finch feels like the right move for his character, but using his dying breath to accept responsibility feels like a step too far. There's nothing really wrong with this ending, but I suspect there's a superior, more interesting on in a previous draft of the script.Overall Insomnia is a finely crafted thriller with a strong central character at its core. It's the sort of thing one might expect from an up and coming director given a decent budget in order to try and prove himself. The personalities involved in front of the camera were probably too strong for the young Brit to fully control, so he corralled them effectively. He made something safe to prove that he could operate in the system, reminding me a bit of Orson Welles' The Stranger, though Nolan and Welles would go on to have vastly different careers."
96,"I avoided this one for a long time because I thought it was an adaptation to the Stephen King novel of the same title. (Wasn't a fan of that book, if you couldn't guess.) This was actually very enjoyable. Robin Williams knocks his role out of the park, and Pacino isn't bad either. I wish Williams and Pacino had been on screen together more, though."
97,"This was a difficult one to find to watch in Australia. Christopher Nolan has made many of my favourite films and Pacino is one of my favourite actors so I keenly wanted to give this a watch. And he's brilliant, Detective Hanna in Heat is one of my favourite film characters of all time, so to see him as a detective again (albeit a less frenetic, less energetic and more beaten down one) was my highlight as are all the actors in this film.The setting of no night and all day is really interesting and utilised here, with streets busy during the ""day"" and quite during the late hours but still well lit. Morally it raises interesting questions, and thankfully unlike some films by the end it satisfactorily answers them. A great score too.The only reason it does not get higher is because it's still a crime film, set in northern America which isn't too different (besides the big names) from a midday thriller, even if it's a way above average one."
98,"(2002) Insomnia
PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLERRemake of the critically acclaim 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name. Directed by Christopher Nolan starring Robin Williams as Walter Finch, the psychotic killer whose just witness cop Will (Al Pacino) accidentally shoot and kill his best friend resulting into many problems of sleep leading to a possible cover up. Between this one and the original, while they both consist of the exact same set up, I can relate to the Christopher Nolan version more since it contains more 'thinking' dialogue and can also relate to the North American setting as opposed to the 1997 version which i also give the same rating centers more on atmosphere and less on dialogue. One of the more memorable scenes has the two stars conversing with one another while sailing on a ferry boat, seeing Will (Pacino) look so helpless staring at the killer's face unable to do anything, and Walter projecting in speaking terms almost a mirror image of Will was an absolute classic and requires a heck of a lot of thought."
99,"The movie is a decent crime drama thriller which tries to show many things but fails at many places.The story was simple and easily predictable, the screenplay was uneven, the direction was good and the performances were average. The writing of villian's character and his motive was weak. The main character was also not that well written. The suspense of the story was easily predictable and thrill part felt flat. But one thing, even after all this flaws or weaknesses, the overall movie was engaging.Overall, it was a decent crime drama thriller which could have been more tight and more in-depth."
100,"The film is really really good. Gripping and complex, it does everything a good thriller should. It's hard to live upto a film like ""memento"" but it's still a great movie. Al Pacino plays his usual cop with a past role with ease. And Robin Williams breezes through an unusual role for him. For once, he is the ""bad"" guy, and he really does do well being creepy. All in all, a fab movie. But be patient, it may take awhile for some, to start enjoying it."
101,"Right from the opening credits the mood of quiet tension never lets up. The strong contrast between the icy landscape and blood leaking all over a material isn't there just to be a cool visual. We see our protagonist Will Dormer, a weary detective whose face looks burdened by the troubles that follow him. An insomniac, hunted by internal affairs for his suspect methods and now sent to investigate a murder in a remote town where the sun never sets. It's a question of how long before he snaps. Pacino is on top form in the type of role he's always excelled in. Tough and experienced after years in the job, but emotionally vulnerable and perpetually on the edge for exactly the same reason. His younger partner Eckhart is willing to dish out information on him. The turning point comes when a trap set for the killer goes wrong and Dormer kills Eckhart after mistaking him in the fog. There's no doubting that it was an accident, but Dormer knows that with the case against him he has no chance of making such a claim. He manages to just about suppress his guilt and concoct a story that lets him off clean. There's one major problem for him however, the killer knows that he did it.Insomnia isn't just a moody title, it's a reflection of Dormer's mind-set as a whole. How a man's mental state has become so damaged that his morality and ethics have become blurred. It questions how far he's willing to go to do what he knows is right deep down, even if it goes against the very principles he's lived by his entire life. The permanent daylight of Alaska serves to highlight his insomnia in a visual sense, bringing it to forefront so there's no place for him to hide. Too often films of this ilk try to add some kind of quirk or motif without giving it a reasoning or representation. But it's something that is handled impressively here.Bar Pacino, two performances really standout. The first being Hilary Swank as the plucky Ellie Burr, a role she plays to perfection. She never goes for the typical rookie cop trying to impress, she instead plays it audacious but collected, someone who wants to do the right thing but understands the difficulties that come with the job. The second is Robin Williams as the killer Finch. It never ceases to amaze me how someone so funny can reach such depths and play such disturbed characters. It's comparable to his part in 'One Hour Photo', released the same year. He takes an understated approach, making Finch more unnerving than raving and it works in give the role an edge.The relationship between Dormer and Finch actually turns out to be one of the highlights. We very rarely get a thriller that makes such a valid connection between the hero and villain. It is clear that the two of them share the same psychological problems. Insomnia haunts their every step. Notably their both trying to achieve the same thing, clearing their names. Finch wants to people to think he's innocent and Dormer wants to pin Eckhart's death on anyone but himself. Their relationship is fascinating for how manipulative it is. Both latch on to each other despite appearing to be polar opposites because they need to work together to survive. There are a couple of occasions where things can happen a little too conveniently or the plot ties together too neatly. Some of the action sequences feel a little out of place given the tone, though the chase across the logs is handled excellently. Nolan's reliance on the bigger picture can sometimes lead to the little details being forgotten about or hastily connected. However the story itself is a nice antidote to his previous film 'Memento'. While that film was chained so tightly to its gimmick that there was no room for anything to breathe or develop, Insomnia is much sparser and atmospheric. More interested in building tension through fog and isolation. It allows the characters to soak up the ghostly settings and for that to play into their psychology.Why the film drew Nolan's attention is obvious. It plays on themes that he finds interesting, mainly the troubled morality of the central character. Whereas most thrillers are interested in the details of the investigation and the crime, Insomnia makes a wise choice to instead examine the mind-set of Dormer and how he is distressed by his choices. The brightness proves a crucial aspect. Despite the murky underside of the case, the light is always on Dormer. He has nowhere to hide his feelings, even sleep has rejected him."
102,Christopher Nolan is my favorite director. This is not his best work. The original Insomnia film was amazing. This one is just ok. The only Nolan film I don't own and don't care to.
103,"*****may contain spoilers*****At first I was just going to focus on the movie review but I read other viewers comments and I will give my opinions of their comments also. This was a decent performance by Pacino, not Oscar quality as some reviewers exclaim. (Admit it folks, this ain't Godfather, Scarface, Dog Day Afternoon quality, more Heat, Sea of Love quality huh) I thought the supporting cast was excellent. Robin Williams ability to interject passion in a role of a low keyed psychopath amazed me, he is truly an underrated actor. The neophyte detective also performed admirably. One of the previous reviewers referred to Al Pacino's character as a ""true American Patriot"" How sick is that!  His character was almost as disgusting as Robin Williams character. Here is a decorated police officer who plants evidence, murders a innocent man and conspires with a child molester / murderer. What a patriot. Integrity is an important part of patriotism. I was going to go into a rant about priest and N.Y.P.D but this is not the proper forum for a discussion of that nature. The point is one bad act erases all the good. I was pulling for ALL the bad guys to die at the end."
104,"What a disappointment!I'll keep this short:1. I never for a moment bought the idea of Robin Williams as a killer. He came off exactly as he was - a fallen star looking to regain street cred in an edgy thriller. Still, it was better than seeing him with a red rubber nose though.2. The Hollywood Influence. The Pacino character is completely softened from the original. Examples: A) The dog being shot is already dead. B) The killer, not the cop, plants false evidence in the boyfriend's home. C) The underage best friend hits on the cop, not the other way around. D) The desk clerk is not roughed up by the cop in abortive sex scene. God forbid America's protagonists have some unsavory qualities.3. The Hollywood Influence II: Must every movie be loaded with unnecessary profanity? I don't remember ""f---"" being said dozens of times in the original; I also don't remember anyone complaining about the lack of cursing in the original.4. The Gratuitous Chase Scene. Yeah, the romp over the wet logs was a cool set piece in itself (although it reminded me of a similar sequence in STAKEOUT), but what exactly was the point of it? Williams escapes, only to agree to meet with Pacino later on the ferry. Why would he do this? To insert an unnecessary chase to sate America's need for action, I guess. This scene is neither included nor needed in the original - this is supposed to be a psychological thriller, not a conventional action flick.5. Instead of the main character having to live with himself after his amoral actions, this version has Pacino die at the end, alleviating the weight of his conscience.That's enough for now. Should I have compared the two movies so liberally? The '97 version (8/10) being shown on IFC before I headed out to the 'plex probably didn't help matters. But even if I had never seen the foreign version, I'd still would have had a strange sense of deja vu. Nolan's INSOMNIA cribs from SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (cop finding clues in dead girl's bedroom, unsuspecting heroine enters bad guy's home), SEVEN (knocking on bad guy's door at moment bad guy comes home that leads to a chase in murky dampness, after which bad guy calls cop at bad guy's home), and TV's TWIN PEAKS (in sleepy mill town girl is sleeping with boyfriend of now-dead best friend which is discovered by detective called in from big city).But if you're looking for some great footage of lush Alaskan wilderness, you've got cause to rejoice. The gorgeous cinematography here is the one aspect that surpasses the original. Props to Wally Pfister for all the evocative atmosphere he's created.OK, so this wasn't very short. Sorry.6/10"
105,"Wonderful start for this drama about a hardened homicide detective, with an Internal Affairs investigation hanging over him, and his partner being loaned to an small town Alaska police force to help solve the mysterious murder of a young woman. However, the film starts to go downhill shortly after we learn the detective's secret and he subsequently kills his partner, who is going to testify against him. The killing may or may not be accidental and we are now thrust into the detective's guilt trip over the circumstances and his implausible 'strange bedfellow' agreement with the young woman's killer. No real mystery here and the good acting is overshadowed by too many holes in the plot but still entertaining and a good watch if you don't have high hopes."
106,"Williams at his best.  Brilliantly acted and thrilling movie.  Not only was the scenery great, but the suspense kept you in this movie till the end.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who like dramas and suspense movies.  Oh, and if you really want to see Robin Williams, check out this movie instead of One Hour Photo."
107,"I think most movie remakes are totally unnecessary because 1) they either show nobody came up with a good story and therefore just took the easy way out by recycling an old one, 2) some director thought he could surpass the original and almost surely failed to do so, or 3)the movie's foreign and American's don't like that If you think number 3) isn't true, just think about it for a second. If there's a demand for something, then somebody usually wants That something. Was there ever a time I read an article on our beloved IMDb with a title like: ""US cinema's can't wait for the next Almodovar picture to be screened"". Now movie remakes derive from the US, by not even checking somewhere if this is true I know it is, without a doubt, a fact. There are nations (I know of bigger European ones, like Germany, France, Spain, Italy), that for generations have been borough up by watching every single possible thing on TV dubbed into their language. Be it ""The Simpsons"" or ""Casablanca"", they put huge amounts of money into the industry of dubbing and the end result is these nations have poor knowledge of other languages. Except for Germans, who luckily share a language similar to the English language, this is a fact. American't take a different approach, they brand the stuff their way, ALL the way. Big bucks are put into making a movie that's already been done. All this because in the end, they were borough up by watching only American stuff, and because Hollywood likes to earn something as well.It's actually funny and disturbing at the same time thinking just how racist this discussion could become, if pursued on. But this is not my point at all, amidst the almost accusative comments I've made thus far I've almost lost hold of it. In short, if there's a good European movie made, an American version will follow. This is sad enough as it is. What's even sadder is that this is happening faster and faster. It's almost a crime, the makers of the original get some Hollywood money for the rights to the movie, and the price they pay is much greater. Instead of them taking credit for a well done movie, the Hollywood machine does.Why Chris Nolan decided to make a remake is beyond me. After a story like ""Memento""!!! There is nothing bad that can be said about his version apart from it being a remake. Which is more than enough. The only bright side of remakes, and you can quote me on this, is they make you discover good originals."
108,"Today was my second time watching ""Insomnia"" and it was like watching it for the first time. Apparently, I didn't appreciate some of the finer qualities of the movie the first viewing. Not that I consider it a work of art now, but I do like it a little more.This movie had me torn. Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) was sent from L.A. to Night Mute, Alaska to help solve a murder. He came with his partner Detective Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) and the two of them brought a little baggage with them. Dormer was being investigated by Internal Affairs for something back in L.A. and Eckhart was going to cut a deal with I.A. which would have put Dormer on the chopping block.Fast-forwarding a bit; on a foggy Alaska day while trying to track down the murderer, Dormer shot his partner--accidentally or purposely, we can only assume, but Dormer certainly covered up the shooting. He only had two problems: a determined investigator in Officer Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) and the killer (Robin Williams) saw him shoot his partner. What this created was a unique situation where the killer reached out to Dormer to form a pact between the two of them: ""You don't tell on me and I don't tell on you."" What an unlikely alliance, but begrudgingly and alliance was formed.So, how was I torn?I've rooted for Al Pacino in every movie I've seen him in, whether he was good or bad (with the exception of the movie ""Heat."" I wanted De Niro to get away). But in this movie I found myself wanting him to be caught for his cover up and allying with a murderer, while at the same time wanting him to get away with it because he's Al Pacino. It was such unfamiliar territory for me and I didn't like it. In a small way I have to credit writer Hillary Seitz and director Christopher Nolan for them making me feel as torn as I did.I think the movie had the best possible ending. Both Dormer and Walter Finch (Robin Williams) died, and they died by the hands of each other as if they had a blood pact. And Dormer, though tainted, somewhat redeemed himself before dying. Burr was going to throw away the only evidence connecting him with his partners death and he prevented her from that saying, ""Don't lose your way."" It was an ending that I certainly loved as a Pacino fan. He couldn't just walk and I couldn't bear to see him get perp walked. It was the best of all possibilities as he finally got the sleep he so desired at a time in that part of the world where the sun never set."
109,"Sure, many stressful things are going on in the detective's mind and causing him to be disoriented. He talks to the lady at the front desk multiple times and as it is well known in Alaska, they usually have blackout curtains already installed. Everyone else isn't sleeping in bright light. Ask the desk for blackout curtains and go to sleep, why are you trying to cover the window with blankets and newspaper???Otherwise, Nolan is really a master at telling a detective story as he did with memento and the dark knight series."
110,"LA detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent to assist in an investigation of a murder in a small town in Alaska. Dormer and Eckhart are assisted by rookie officer Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank). This particular homicide case is far from straight forward as the killer has taken many precautions and does his best not to leave any clues - this in part is down to the killer being a 'crime writer' so it kind of makes him an unofficial expert. Dormer is starting to piece the puzzle together, but there is an unfortunate twist in the tale which forces Dormer to co-operate with the killer. Will Dormer be able to get his man whilst also managing to keep his reputation and integrity intact? I'll admit that this film was a little slow to get moving, but there were several things working in its favour. Firstly, there is the great chemistry between Al Pacino and Martin Donovan. Pacino can do this sort of acting role in his sleep (no pun intended) and his reputation really does proceed him. I'm not quite as familiar with Martin Donovan, but he was good and the back and forth between him and Pacino was top drawer. The film is also interesting from a scientific perspective - there is a scene in the film where they are discussing going to school to interrogate a potential suspect and one of the Alaskan officers says ""we can't go now it's 10 o'clock"" and Dormer says ""So what""? The Alaskan officers then inform him that it is in fact 10 o clock at night even though it is broad daylight outside - this isn't a plot hole btw. This is known as 'The Midnight Sun' and is witnessed in parts of Russia, Finland and Sweden and Alaska - it only occurs during the Summer months. I believe that the original film was set in Norway where the same phenomenon occurs.Insomnia starts off as a Crime/Mystery film and it does maintain this theme throughout the film. However, once Walter Finch (Robin Williams) is introduced the film switches tone and becomes more of a psychological thriller. I liked the change of tone and found the psychological mind games that Finch plays with Dormer to be very entertaining and somewhat creepy. Williams is great in his role as the psychologically disturbed Walter Finch. It's not often that you can say that Al Pacino ends up being 'out acted' but I really felt that Williams stole the show. Pacino was still good, but Williams excelled in his role.Unfortunately, whilst this build up was good and Williams character was both disturbing and interesting I just found that once all this was established the film didn't really have anywhere to go. Insomnia plays its hand early by revealing that Finch was the killer - in some ways I liked it because it proved to be engaging and an extremely good psychological battle of wits. The downside of this is that it also made the film far too predictable - why couldn't there have been a few suspects throughout the film in order to keep the audience guessing? There were no plot twists and far less suspense than there could have been. Insomnia felt very clinical and by the numbers with very few (if any surprises).Even though Insomnia is a film with lots of flaws, it is still a good film and is worth watching (but more for the psychological aspect rather than the crime/mystery aspect). I only realised that this was a remake after I'd watched this version so having enjoyed the remake I'll be sure to check out the original."
111,"Typical Hollywood movie.  Very predictable cop movie with no surprises. Disappointing when you consider C. Nolan's last movie.  some good cinematography, and an entertaining story, with good acting, regretfully cannot make up for a predictable story.  Enjoyed it, but people shouldn't be fooled into thinking it is a ""must see"" because of the director.  This movie is similar to underrated THE PLEDGE (2000) see them both."
112,"I was expecting to see a toe-to-toe knockdown fight between Pacino and Williams, and what I got was less exciting than watching the Iron Chef. The part of Robin Williams would have been better played by Wally Cox, or (by today's standards) by Woody Allen.The best part was watching Pacino and his progression into a world of sleep deprivation. WARNING: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE THE LEAST BIT SLEEPY OR SLEEP DEPRIVED!The ending was predictable and anti-climactic.  I should have gone to see ""About A Boy"" instead."
113,"First I watched Insomnia in theatre and I thought that it was great movie. Two days later I saw on TV Guide that Insomnia was on TV.  I searched IMDB and found out that the Insomnia (2002) is actually a remake of a Norwegian film by the same name Insomnia (1997).So I watched the movie on TV and I noticed that the plot was a somewhat altered.  One would assume that a remake would be a better with a budget of 50million and enormous star power, but that's not the case here.   I expected more from `Christopher Nolan, the creator of Memento'.I think the reason the remake is not as good is because they changed the characters to make Al Pacino and even Robin William (the bad guy) look better. They never wanted to make a better film; they wanted to manufacture a movie that would make millions and millions of dollars, like most of the movies that are made in the Hollywood today.The acting was okay and Christopher Nolan's directing of the movie was excellent, but overall I believe that the original Insomnia was much better."
114,"Who ever is calling this a smart adult movie is wrong. This movie has nothing on the likes of Memento. I had originally heard that due to insomnia, Pacino wasn't even sure if he had killed his partner, and that sounded intriguing. The fact that in the end he wasnt sure of his motivation was very unconvincing. There are no smart twists in this movie. In my opinion the acting wasn't that great either, just because Pacino looked like he hasnt slept in a week doesn't make for a great performance, because thats pretty much the way he looks all the time, same with that crappy In The Bedroom movie, just because Sissy Spacek looked burned out and crazy doesnt mean she gave a great performance, shes looks like that naturally. There were a few decent parts to the movie, like when Pacino was trying to stay awake driving and almost left the road, but that doesnt make up for the rest fo the crap. The detective work was alright too, better then an Ace Ventura movie anyways but overall the movie wasn't good at all. When I check my watch several times during a movie and finally leave, never wanting to watch that movie again I know it isnt a good movie. I should have watched Undervocer Brother."
115,"I saw ""Insomnia"" in a sneak preview and was expecting a freaky movie. Instead I got an ethical debate about murder and conscience. I would have enjoyed the movie if there were more insomnia-like effects on par with the short term memory-loss in ""Memento"". Al Pacino gets agitated and confused, but you do not really feel like he is losing his mind. Robin Williams is the villain, but he could have been a lot nastier. The plot also falls apart when you hear the explanations and the motives, although it would have been cooler backwards. It really feels like a really long ""Law & Order"" episode."
116,"I was kind by giving this movie a 6.  The ending was horrible and Pacino was more overblown than he's ever been (yes even more than ...And Justice for All).  Williams still had to make his wisecracks to flaw his serious role. What did Nolan sign on for???  Yeah, he can't do Memento every time...but at least after Pi, Aranofsky followed up with Requiem for a Dream.  Anyway, it was somewhat entertaining and one of the better movies of this year (Pray for a good fall season of movies...if Insomnia is the best, expect the year 2000 all over again for movies)"
117,"but not great.  I don't see where the raves are coming from.  Granted, the acting is good.  While Pacino was...well...Pacino, I thought the rest of the cast was excellent.  The direction was well-done - the scenery was stunning, moods were captured perfectly, etc.  My problem is the story line.  I thought it was old and cliched, and I haven't even seen the original movie. It was very predictable.Maybe my problem is that my expectations were too high...I saw the previews: Christopher Nolan - excellent; Pacino, Williams, Swank - great; Alaska - great;  the pieces seemed to be there to go above and beyond Memento and Following.  I felt that the pieces were not put together - mostly, but not fully.It's very much the same feeling I had after seeing ""Unbreakable"" because of the high hopes I had since seeing ""The Sixth Sense.""  I know these directors are capable of so much.  That's why I'll still be in line to see whatever's next from both of these new masters."
118,"For me, this film had most of the ingredients to be a great movie EXCEPT a great story!! It was neither suspenseful, thrilling nor intriguing. Just another ""tainted-cop-trapped-by-his-suspect"" recipe. Leftovers! Don't be surprised if it nearly puts you to sleep !!  6/10."
119,"INSOMNIA  **+_  Crime/Thriller Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary SwankIn rural Alaska, a police detective attempts to catch a murder suspect, but mistakenly shoots his own partner. The detective constructs an ever more complex web of lies to hide it. Then the bad guy tries his hand at blackmail. The title derives from the detective's inability to sleep with the combination of Alaska's midnight sun and his guilt over killing his partner. An intense psychological drama."
120,"I was skeptical at first, Robin Williams as a Murderer.  Again, though, Mr. Williams is on top of his game.  He is very believable, and in the end you want to hurt his character.  The casting of Al Pacino is perfect.  The tired, worn out detective could not have been played better by anyone else. If you are looking for an action packed thriller, then you might be disappointed.  If on the other hand you want a couple of hours of intense acting, and actors who make you think that their role is real, then this thriller is for you.  I really enjoyed this film."
121,"Perhaps it was the old lady sitting next to me with the heavy lilac perfume or perhaps it was the clods sitting behind me talking through the whole thing, but I found myself wishing that this movie would just get over already.  It seemed a little too long and not quite as interesting as I had hoped that it would be.The intriguing part of it was the question of  ""crossing the line"" and how justifiable it is.  I think that this aspect could have been better written with a lot more mystery as to Al Pacino's motivations.  Was he really going along with the killer or did he have something more up his sleeve as far as entrapment?Pacino was great as always, he was very subtle, expressing himself with just a smile or a one-liner.  Robin Williams held his own and Hillary Swank was just terrific and very believable in her supporting role as a rookie cop.
All in all, I think that this movie had potential, but the storyline could have been even better, so I gave it only a 6."
122,Wow ... SO disappointing!It's now official -- Al Pacino is washed up. And Robin Williams looked as if he took the role just for a free trip to Alaska. Hilary Swank's performance was the lone bright spot -- too bad the screenwriter didn't give her anything to do. This film is a sure cure for insomnia!
123,"i feel bad for christopher nolan, the director. he comes off the heels of mememto, which people may not have seen in the theater, but have gotten around to watching on dvd.  he not only gets good previous material here, but a budget and 3 oscar winners in the actor and actress categories. i won't give anything away.  there is only one thing a viewer of this film should do--rent the original (or watch it on ifc).  someone stepped in on nolan's film and made it too polite, without much risk. al pacino's character, dormer, is the one we must follow throughout the film.  in EVERY case in this film, i felt his character was justified in his actions.  unfortunately, his actions are a source of suspense and plot revelation in the film, but with little conflict (we know who did it from the COMMERCIALS) the story needs some internal conflict or character flaw to make it more interesting.  should he have done this?  should he have done that?  well, yes.  move along. i don't understand why everything has to be tidy at the end.  there is no thought process going on in a viewer's mind once the credits roll--that is all taken care of for us.  any question you might ask is moot by the finale. and that's sad.  anything that was sexual, mildly perverse, or disturbing was taken out of the original and sanitized to make a cleaner, more ""psychological"" film. nolan does nothing wrong here.  he adds clever flashbacks to make an old storyline juxtapose a newer one.  you'll see--it's something similar to what he did in memento, and it works again here.  the guy is 31 years old, has done three films.  i look forward to his next one, especially if it doesn't have major stars in it.  perhaps this is merely a case of him paying his dues in a bigger film so he can make better ones in the future with his vision. rating--6 out of 10.  it's not terrible, especially as a character study of pacino's dormer.  it just doesn't leave you with much to think or talk about."
124,"Insomnia is almost a collage of several other mystery films (namely Se7en) tied into one, but not distinctively. Although it wasn't completely repetitive, it was as cliché as detective work goes, and the movie didn't stand out one way or another. Whether it's the elusive murderer on the loose or the mentally plagued cop who's trying his best, this movie is predictable and lacks ingenuity. Accompanying the lack of creativity, the prime actors and actresses had average performances and the emotional conviction in the roles was often lacking. A straight plot followed by routine dialogue made Insomnia rather mundane and an effort to watch. Although there were particular exciting scenes, they were rather short and sparse. The resources were there, but execution was a miss.Whether it's L.A. Confidential, The Usual Suspects, Se7en or any other great mystery movie, these all had a strong emotional attachment that hook viewers into truly empathizing with the protagonists and mystery at hand. Unfortunately in Insomnia, it's almost like you already know the fate of the characters, and still don't care."
125,"SPOILERS, interpretation: This movie is a good example of how contrived Hollywood movies can get when they believe poetic justice to be an absolute necessity. With poetic justice, since both Williams and Pacino commit a sin, they must both be punished. Williams must be punished most because his crime was committed with clear intent. So in the end, Williams receives his punishment when he dies. Pacino dies as well, but there is a difference between his death: he repents before he dies. So what was intimated from the beginning is affirmed: though both men work together and both have committed a sin, Williams clearly represents evil while Pacino represents good. With his repentance, Pacino is assured his place in heaven, and William's punishment will continue in his hell-bound afterlife. This is further evinced when Pacino falls asleep because his conscience is now clear. The problem with this, which is nicely explained in Hermann Hesse's Demian' is that a deathbed repentance is quite easy and convenient. Take the biblical story of the repentant thieve for example. Two thieves are crucified with Jesus. One insults Jesus and one repents to Jesus, and is thus granted entrance to heaven. But is it really so virtuous to live a life of sin and then repent when staring death in the eye? The repentance is not authentic, but fear based. Hence, both Williams and the non-repentant thief are the virtuous ones, for truly accepting their life and it's decisions and its consequences. A final scene in which Pacino isn't made to look heroic would have been much preferred, because 1) it's not so very trite and would possibly redeem some of the movie's slow and self-serious plot, and 2) it's more philosophically and religiously coherent."
126,"It was with great anticipation I went to see Insomnia. With the acting talents of Al Pacino coupled with the director of the great film Memento, Christopher Nolan, surely we are on for a winner.The old adage rang true. You can have all the talent in the world but if the story is not there you are onto a loser!For two hours we trundle along with Pacino experiencing flash backs and Robin Williams breathing deeply down the phone. Hilary Swank helps to relieve the boredom with her investigations into Pacino's character but after five minutes of viewing we all know that she will save the day!Predictable and dull. Wait to rent it on DVD if you really must!"
127,"Insomnia is not a bad movie, but I found it quite boring.  Needless to say, I was disappointed after hearing the praise this movie got from critics and aquaintances.  No aspect of this film was done poorly; however, there is nothing in the film that held my interest.  The storyline seemed a little cheesy, and the characters are unappealing.  All in all, I'd give it a 5/10."
128,"As mentioned in my review of this film's 1997 Norwegian parent, of late I am deeply interested in the similarities and differences between foreign language films and their American remakes. With a fondness for both Scandinavian cinema and Al Pacino, the Insomnias were an obvious case to investigate.Remaining faithful to its forebear in terms of the main plot, Insomnia gives us Detective Will Dormer, assigned to the investigation of a 17 year old girl's murder. Amidst difficulty adjusting to the midnight sun of Alaska, an unfortunate accident forces him to lie about his actions. He becomes haunted by both his guilt and the threatening musings of the girl's murderer, who knows the truth.An interesting opening credits sequence combines images of a bloodstained fabric with the beautiful Alaskan setting this remake calls home. A fair answer to the original's setting, the remote wilderness offers incredible scenery, its iciness as entrancingly mysterious as the unexplained sanguine fibres. The first and most noticeable difference to set this apart from its Norwegian counterpart is the female detective, played here by Hilary Swank. Despite Swank's entirely likable performance, one cannot help but lament this change of direction. The original character's austerity was her strength; the alternative's naivety her weakness. The mentor-student dynamic which forms between Pacino and she is, while unique and understandable, far less effective than the tension of the original relationship. Due to a combination of the newly introduced IA subplot, the dropping of the retirement age and concomitant hearing problems of the main detective's partner, and the lack of an American gun ban, Dormer's ""accident"" and whether it is indeed that becomes more the focus of attention than the guilt of Engström's. Additionally, the original's heavy usage of insomnia in a metaphorical sense is largely replaced here by its physical effects. More realistic? Probably. More effective? Absolutely not. It only really comes into play in the finale, an action filled Hollywood shootout that drags a flawed but acceptable remake down in its last act. Pacino's latter-day madness is on full display here, much different to Skarsgård and, much as I love Al, a less compelling performance. Now Williams, however, takes his part and flies with it, bringing something new and creative to his adaptation: one of disappointingly few improvements upon the original film. An intoxicatingly interesting point to be made is that the dead dog into which Dormer shoots his decoy bullet replaces a live one shot by Engström: a fascinating difference which speaks volumes, both about the difference in characterisation and the allowances and tolerances of the respective film industries.As a remake, Insomnia is certainly poorer than its source, replacing some key plot points with less effective ones and adding an ending which is as trashy as the one it replaces is superb. Standing alone as its own work, it mostly manages to present its ideas decently and entertainingly, crafting a film better than much of the other schlock that gets churned out. If only we lived in a better world, the budget of this could have gone to distributing the original. C'est la vie, alas..."
129,"Al Pacino, Robin Williams.. They do it only for the money. They don't care if they force millions of people to spend an hour and a half watching a piece of movie not worthy of ones time.If you like bad taste movies that somehow try to make people think they are original, using shaking cameras, brownish out-of-focus and even more shaking camera... Cut-scenes of blood dropping, people getting strangled.. you know, if you like the kind of video that makes you vomit... Then watch Insomnia, watch Memento, watch Spy Games.Some scenes, for example when Al Pacino kills Robin Williams, it makes you really want to vomit, it is a scene of unbearable shaking camera and lots of very short cuts put together. Throughout this whole movie, you are shown a series of bad camera angles, zoom-in on Al Pacino's rinkels, zoom-in on the profile of Robing Williams and the whole thing is shaking, fuzzy, not sharp, full of mud and ugly.Not to mention the bad story, the bad script. It's really sad and so unbelievably badly written. (spoiler ahead) you want to know what Al Pacino's last words are before he dies? ""Don't lose your faith"", do you want to hear another quote that this movie wants you to think is cool? ""A good cop can't sleep because a piece of the puzzle is missing, and a bad cop can't sleep because his conscience won't let him"". Same quotes we can hear in about a dozen other bad Hollywood movies. Good cop, bad cop, shaking camera, damn I don't care!!Unlike what some other bad comment in here said about this movie, about David Lynch being the same kind of ""Garbage"", I off-course totally disagree.
So you can have an idea of what kind of movies I like, among some other movie-makers I like David Lynch movies, Roman Polanski movies and Martin Scorses."
130,"Well, maybe not quite a dead dog (as in this movie's most talked-about scene), but could've been better. Actually I found this version to an okay time-filler; but nothing more. The Norwegian original this was based on would have to be considered far superior. We've probably seen Al Pacino in the detective role too many times, and Robin Williams, while good, enters the plot much too late.Now onto the ""meat"" of the plot (if you'll pardon the expression): the dead dog scene. In the Norwegian original, the detective shoots a LIVE dog to fake the ballistic evidence; this is both an emotionally jarring scene and serves to further alienate the detective from the sympathy of the audience. In this version, Christopher Nolan chooses to plan it safe and have Al Pacino (conveniently) come upon a dead dog, and later return to the corpse to shoot it, then dig the slug out of it's carcass. While not packing the same wallop, this scene IS well done by Nolan and very grisly in it's own right -- we not only see the dog's death-snarl and sightless eye, but we cannot fail to recognize the gruesome fact that digging around in a rotting dog corpse has got to be pretty darn gross! I recall that in the theater, this scene provoked the most gasps from shocked theater-goers. Nolan probably figured showing the shooting of a live dog would alienate American movie patrons from his motion picture....guess Norwegian audiences are made of heartier stock!"
131,"I guess that if you cast two of Hollywood's biggest stars, both oscar winners, in the same movie and assign Robin Williams the role of the bad guy, you can get away with more than if you were to cast two unknowns. Insomnia is beautifully filmed and the soundtrack is most appropriate. The storyline, however is weak, weak, weak!! There is NO SUSPENSE, no typical moments where you jump off your seat in surprise. Nothing! Pacino is - Good, not great! Robin Williams, whom I love in both comedic and dramatic roles, is not suitable or believable in this role at all.I guess you COULD go and see it but you would be better off saving your 10 bucks and seeing it on video/Dvd/Network premier etc etc etc."
132,"The summary comes courtesy of my husband, although I'm sure other people must have made the same comment about this mogadon-fuelled thriller.I was expecting something edgier and unpredictable from the director of 'Momento', but it seems that he literally lost the plot this time. What begins as a beautifully photographed and intriguing film descends into a saggy and oddly edited disappointment which seemed to go on far longer than its 2-ish hours. This time there are no plot innovations, just annoying edits to represent Dormer's (Al Pacino) symptoms of prolonged insomnia.And, oh dear, Mr Pacino's been hanging out at the Theatre of Pain again and traded in his 'Heat' subtleties for a ""from the buttocks"" 'Scent of a Woman'-style performance. He's 62, looks ten years' older but we're supposed to believe that - not only is he still employed - he can scale fences and chase villains - albeit at a sleepwalker's pace.And please don't get me started with Robin Williams! Having obviously made the winning bid at the recent ""Roles to give gravitas to Failing Comics"" auction, Robin pulls out all the stops (which includes wearing corduroy!) to convince us that he CAN do 'serious'. The problem is he can't.In taking the role of the bushy-tailed rooky, Hilary Swank has taken three steps back in her acting career, like 'Boys Don't Cry' never happened. She's a good actress and doesn't need this rubbish.Abby from 'ER' and the Alaskan landscape give winning performances but were sadly not enough to keep me awake."
133,"When will I stop going to see a Pacino movie expecting Michael Corleone? Al no longer acts...he just looks haggard and rasps...again...and again. Slow moving and predictable, I had the exact opposite of insomnia...about a 10 minute nap...but it was still on when I awoke. Hilary Swank does add a bit of naive realism to this Northern Lights Morality Play as a bright-eyed young police detective, and it was hard to not laugh at Robin Williams no matter what he does. But this one just got stupider and stupider, climaxed by a seriously stupid ending. I wished I'd taped this one in case I ever have trouble dozing off at night...."
134,"I was originally drawn to this film because of director Christopher Nolan. After viewing his Batman re-boots (Batman Begins & The Dark Knight) and enjoying them immensely, I was hopefully that Nolan's other works would provide some of the same. In the case of Insomnia, he makes a much more ""traditional"" film, shrouded in a bit of false advertising to make it seem a bit more mysterious than it really is.For a basic plot summary, the film centers on policeman Will Dormer (Al Pacino), who travels to an Alaskan town to try and solve a murder case. With an Internal Affairs investigation breathing down his neck back home, Dormer is under intense pressure to succeed in this new arena. While teaming with local cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), Dormer not only struggles to solve the case, but also gets mixed up with mysterious writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams).On the whole, this movie functions pretty well as a traditional cop drama. It has the murder mystery, the gun shootouts, and the intrigue plot line which questions the integrity of pretty much everyone involved. Without looking for anything more, this would be a very solid film.However, the film is advertised/promoted as so much more than just a cop drama. The title itself indicates that the condition of insomnia will play a big role in the film, but it does not (Dormer not sleeping doesn't seem to add anything to the plot). Robin Williams's role is billed as a taut, psychological thrill-ride, but he doesn't make an appearance until an hour into the movie and even after that point is severely underutilized. Also, Swank's character is introduced as a potential key part in the film, but she (like Williams) just isn't given anything interesting to do.Thus, I can only give this film an ""average"" rating due to its inability to rise above a simple cop drama."
135,"A good performance from Al Pacino, the fact that you know the murderer halfway through the movie are the only interesting features of Insomnia.However there are unanswered questions, and unconnected dots that undermine the whole story.1. The murderer was always one step ahead of Will, but he know about his issue with the internal affairs from the very first phone call! How can you be a writer in a cabin in Alaska and know about such confidential issues in LAPD?2. How did they end up sending armed forces for a suspect to a cabin, while they didn't have any information on the suspect. Or even worse, where did that information come from? How did they know they should go to that cabin? (the scene where Hap died)3. Making the point of ""does the end justify the means?"" is a total cliche.4. No emotional bonds with any character, no effort in building a bit of a background for any character. I couldn't care less about seeing the two main characters die at the end."
136,"A brief review, not even, as I do not want to compete with the wonderful other ""Users Comments"" both positive and negative. They  have all been marvelous. The acting was superb, how can it not be with those magnificent actors? However, the make up artists also deserve a special plaudit for their job on Pacino's insomnia looking countenance. (Or is he just starting to look his age?) So very many movie buffs have been non-plussed by the film and agreed that it was convoluted and disappointing. Why then in ""Rotten Tomatoes"" did it get about 109 reviews from the pros????----104 being fresh, and about 6 being smashed. Who's right, the audience or the critics---Again are we dealing with ""The Emperors New Clothes"" syndrome."
137,"A pair of LA police detectives arrives in drop-dead gorgeous wilderness Alaska to aid in the case of a young girl bludgeoned to death. This movie is overpowered by the cat and mouse game between two titan actors. They rant and rave and emote all over the place, Robin Williams in the emoting category. Other than that it's a good crime story, but that's it. Just sayin."
138,"L.A. police detective Al Pacino, a legend in his own time, is called to a town in Alaska to help solve the murder of a teenager. Fine cast, a promising director, but routine results--all chopped up in nerve-wracking fashion by the editor to make this as ""edgy"" as possible. It actually goes nowhere--slowly--for the first 30 minutes, but there are some twists later on and guilty-conscious stuff which ultimately gives the proceedings some subtext. Still, it's awfully formulaic by now, evoking all the serial killer movies from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" on down. In fact, Sean Penn's similar ""The Pledge"" was a far more gripping murder yarn/personal odyssey than this one. Al Pacino acts (and looks) convincingly beaten down, and he's intriguing as always; Robin Williams is in tight, low-key form; Hillary Swank is adorable (if limited). **1/2 from ****"
139,"A tolerable movie. Al Pacino, who lost the plot sometime shortly after SERPICO, is no more than adequate as a cop who has never heard of sleeping pills, thereby compelling him to go five nights without sleep. Robin Williams, who is always and forever Mork whichever role he plays, does his impersonation of deadpan. Considering that Williams' reputation derives from being hyper, this is something of a joke, albeit in poor taste. Hilary Swank looks very nice, and acts well. The plot is routine -- troubled cop versus loony, manipulative killer. The scenery looks pretty. The direction is fidgety, sometimes annoyingly so, and over-edited. From what I have read here, Mr Nolan is one of today's better directors. Ye gods."
140,"Al Pacino is one of the greatest character actors in the past 40 years, and while not every one of his films have been met with the same level of success, he still tries to give it his all regardless. His performance in 'Insomnia' is a good example of this.The film finds him as an LAPD detective who is nearing retirement and is called up to investigate a murder of a teen in a small Alaska town where there is 24 hours of sunlight for months at a time. The premise itself is really intriguing, and with an all-star supporting cast of Hilary Swank and Robin Williams, it's hard to go wrong. That said, the execution of 'Insomnia' is a bit clunky, as the screenplay is a major letdown. The twist is pretty easy to spot from a mile away regardless of the curve balls that are thrown into the mix. Also, it's hard to take Williams seriously in a serious role, considering he always shined when dishing out one-liners in comedies.Still, there's plenty to like about 'Insomnia.' For one, the setting in the wilderness of Alaska (or, British Columbia, to be more accurate) is a nice change from the cityscapes we're used to seeing in these kinds of thrillers, and the inner battles that Pacino's character fights while in the midst of everything else adds another dynamic to things, in addition to the lack of sleep in the midnight sun that causes even more chaos.'Insomnia' is not Christopher Nolan's best directing effort, but his signature style comes through in the thriller and it's worth a watch."
141,"Insomnia is a remake of a Norwegian thriller which features the trio of Oscar winners Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank.However this is Pacino's film. He plays seasoned LA Detective Will Dormer arriving at rural Alaska somewhere north of the Arctic Circle in the height of summer when it does not get dark to solve the murder of a teenage girl. Back in LA he is under investigation by Internal Affairs and his partner, who arrives with him to Alaska (Martin Donovan) is looking like that he will buckle under pressure.While in pursuit of the possible killer in heavy fog, Dormer ends up shooting dead his partner. Was it deliberate or an accident?Dormer now has to cover up his tracks to show that the suspect shot his partner but Robin Williams who plays crime writer Walter Finch claims to have seen what Pacino did to his partner and there begins a game of cat and mouse. Finch played in a sinister but restrained manner by Williams is cold and calculating exploiting the vulnerable Dormer who is confused, tired and sleep deprived because of the lack of darkness. Finch offers Dormer a deal to frame the teenage girl's boyfriend in exchange for his silence as to what happened to his partner.Swank plays a young police investigator at first excited to be working with Dormer and then has to investigate his partner's killing.This was Christopher Nolan's first major Hollywood film and he was entrusted with three academy winning actors. Williams gives an understated performance, Swank provides warmth and steely determination but it is Pacino who is the centre as he looks to wrest control while staying up for days without sleep and sparring with Williams.However the film with its rural Alaskan vibe does not really fire on all cylinders. I expected Nolan to gives us a film that is slightly offbeat and maybe a touch surreal.Swank looks wasted, its a role any competent actress can perform. It actually lacks chills and thrills."
142,"Filling my final Nolan hole. This is another early one, I guess his first outing with some big names. We have homicide detective Al Pacino flying into rural Alaska, greeted by enthusiastic local cop Ellie (Hilary Swank). He's like a cross between a well groomed Columbo and Sherlock Holmes. Al plays Will, his sidekick is Hap (Martin Donovan). There's a little tension between them over police politics and career interests, it's a bit flat, but takes a dramatic twist in the midst of a fog filled gun chase with the suspect of the murder they've come to solve. One that sees Hap thankfully put out of his misery and Will press the button on his own demise. Alaska is a beautiful place and it looks great on screen not too surprising when the DOP is Wally Pfister. It feels a little wasted though. Especially when the place is bathed in near perpetual daylight. Pacino does his scene chewing thing, playing the renegade tortured cop, hiding his secrets, whilst trying to do his job on zero sleep (the perpetual daylight thing). It's all a bit mundane though and I'm itching for it to take on more interesting quirk. Maybe it's the location, but I'd love a bit of Twin Peaks or Northern Exposure weirdness. That's not where this is going though. It's a standard crime thriller. Even Robin Williams as the suspect bad guy Walter doesn't help much and I love Williams when he plays a serious role. Walter's a writer, a crime writer. A guilty crime writer and essentially that's what this boils down to. A guilty crime geek and a guilty cop dancing around one another as they try to help one another, but never at the expense of themselves. Psychologically it has its interesting moments, but aside Will's enforced Insomnia, there's not much to lift this. Even with Pacino, Williams and Swank, I'm thankful when this comes to a close. It nearly sent me to sleep."
143,"My confidence in using IMDb ratings to guide my rental selections is a little shaken after this one. 7.3? 7.3??! I thought this movie was a total snooze fest, which is a bit ironic considering ...Yes, it has entertainment value, but definitely not >7 worth. The performances are all fine, but the plot just isn't that captivating. I'm not sure what Hillary Swank and Robin Williams, two actors I usually enjoy, saw in their respectively roles that enticed them to do the movie. I realize that the movie is supposed to be more about Pacino's character's inner struggles than solving the central crime, but for a police drama, I still need an interesting crime, an interesting investigation, a few interesting twists and turns, etc., to hold my attention; and this movie lost its grip on me long before the close."
144,"Christopher Nolan is very smart, he uses pretty good ideas and makes his movies very entertaining. But, the plots in his movies never made sense to me. I liked his movies like Batman Begins, Inception, The Dark Knight because they were entertaining, but the plots are all ridiculous. The problem with this movie is that it is not even entertaining. The motives and actions of the characters make no sense at all. AlPacino has lost his touch and has become very irritating and the whole movie is totally boring. The plot seemed a little Hitchhockian to me which is outdated now, but the climax made it even worse. This movie was a wastage of my time, so is this review."
145,"I will say it time and time again, Christopher Nolan ruins every movie he touches. He should stick to gardening or knitting, something that doesn't involve the art of cinematography.What kind of an ending was that? Both killers die. Not that any of them were particularly likeable to begin with but that is just the easy way out, isn't it?I suppose that's supposed to signify that justice was served in the end, and everyone gets what they deserve?Robin Williams and Al Pacino are both brilliant and convincing actors, although Robin Williams stole the show. He just has that presence. They both still could not save what is a pretty average plot.This is neither the best nor worst movie I have seen, it's quite an unsophisticated and mediocre narrative with outstanding actors and a stunning scenery in my opinion. I wouldn't watch it again nor recommend it to anyone but I didn't suffer while watching the movie either."
146,"I was expecting a little more out of this movie than what i got.  I expected a smart thriller which would keep me intrigued.  The protagonist (Al Pacino character) is a walking cliche', you really don't feel him the way you would feel a great Pacino character.  Pacino doesn't deliver in making us feel this guy.The Robin Williams character is very well played as the adversary, he does a great job in making the audience understand the nature of this sordid fellow.The supporting Cast puts in an unmomentous performance.  The Swank character should have been better handled, and her relationship with Pacino could have been better exploited, i didn't get much from the exchanges between this Oscar caliber duo.  Her metamorphosis from the ingenue detective left something to be desired, i really wanted to see more emotion and get a better grasp of this character and how it evolves from start to finish than what the film gave.Finally throughout the whole movie, the concentrated effort is on how the Pacino character will find a way out of the situation, and you expect that there will be some sort of clever way that the resolution is achieved, this is where the film really cheated us.  Instead it ended with a predictable overture and nothing to really think about as you get up to leave the theater except to ponder whether or not this really was the same directorial effort that produced 'Memento'. Ranks 5 out of 10."
147,"My wife and I saw the movie opening weekend.  We agreed that ""Insomnia"" is not the best work of either Pacino nor Williams.  We found the plot to be transparent, and some plot elements, e.g., Pacino's reaction to and subsequent behavior to the shooting in the fog, to be unreasonable.  To us, the story dragged and we were both muttering, ""Hurry Up!""One can easily name a dozen films featuring Pacino that are worth owning, and several featuring Williams that are treasured library pieces. Unfortunately, ""Insomnia"" won't be joining them in our library.Perhaps, the fault is ours, rather than that of the film.  How can anyone compare Mr. Williams performance in ""Good Will Hunting"" or ""Dead Poets Society,"" just to name two, with this film?  Were our expectations too high?We don't really blame the actors as much as the material they were working with.  Had we not seen the trailer dozens of times, we might have had different expectations, and consequently, given the film a sightly higher rating of 7/10.  As it stands, we agree that it only merits a 5/10."
148,"This was a decent thriller, but overall the setup was painstakingly slow. Williams was credited 2nd, well where was he for the 1st hour?  Don't get me wrong christopher nolans memento was brilliant, but this was a tired slow film."
149,"Bomb. I loved most of the cast but holy wow, what a disappointment after a movie like Momento. Hands down the worst Nolan film, and one of the worst Robin Williams movies, and that is counting the real stinkers like RV and The Final Cut."
150,"You won't lose any sleep over ""Insomnia,"" the melancholic Al Pacino & Robin Williams psychological murder-mystery. Acclaimed director Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" (2000), has remade an outstanding 1977 Norwegian thriller, but turned it into a ponderous, profane (39 f-words), predictable, police procedural potboiler. Although Pacino and Williams usually deliver flawless performances, they act as if were suffering from insomnia rather than their characters. Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank of ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999) lurks on the periphery of this lugubrious cat & mouse melodrama like a naïve Nancy Drew, while Maura Tierney of ""Instinct"" fares no better in a lackluster supporting role as an innkeeper who sleeps with Pacino so ""Insomnia"" will have an obligatory one-night stand. Despite its mediocre, convoluted plot, ""Insomnia"" generates only a modicum of excitement during a couple of nail-biting interludes, but neither salvages this muddled morality play about redemption.Los Angeles Police Department Detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino of ""Any Given Sunday"") and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan, who played an FBI Agent in ""Malcolm X"") fly up to Nightmute, Alaska, to help local authorities solve the homicide of 17-year-old Kay Connell (Crystal Lowe) with her boyfriend, Randy Stetz (Jonathan Jackson) as the chief suspect. Actually, the real reason Dormer and Eckhart get packed off to the frozen north is to get out of Los Angeles while Internal Affairs reviews allegations of police corruption involving them. Dormer is a highly decorated, career cop accused of planting evidence to obtain convictions, and his younger partner Eckhart reveals that he has cut a deal with Internal Affairs. Immediately, Dormer fears Eckhart's testimony may reverse many of Dormer's cases and incriminate him. Meanwhile, rookie Alaskan cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) admires Dormer as a model cop and eagerly looks forward to working with him.No sooner has Dormer arrived that he has difficulty getting to sleep. An implacable sun shines twenty-four hours-a-day, seven days-a-week, and Dormer cannot catch enough shut-eye. In L.A., Internal Affairs suspects that Dormer killed. Nightmute Police Chief Charles Nyback (Paul Dooley of ""Runaway Bride"") assigns Ellie to investigate the shooting, while Dormer grilles the dead girls' classmates. Nevertheless, the accidental killing flushes out the real killer. He knows Dormer shot Eckhart, and he threatens to blackmail Dormer if the celebrated detective doesn't help him frame the dead girl's unsavory boyfriend. As for the murder investigation, Dormer observes that the killer went to a great deal of trouble to clean up the dead girl's corpse so as to eliminate any traces of DNA.For example, Dormer points out that the girl's fingernails have been trimmed. (If you're keeping track, Italian director Dario Argento used a similar ploy in his considerably more exciting 2001 whodunit ""Sleepless."" Anyway, the predictable plot thickens with Dormer and the police stake out an isolated cabin where the cops found the victim's back-pack. When a suspect shows up to take the bait, one of the clumsy Nightmute cops alerts him by keying his megaphone. During an erratic chase through blinding fog, Dormer guns down his partner accidentally, but he claims that the suspect did it. Dormer agrees to schedule a meeting with him on a river ferry.Director Christopher Nolan and freshman scenarist Hillary Seitz wait about an hour before they introduce mystery novelist Walter Finch (Robin Williams in the most muted performance of his career) as a suspect. Finch knew the dead girl, Kay Connell, well, because she visited him regularly and they have many conversations about literature. Meanwhile, Noland spends most of ""Insomnia"" dealing with Dormer's guilty conscience. Either Nightmute, Alaska, boasts no pharmacies or Dormer is too macho to gobble sleeping pills. Probably the best scene in this dreary detective yarn occurs when Dormer chases the suspect across a log flume. The elusive suspect leaps from one fast-flowing log to the next with nimble agility, but Dormer lacks his balance and timing. Dormer loses his footing, narrowly escapes getting his head crushed by the logs when he falls between them and winds up trapped underwater, struggling to hold his breath until a gap appears in the logs.. Sadly, nothing else proves as invigorating as this scene. Incredibly, before long even the sleepless Dormer begins to suspect that he has deliberately bumped off his partner. Long before ""Insomnia"" wears off, you'll know that you make a mistake if you wind up watching this wretched whodunit, too."
151,"Nothing thrilling, it is more like a procedural with some twists. The procedural wasn't tense and the twists therefore just happened along the way.To me there is a nonchalant way of telling this story, embodied by the ever nonchalant Pacino. The Internal Affairs back-story may have looked brilliant at the time, but it totally dilutes the case and actual setting. Choosing permanent daylight season may have looked brilliant too but it loses the edginess of a tired cop too used to open his eyes in the dark.In the end nothing really caught my eye - I would even say I found the overall editing of the story choppy - and most of all the Insomnia gimmick didn't work and fast became annoying."
152,"After the intruiging 'Following' and the aclaimed 'Memento' I was expecting nothing but the best from this third offering by Nolan. But man was I dissapointed. The two storylines are neither very interesting nor exciting, and personally I couldn't care less how the movie would end once I sat halfthrough it. The beautiful scenery, good acting and a brilliant scene with a light switched on (you *should* see the movie for that) don't really make up for it. I gave it 4/10."
153,"I refer mostly to esteemed director Christopher Nolan, actors Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank as the most notable here. To be honest I wasn't impressed with any singular aspect in terms of scripting, cinematography, directing, pacing, setting or anything intrinsic to great film-making. Even taken together, I did not find this picture particularly engrossing.Al Pacino's performance is best described as workmanlike. There is none of the showmanship or nuance displayed in Scent Of A Woman, Devil's Advocate, Heat or The Godfather. Bereft of a good script or a chance for one of his trademark speeches, Pacino relies on hangdog expressions as much as Julia Roberts relies on doe-eyed expressions in Notting Hill. From an actor of such obvious ability, this is disappointing. Robin Williams fares no better as the villain. He employs subtlety in a similar manner to his role in One Hour Photo but the effect falls flat here as his character fails to have any depth. There is no reason to hate him, there is no reason to understand him, sympathise with him or be terrified by him. Hilary Swank tries her best with the material but comes up as short as the rest. Martin Donovan is utterly forgettable, even considering the use of flashback scenes and mild hallucinations.The most disappointing aspect has to be the direction. Having seen such fine, genre-defining work from Nolan, it's very sad to see him flounder with this. I didn't necessarily expect clever trickery, complex editing or any of his other hallmarks, but with greater attention to the style and mood of the genre (in this case detective thriller with some film noir undertones) he could have made this much more engrossing. Instead we're lumbered with slow push-in shots, standard alternation between close-up and distance shots for action scenes and pedestrian back/forth shots for one-on-one dialogue. The entire direction fails to create a sense of mood or tension. Even the relative beauty of Alaska is not exploited, or even used except in one short scene where Pacino loses control of his vehicle.There is no sense of progression here. A complete absence of short shocks or built-up set-pieces further desecrates the picture - well, more accurately they are THERE but they're completely ineffectual and usually feel forced. You feel them coming because you've seen them done better in countless other pictures. Al Pacino does not seem any more of an insomniac at the end than he does at the beginning - it's not the make-up, it's the lack of performance. Robin Williams comes in too late and as mentioned, adds no drama or tension.The whole thing plods along without ever taking off. I was waiting for a defining moment, a spark, some kind of twist that would offset some of the obvious weaknesses but it never came. There was never a moment or a line that explained the predicament and gave the film the deeper portent it was aiming for. The plot unravels in ones mind only moments after the credits roll with notable holes and lack of substance.Perhaps I've been spoilt by such great film-making I've become jaded, but considering past performances by the creators I wasn't expecting to be left in such a malady. I am reminded of the recently released 88 Minutes which I happened to see before this picture. Sadly, although that picture is also far from top quality, I happened to find it somewhat more effective."
154,"This movie is essentially about 'cover up'. Two people and two deaths, linked together. One is a cop, another is a killer. Together, in secret, they work together. Until. Killer decides to punch another cop and take their weapon. What the heck? The entire movie is about 'getting away with murder(s)' and now you have gone and punched a cop that is questioning you...WHY why WhY? You may love everything else about this movie, however, the change of pace towards the end made no sense. The movie was slow at times, too! Great acting and cinematography."
155,"I like Al Pacino,I like Robin Williams,I do not like this movie.Are there not pharmacies,hardware stores,or department stores in Alaska.This movie is slow,un-motivated,and desperately lacking entertainment value.Al(mostly) & Robin manage to keep my opinion of this ""flick"" above a 2 or 3 star rating.Before seeing this movie I advise you to take a stimulate of some kind to keep you awake."
156,"I'm out of order. This film was out of order. I was looking so forward to seeing a great film, but i saw this instead. Al Pacino could have said ""hoo hah"" the whole 110 minutes of the film, and still come closer to being a decent movie. Maybe the reason he had a hard time sleeping was that he felt guilty for making this movie? He should have refused this offer."
157,"You Have Got To Be Kidding! How could so many intelligent movie lovers be sucked into rating this film so highly. The IMDb staff should be ashamed for falling for the ""star-power"" and credentials involved in this disaster.At best, Insomnia is predictable, uninteresting, emotionally flat (except for Pacino's performance - which seemed totally out of place among such boring bland and uninteresting performances). Robin Williams is not the slightest bit convincing as a psychotic author/murderer. Swank's character was every bit as flat and lifeless as the rest. Predictable, boring, and thoroughly forgettable. There was surprisingly little emotion (anger, betrayal, bitterness, sorrow, depression, whatever) conveyed as she witnessed the fall of her hero. The plot is given away so soon that the only tension created in the film is Pacino's insomnia - which makes this film as interesting, gripping, and engaging as actually having insomnia.This is definitely not a ""Thriller"". There was no suspense throughout the whole movie. I saw it twice and waited for it - the music told me it was supposed to be there but film I saw was anticlimactic.I have to give some credit to whoever tried to save this story by throwing in the ""good cop makes a mistake""/cover-up type subplot. It was almost interesting enough to watch Pacino's character wrestle with the white nights and a crippling conscience. But then those other cardboard characters would interrupt and turn the plot focus to into vanilla ice-cream on white bread.Now, don't get me wrong, I love Robin Williams and Hillary Swank. They are extremely talented and I would probably make a point to see any movie they are in. Memento is a landmark film in independent cinema - I loved it! They all deserve the awards they received for those specific films. BUT, the ugly fact is that, despite the talent and ""star-power"", they made a bad movie together. For what ever reasons they didn't deliver performances worthy of their best work. It happens to the best. My problem is with the reviewers, critics, and educated movie buffs who ate this vanilla ice-cream on white bread and called it gourmet cuisine - just because of the names in the credits and the hardware on their mantles. Shame on you all."
158,"**SPOILERS**Pluses for good performances by Pacino and Williams combined with the magnificent nature of Canada (Alaska in the film). What makes this a major stinker is that it is a majorly softened version of the Norwegian original, to meet the commercial demands in the States. Skarsgård's unpleasant personality was the core of the original's success. Some examples of the changes include: the dog Pacino shoots is already dead; Pacino does not feel up high-school girl; Pacino does not have aggressive foreplay; and the ending is awfully moralizing. Complete miss by the overrated copycat Nolan (Memento was not the first of its kind). Rating - 3/10"
159,"Very dull movie. Starting is good but middle long portion only feels boring. Climax is in hurry and predictable. Attitudes of Al Pacino is shown in initial interrogation is not continued further. Moreover his partner is killed by him mistakenly is been a big issue in the story, whereas AP did not kill him intentionally. This big issue makes movie lack its grip of suspense or mystery of murder. In other word to feeling guilty for parterre's killing is dominating whole story otherwise it could be a good suspense thriller. Acting by Al Pacino is just okay. Hillary Swank has a spark. However movie is not recommended."
160,"With all due respect to Al, Hilary and Robin, what happened?  How did it happen that three Oscar-winning actors put together such a ho-hum film? There was no suspense to speak of, and I neither liked nor disliked any of the characters.  Was indifference what they were going for?  The only emotion this movie wrung out of me was an overwhelming, ""Is anyone ACTUALLY this stupid?"" when it came to Pacino's character.  Please."
161,"The original version of the film, made in Norway, was far better than this version. The original was easy for Norway to do, Much of the country is north of the Arctic circle with larger towns there (It was filmed in Tromsø, the worlds most populated town north of the Arctic Circle) but for an American film, the only place in the US to do a film would be Alaska where the areas north of the Arctic circle are sparsely populated.The choice of actors was also poor. Honestly, can we see Robin Williams, a comic actor playing the role of a killer? Not me. The American version was too ""Hollywoodized"". Al Pacino tries to make it look good, but I strongly recommend the original. I was lucky enough to have first seen the original almost 2 years ago. I have seen it several times since. Comparing it to the new one. I think they tried to copy the original too meticulously.
*BEGIN SPOILER*Some scenes in both versions were virtually identical. Dormer/Engström taping the window shades down in a futile attempt to stop the midnight sunlight from keeping him awake. Dormer/Engström vomiting in guilt in an alley after accidently killing his partner, the killer escaping through a tunnel underneath the shed.Some scenes were slightly changed to seem more action oriented and less suspenseful. In the scene by the shed, the original had the killer alerted to the presence of the police by the sound a thermos breaking. In the new version, we see a thermos but the killer is alerted due to a policeman's megaphone accidently being turned on.*END SPOILER*I give the effort a plus, but the end result is a poor remake of an excellent Norwegian film."
162,"A solid follow up to the excellent ""Memento"" from Nolan. An absorbing thriller, with a beautiful setting. You know where you're going, but there are enough sub-plots to pad out this tale.Good performances from the dependable Pacino, Swank and Donovan. Williams has been praised for a return to form. However I think he's beyond redemption, and was the weakest link in an otherwise good film.."
163,Expected a really good movie with such a good cast plus the positive reviews but disappointing. Had some clever moments and good acting as expected.
164,"I cant wait for the DVD of this movie.  When I find that I cannot stand a movie that others RAVE about, watching the DVD and listening to the commentary sometimes helps.  This one needs it.Having not seen the original version, I may have had undue expectations.  I expected a film featuring Al Pacino as a weary cop being stretched beyond his mental and physical limits by Robin Williams' cunning, manipulative and murderous villain, whose psychological game forces Pacino to pursue his quarry without the benefit of rest.OOPS. My bad. The film proves to be far more simple than that.The Alaskan backdrop is the most compelling and stunning aspect of this film, and is truly great cinematography.  Unfortunately, it does not carry a film who's pacing never builds and never peaks.  With no opening hook, no mystery to solve and no tension of any kind, Insomnia plods along, staggering through a dull haze reminiscent of genuine lack-of-sleep.While Pacino, Williams and Hillary Swank work with the material they are provided, none of the characters are given enough to pull you in.  Oh if they had more to work with... Pacino's descent could have been fascinating, Williams could have been truly chilling, and Swank could have been, well... probably the same.In the end, Insomnia should be taken with a glass of water, 30 minutes before bedtime. Don't drive and don't operate any heavy machinery.See you in the morning."
165,"When a writer fails to adequately research their story they come up with improbabilities and factual errors that distract from the movie.
Since when does the State of Alaska import detectives from Los Angeles?How do Los Angles detectives maintain law officer authority in another state such that they carry firearms, make arrests and pursue suspects?Having lived in the Arctic I can testify that newcomers where eyeshades at night while sleeping. This is common.The Walther PP carried as a ""back up"" weapon by Al Pacino's character is caliber .380 Automatic and not 9 millimeter.I could not get past these goofs and Al Pacino's constant mumbling (my hearing is fine, thank you).Sure was filmed beautifully and the locations were spectacular."
166,"You would think that 3 Academy Award winners would boost the quality of this movie.  Think again.The pace of the movie was plodding, almost as if you were sleepwalking through it.  Now, it may have been totally on purpose, but I was extremely restless, waiting for something (anything!) to happen.  If the movie wanted to convey the feeling of disorientation etc associated with sleep deprivation (and suffered by Al Pacino's character), by God, they managed to do it quite well.I guess I got my money's worth:  I went to a free screening so paid nothing. I would recommend you see this movie only when it shows up on cable (save your money!) and only if you were suffering from Insomnia (guaranteed cure!)."
167,"For me Robin Williams did not fit the role as a mad psycho as he has been in too many comedy films.It wasn't his acting that brought me too this decision as he is an amazing actor its the role he tried to fit into, i could see someone like Joaquin Phoenix filling the part much more convincingly. As for Hillary swank and Al Pacino I believe they fitted the part perfectly and convinced me into believing there lifestyle. I also think that the story line was a bit too weak and should have been more intense throughout the duration of the film. After intense discussion with my class mates, I still stand on giving this weak story line a 4/10. :-I"
168,"I wanted to like this movie but could not. Basically, what you see in the trailers is what you get. There is only one other twist revealed early in the show that you could see coming a mile off. The rest of the movie is simply grinding out the rest of a predictable story. I give this movie two fingers down."
169,"You know that feeling a movie gives you at the end?  This one definitely had it.  Not because it was great, but because IT WAS OVER!  Robin Williams and Al Pacino played their roles perfectly, however, the story left me wanting, wondering If and hoping there was some kind of moral.  The final twist I was waiting for never seemed to come, either.  I own Following and Memento (Nolan's other films), but just cannot say I enjoyed this movie.  This film IS the CURE for INSOMNIA."
170,"If you suffer from insomnia be sure and see this one - -it will put you to sleep. It was a real letdown for me. I had expected from all the hype to see a tense or suspense filled drama, it was neither. It started to go downhill for me from the very first. That the L.A. police Dept. would send two of their best detectives to Alaska to help with a murder case that was totally unrelated to them or L.A. is not creditable. I feel that neither the director or screenwriter knows too much about actual police work as there were other things (e.g. running red lights and sirens blaring to serve a search warrant)that didn't make sense. Puchino & Swank did as well as could be expected with the material they had to work with. Robin William's character wasn't really believable. He didn't seem sinister at all, Just kind of well I'm here"".Chalk this one up as a summertime disappointment!"
171,"Movie Reviews =============Insomnia -------- Everything about this remake reeks of an attempt to censor the original Norwegian film. While no masterpiece, the central attraction of the original film is the morally ambiguous central figure. Outwardly a sophisticated metropolitan hero detective who always get his man and who presents an image of virtue and integrity, the real person is very different. Initially we buy into the image of hero, but the more we see how he operates in private the more we begin to doubt his moral integrity. Everything he does after we are initially introduced to him seems to cast further doubt on his character, and it seems that he is sinking into a quagmire partly of his own making. In the end a fortuitous events resolve matters, the crime is solved and the hero leaves town basking in the glory of another success. All the messy details are packed up and swept away. And so it is of great surprise that the Hollywood remake, like some nasty corporate censor, erases every single act which shows the protagonists moral slide downwards. First of all our expectations are dampened in the remake by making the protagonist not a hero cop, but a cop who is being investigated by internal affairs and sent into 'exile' for various misdeeds in the past. He seems a decent guy, but then his own partner says he is going to inform on him. He admits to out and out framing a criminal in at least one case. This it seems weighs heavily on his mind. This makes him a rather tarnished police officer. We are also not really given any indication of past heroism or why other police officers would look up to him. The original introduces the protagonist as an effective investigator as he takes charge, finds new clues, makes television broadcasts and so on. This is missing in the remake. He remarks as an aside that the murderer has washed the victims's hair, but it doesn't sink in. The introduction ends when the partner is shot and killed and we begin the moral descent.First we meet a rebellious stroppy teen who wants something 'exciting'. The protagonist gives her an extended and unpleasant grope before showing her the place where the body of her friend was found. In the remake this is deleted and the protagonist plays a game of chicken with an oncoming truck instead, which is stupid, out of character as well as pointless. Next we meet a dog that is destined to receive the substitute bullet. Our protagonist has killed his partner (by accident) and the bullet will eventually identify him. During a gun battle with the villain, our protagonist by chance finds the villains gun, something he keeps to himself. Having the villain's gun in his possession he shoots something with it, digs out the bullet and replaces it with the one the coroner found. The dog acts as substitute for a human gunshot victim. In the original the shooting of the dog is quite a gruesome episode. In the remake, the dog is already dead! It is a rotting corpse.As he descends further into the moral quagmire (symbolized by his battle with the sun and inability to sleep) he just about rapes the hotel receptionist. In the remake she has sex with him (which we are left to assume was pleasant and consensual) to stop him from disturbing his neighbours.And then the protagonist is dead! Villain and protagonist kill each other. The end! The original has a 'hollywood' ending where the villain is dead/caught and everything is back to normal. But the remake removes the Hollywood ending and kills off the protagonist. The horror, the horror!The remake does have a few redeeming features. The scenery from Alaska is nice and the small town is well presented. The dash over the log filled pond is quite nice. Al Pacino as the protagonist is very good, as is Robin Williams as the villain. Al Pacino though is let to overact, when the protagonist should generally be more understated. The actress who plays the female rookie is also quite good.The action scenes also do not work in the remake, with the exception of the log chase scene. In the original the protagonist is almost killed in the chase scene. That is deleted. The cable car scene where the protagonist catches up with the villain is brilliant. No action is possible during the cable car and instead they have a 'quiet' chat. One would think that with a Hollywood budget and a Hollywood production they could have at least improved upon the original's rather limited and drab action scenes."
172,"I had been intrigued by this movie from the time it first appeared, largely because I was curious to see how well Robin Williams would handle a straight dramatic role. Simply put, he was all right, but the movie itself was rather weak and uninspired.The first thing I wondered about was the premise. A teenage girl is murdered in a place called Nightmute, Alaska, and the local police department there calls upon the LAPD for assistance, who end up sending two detectives to help out - Dormer (Al Pacino) and Eckhardt (Martin Donovan). They have no detectives in Alaska? I mean I'm sure that murder isn't especially common up there but they had no one who could help? The cities of Anchorage or Juneau wouldn't have had a detective who knew something about  murder investigations? I just thought that whole idea was problematic.Second problem was the characters themselves. Frankly speaking, there wasn't a single likeable character in the whole movie. There was no one to root for. There was killer Finch (Williams), irritating hero-worshiping local Alaska cop Ellie (Hilary Swank) - no wonder they had to go out of state - corrupt Dormer (Pacino) and his squealing partner Eckhardt (Donovan.) Is there anyone here to feel sympathy with? NO!Third problem was the storyline revolving around the title. Yes, Pacino has the right look for a guy who's gone 6 days without sleep. But so what? The movie would have worked just as well if Dormer had been well rested, but we have to have this story about how it's hard to sleep when one first goes to Alaska in the summer because the sun is always up. OK. That's exciting.Anything good about this movie? Well, the opening musical score was quite good and really drew me in (until the movie actually started anyway); it sets the tone quite well for a suspense cop thriller. Problem is there's not a lot of suspense or thrills coming up. And Williams came across well in this very out of character role for him. Unfortunately, it just isn't a very good movie.3/10"
173,"SPOILER ALERT The main problem IMO with this film is that it gives off a thorough sense of `under-achievement' in every aspect of it. There were a thousand ways little and big in which the visual and emotional core of the film could have been imbued with substance but really all that seems to have fallen by the wayside if at all considered.1. The look of most of the film is so utterly generic it's disheartening. The aspect of a sparsely populated settlement who live a season of perpetual sunlight is dealt with in a perfunctory manner that sucks away most of the uniqueness of the film. This should have been a focal point that defined the sensibility and emotional core of the film and it was just thrown off as a two-scene gimmick reference. The entire concept of `light-as-darkness' blinding and disorienting Dormer's character is never approached to an extent worth the mention. Without that really what was the point of shooting the film in Alaska - to show that Alaska's cranky teens and crazy killers were like those in any other part of the country?2. Pacino seems to have been selected for the role of the haggard Dormer simply because his entire current career seems veered towards playing haggard old men. This is not to say that he does a bad job, he gets pretty effective in some of the scenes that come immediately after the partner's killing but really at very few points does one feel the turmoil and disorientation of Dormer and there are a few bits of sleepwalk acting even for an insomniac character.3. Robin William's writer-killer character is again a stereotype that has been seen in umpteen movies made before. I really wish they had taken pains over giving his character a different edge - I remember seeing this Iranian movie `Sara' where a man is blackmailing his employer's wife to keep his job. The beauty of it was he did it in a manner that struck you more as a reasonable plead for help than an arm-twisting. An approach like that would have worked wonders in the scenes where Finch negotiates with Dormer. But we're still stuck with the generic loony-killer.4. The clean-cut rookie cop who's a fan of Dormer (Hilary Swank) seems like a throwaway character although one does not fault Swank's performance. The film would have been tighter in the absence of such extraneous parts.5. The film lacks any real sophistication relying on cheap `oooh blood' shots to appear edgy.6. The climax is a total no-brainer. I'm informed that the Norwegian original ends on a morally ambiguous note with the cop getting away with his escapade. Hollywood of course shies away from such subtleties and we're subjected to a pointless gun-battle in the aftermath of which a dying Dormer advises Swank to not `lose her way (towards truth, justice and the American way, one supposes)'"
174,The scenery was great. The idea of it never getting dark was weird. But that was about it. I think they must have sacked the make-up artist early in the proceedings as dear old Al never even started to look tired. He may have been hallucinating but where were the bags under the eyes? And the plot was so predictable I could have left after half an hour and still known what happened at the end. Robin Williams was pretty credible as a bad guy though. Can't believe this was made by the same guy as Memento. No comparison. Waste of two hours.
175,"It starts too fast, so after about 20 minutes, sometime around the poorly-placed action scene (the misty one at the cabin), you don't care anymore.  I didn't care that he couldn't sleep.  I didn't care that he was being investigated.  So I was not involved, I only ""watched"" the movie, objective, waiting for good acting.  There were a few good acting moments."
176,"This movie has a great cast and great director.  Unfortunately, the movie sucked.  Don't waste your time with this one and if you already have, check out the original by the same name that came out in the late 90's."
177,"Insomnia is a movie for those 18 and older who enjoy mystery/thriller movies. The movie is a good film for late at night when you can devote some ""alone"" time to the movie or possibly when you are eating dinner by yourself. The actors, Al Pacino and Robin Williams, are very good in this movie. The rest of the cast are okay. Once the film is over and one has had a good night's sleep, the movie is easily forgotten in the long scheme of movies. The pace of the film is a bit slow. The movie does eventually draw you into the action as well as emotionally into support of the character played by Al Pacino. This is a movie to watch with a glass of wine to savor both the beverage and the movie."
178,I loved Memento and this was just a movie filled with Oscar Winners to cover up the weak plot. Everything was revealed to us in the 1st Act leaving a very predictable and boring show down. Al Pacino once again plays himself and Robin Williams didn't scare me for a second. Hillary Swank was charming but also missed her spark. I was bored to tears!
179,"I have enjoyed the Christopher Nolan films that I have watched, but this was a disappointment. The rugged Alaskan scenery is beautiful, and made me want to visit, but, as a crime film, it was a non-starter. The cast is good, but wasted; Al Pacino in both senses of the word, hence the title. Most people going to see a film will know the big name stars who appear in it. When one of them doesn't appear at all in the first half of the film, it's pretty clear what his role in the film is. When he does appear, the obvious is only confirmed, and so there's no ""tension"" left to resolve, and no important questions left unanswered, so I, and I suspect many watchers lost, or would lose interest. It's a shame because Pacino, Hilary Swank, Maura Tierney, plus the ""half-time"" star give good, if not great, performances. Maura Tierney's abilities were wasted, IMHO, with far too little screen time.I can't really recommend this film."
180,"Thought the movie was boring and predictable.  I didn't need to see the original flick in order to tell you what was going to happen next or why particular characters were acting a certain way.  The only redeeming part of the movie was Hilary Swank who, although was ditsy at times, did a good job."
181,"Going from Memento to this one can only wonder if Christopher Nolan did in fact have anything to do with this film.  The girl I went with fell asleep several times (which brought new meaning to the film's title). I almost fell asleep twice.  The acting is very good, it's just the damn movie moves along so slow.  It's like 'Ok, we got your point, it takes her a while to drive out to the cabin'.... 'do you have to draw it out into a 10 min scene?'. Keep in mind to all you Nolan fans.  He remade this movie from a movie that came out several years ago in france.  So he took a bad egg to begin with. He still shoulda known better. Tisk tisk.  Hopefully he just caught a momentary case of McTiernan virus (McTiernan went from DieHard to Rollerball 2002) and he'll recover.Let's all send our best wishes to Nolan on a speedy recovery."
182,"The name says it all for this movie .The good thing in it was the actors but thats it. If I were them I would deny I made this film. It is a cure for insomnia though. It would put me to sleep if I had to watch it again. I don't think there has been a movie out that I can't find something good about the movie, in this one, it is just the actors in it that are good. Thats only of their past films . It was a big disappointment for me and my husband . We don't get the chance to get out and see a movie much.This one was a waste of time and money. Would I see it again ? Not if I had a choice."
183,"The only thing that I can say about this movie is the following. This is just a normal, boring, slow movie until Robin Williams enters in the scene. After that this movie becomes unwatchble. Why, at the beginning of his career, people loved this ugly and boring actor? Usual brainwash."
184,"***MILD SPOILER*** I had the chance to see the norwegian version of Insomnia a few years ago and I can't say I was impressed.  Being an insomniac myself I was intrigued to watch this film too especially when I found out that two of my favorite actors were in it (always cool Martin Donovan and Al the man Pacino).I never really understood what all the fuzz about Christopher Nolan is all about.  Following was clever but nothing to write home about and while the trick he used in Memento made the film really popular I thought the film was inferior to Gaspar Noe's ""Irreversible"".  What I think Christopher Nolan's films lack is a heart and a meaning and unfortunately Insomnia isn't an exception.The film has a lot of great actors, Pacino is good as usual and both Robin Williams and Hilary Swank play their parts well, but there's still something lacking. Martin Donovan died too soon (sorry for the spoiler) and I think Nolan focused too much on Pacino's guilts for what happened than on his insomnia.  Anyway that's my opinion, others may disagree with me, but I really wasn't impressed with this film."
185,What is it about todays editors. The music drowns out the dialog. hard to understand.
186,"Clearly the fame of Pacino has blinded most of the critics and reviewers to a kind of reverent, hushed approach to this movie so that the cliches and average performances of so many of the cast are brushed over.It was actually boring in much of it and includes one simply ludicrous scene where Pacino chases Williams over rooftops etc, finishing up with a race across floating logs. Really??Maybe this replaced the otherwise obligatory car chase.Instead of the usual conflicted cop who's been dismissed but HAS to come back to fix something only HE can do, this time we find that the Pacino character has dark misdeeds in his past which are threatened by imminent discovery by as desk-bound man called WARFIELD.I've never been taken in by Pacino and can only attribute his fame to the Hollywood public relations industry with its overactive promotions section."
187,"I expected far more. All the characters - even Al Pacinos - were ultra predictable, the story dragged from unsurprising detail to unsurprising detail. In fact, perhaps only Al Pacinos performance and some cool editing make the film even somewhat watchable. This film packs all the suspense and interest of a new painted wall as it dries. You know exactly where it's going from the opening 10 minutes. Even the ending does little to make it interesting. Christopher Nolan, you are the weakest link. In comparison to Memento this film is a major stinker. Don't go see it as a thriller, don't go see it as a character study (re-rent Seven, or rent Open Your Eyes for that), in fact, just don't go see it. I can't believe people are praising the limited qualities of this film so highly. Insomnia was a one hour TV show with extra shots of scenery padding it out to two hours. D+"
188,"Honestly, I could have fallen asleep during this movie.  The only thing that somewhat saved the movie were the performances from Williams and Pacino. The plot had promise but never really got off the ground.  For me, there was no suspense.  I was just ready for the movie to end, so, I could go home and go to bed.  (This movie is like a warm glass of milk--it puts you right to sleep)"
189,"In almost every case, the original production is far superior to the remake. Remakes are made for the worst reasons possible (usually just for more money, or as a vehicle for cast or crew).There was absolutely no reason for this film to have been made. I give it 3 points because at least most of the original script is somewhat respected, though it is badly raped in the end (in order to make it more Hollywood, more acknowledging the universe as black and white rather than subtly shaded). Don't waste your time.Show proper respect to Erik Skjoldbjærg by watching his original production (which is technically tighter, smoother, has more intimacy and remoteness, better acting, more dynamics, tensions, and of course a story in principle superior)."
190,"I just got home from this movie and really hope to warn others... Save your money! I found the film to be a complete bore; it barely moved along at a snail's pace, and the suspense was non-existent.  My date and I agreed that there is a *purpose* for Insomnia, however, as it could truly put the audience to sleep! Watching Al Pacino go day after day without sleep and nodding in and out of consciousness, we found ourselves also doing just that.  The gunshots towards the end, however, served to jerk the audience awake. I was very eager to see this movie as the trailers seemed to offer so much more.  In the end, however, I felt as if I had been in the theater for a week rather than a couple of hours.  Extremely disappointing!"
191,"I can't understand the applause for this terribly boring and under developed story. After Memento I expected a interactive, thought provoking movie, what I got was a definite disapointment. The name Al Pacino invokes memories of some of the greatest movies of all time (Godfather,Scarface,Heat,to name a few) this will not be mentioned in the same breath as those. Having 3 oscar winning actors in the film is wonderful accomplishment, but it does not make it a Oscar caliber movie. Swank's performance was uninspired and contrived, Pacino's performance almost let me catch some ZZZZ's, Williams as a murderer, ewww terribly frightening,not really. I wish people would not be mesmerized by Pacino, but the fear of criticizing a legend overwhelms most, not me, I dont blame him although it appears he sleepwalks (pun intended) through his scenes, the story is weak, dull, and woefully spotty. If you want to waste your 9$ go see it, if not spend 3$ and rent ""The Usual Suspects""."
192,"Okay, so I saw INSOMNIA last week in Austin.  Going into it, I was excited. I loved MEMENTO and wanted an encore.  What a let down.  PACINO aside, this movie was just another piece of commercial trash.  I think I was actually more taken with the Alaskan scenery than anything substantive.  SWANK may have been good in BOYS DON'T CRY, but not in this one.  I have no idea what people are talking about when they refer to her a ""great"" actress.  Lest we forget that before BOYS she was best known for her stunning performance in THE NEXT KARATE KID!  As far as WILLIAMS is concerned, I really wasn't that impressed.  I'm thinking that this role wasn't for him, or was that the role wasn't worthy of him.  I can never remember these things.  I know what you're thinking.  But what about the story?  I don't know where I've seen it before, but I know I have.  And that, my friends, is a BIG a problem. Prediction: Initially people will see the film for its star power, but, in the end, word-of-mouth will do it in at the box office. OUT, -T"
193,"I had high hopes for this movie.  Unfortunately, this movie was a dreadful experience.  Christopher Nolan, the director of Memento, does a good enough job with the material.  However, the material isn't good at all.  Same old repeated cop story throughout history, the good cop with a tainted past who had to bend the rules at some point to get a guy he knew was guilty.  If you enjoy cliche ridden characters, i guess this movie is for you.  If you're looking for originality, unfortunately, keep looking."
194,"This is a good remake but the original is a superior film.  The lead actor, Skellan Shaasgard, is as good as they come, outshining Al Pacino, and the direction is better.  Nolan is talented but he doesn't do anything here exceptional.  Hilary Seitz is wasted in a nothing role, and the screenplay here basically follows the original, although manages to busy things up a bit needlessly.  Tech credits are solid, of course."
195,"I must admit this Hollywood version of Insomnia is not as bad as an average Hollywood production, but after watching the original one by Erik Skjoældberg, it's still rubbish. I would stick to the original and watch the original Insomnia (1997) and leave this one alone. Maybe a success for Hollywood, but still an insult to the art of cinema.. :-("
196,"I'm not sure what Nolan wanted to convey, but it was a sheer waste of time"
197,"'Insomnia' could have been great. The next 'Silence of the lambs' or 'Seven'. Robin Williams' performance is what shines in this movie- Al Pacino doesn't count, his style remains the same in all his recent films. You don't see the character, you see the star Al Pacino. Of course this is not necessarily bad, as it is always a joy to watch Pacino perform.The movie is starts off in a very common and cliche way. Like another 'Silence of the lambs' clone. But then the real development begins. There is a battle between wrong and right, what is ethical and what is not. Which is something very fresh and innovative. And then comes the ending that destroys it all.I have to warn you that what follows is a spoiler, even though it might be better to know this before you watch the movie.It is common among recent thrillers that an unhappy ending closes the story. Because movies without a happy ending have the reputation of being uncompromising, artistic and even realistic, modern filmmakers feel safer to establish a pessimistic way to finish a story. The thing is that an unhappy ending, sometimes is comes off rushed and without proper justification.Take for instance 'Carlito's Way'. The ending was balanced, even though the hero struggled to escape, he had to pay for his mistakes and the ending came as a redemption. In 'Insomnia' on the other hand, the story was unfolded for us for almost two hours, to prove that there is no line between wrong and right. We worked together with the hero to realize that, but suddenly there is a u-turn in the story in a conventional morality tale way. Everything is erased there. The whole movie was a waste of time, just like in 'Road to Perdition'.And that's why this movie is worth a1/10"
198,"Academy Award Winners Williams, Pacino and Swank ...Ironic title ... it made me sleep.Weak plot, weak acting and an unbelievable waste of talent.Avoid it if you cannot bear looking at Class A actors making total fools out of themselves."
199,"This remake of the 1997 Norwegian film by the same title is something of a disappointment, not because it is worse than the original (which it is), but because Christopher Nolan, the director, is hot off of his brilliant film Memento.  As unconventional as that film was, that is how conventional his Insomnia is.  This is due mainly to the important ways in which Al Pacino's character Agent Dormer (why didn't they just call him Agent ""Sleeper,"" hmm?) has been softened up from the original character, played by Stellan Skarsgård.  If you've seen both films, you'll know which scenes I am thinking about.  Maybe these changes are due to American audiences' sentiment that their heroes be unambiguously good, without a dark side.  Or, maybe Al Pacino's ego required that the character be more heroic.  In any case, the character has lost any trace of originality, which was really the only saving grace of the original film.  Why and how this film came to be remade in such an uninspired fashion is beyond me.  It is my hope that Christopher Nolan's next film shows a bit more spark than this one."
200,I enjoyed the trailers before this movie more than the movie itself. You can feel the effect of the insomnia by how tired from boredom you will be. Great movie if you want to take a nice long nap. Not much suspense or anything in the way of a plot twist. Very predictable overdone story.
201,"Personally, this movie stunk. The continuity was screwed up. The longer Will (Pacino) went sleepless, the more sounds started to bother him, only this occurred in certain scenes, but not in others. What happened to them? Why did they only interrupt his thoughts when he was in the police station but not on the ferry? And Williams as a bad guy is just bad. I couldn't understand why Will didn't just by some sleeping pills, like Unisom or Tylenol PM. There are ways to make a person go to sleep. I know this is supposed to contribute to the ""thriller"" theme of this movie, but it was just garbled and unorganized."
202,"When this film first came out it made waves because Robin Williams was in it. Re-watching 'Insomnia' in 2022 it is clear that this movie does not stand up. Robin Williams is good in his role, but Al Pacino barely pronounces any of his words, he is supposed to descend into chaos as the insomnia takes hold, but he is wacked out from the start. If you look closely you can see that Al Pacino's wigs are not very convincing and his forehead wrinkles keep rising above the hairline.The plot is so stupid it cannot be followed. There is a murder in the remote community of Nightmute, Alaska, and for some reason they are paying to fly 2 police officers from Los Angeles(?) to help solve the crime. On top of that the two cops are currently embroiled in an Internal Affairs investigation in L. A. None of this makes any sense.So Al Pacino, a municipal detective, is investigating a murder in a state he has never been to before, and he shoots his partner on a foggy day while they are pursuing a suspect. He does an elaborate cover-up when he could have easily claimed it was foggy and it was an accident. Also, the police force in Nightmute is surprisingly big for a town of 800 people.Christopher Nolan really missed the mark on this one. I loved The Following, Prestige and Memento are great as well but Insomnia is a pile of garbage. It feels like 1/3 of this movie was Al Pacino talking on the phone with different people that we don't ever meet.There was a time when this sort of film could inspire the imagination of the audience, but watching it in 2022 was a challenge. The editing is nauseating; so many cuts that I can't even tell what's happening. The fight scene between Al Pacino and Robin Williams is pretty pathetic, just lots of quick cuts, fast camera movements and groaning.I almost didn't finish watching this movie because it was so stupid but I stayed until the end to see Robin William's performance. Hillary Swank did a great role as well but they gave her too small of a part."
203,"... for I slept so well during this snooze fest.Let's retitle this remake, it's a remake right? And so I propose ""How to build entire career on one facial expression"". Lifetime achievement award goes to Pacino, who is such crap - can't barely use this noun next to his name - actor, I can't quite grasp how was he able to be cast in anything but cheap bank loans commercial. With that surprised look on the front of his cranium he is probably wondering himself.Above all this hangs the nasty, thick, wet and close stench of interminable boredom, suspended in the glorious atmosphere of nothingness, for nothing happens for two hours and the resolution brings no closure to anything really.Swank doesn't bring it either, Williams' acting is undeserving. Do your laundry instead, you're welcome."
204,"Al Pacino has become an overacting machine. For starters, as an L.A. cop in a heap of internal-affairs trouble, he puts on a Cajun accent more appropriate for a Paul Prud'homme biopic than a Hitchcockian policier. Why? Because it relieved the boredom, I guess; as does Pacino's insanely cliched habit of breaking up scenes by chewing gum. For one who should have learned something opposite DeNiro's elegant minimalism in Michael Mann's HEAT, Pacino has instead gone the opposite route. One feels as if an Actors' Studio Lifetime Achievement Show is playing inside his head 24 hours a day. Constantly aware of his Great Pacinoness, the man croons and whispers his lines as if every moment, no matter how routine, were an opportunity to thrum a big, fat bass and wiggle his fanny to the beat. He singlehandedly destroys this movie.The director, Christopher Nolan, is a little overfond of brain-grinding sudden-switchup mysteries--genre exercises that are the cerebral equivalent of tongue-twisters. But he brings a quiet mastery of form to this picture, and some of his key notes--a chase across some waterbound logs, for example, or the final shootout--have the staccato grace of a set piece by Walter Hill at his peak. There is also an avid, eager performance by Hilary Swank as the Nancy Drew who is Pacino's junior sidekick in solving a murder in remotest Alaska; she tears into the dopy part with a sensual avidity that's admirable, even if it doesn't help the movie much. As a murderous mastermind, Robin Williams is perhaps more egregiously miscast than any actor since Lyle Lovett played the sadistic baker in SHORT CUTS; it's as if Mister Rogers stepped into Hannibal Lecter's facemask. The whole thing would be a compelling enough programmer if not for Pacino. His last good performance was in THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, where his goofy over-the-topness fit in just fine. Someone, please, team him with Adam Sandler, where his gifts will be put to good use."
205,"Wow. Superb direction; outstanding performances by literally everyone; an unsettling story that is riveting and yet actually painful to watch. Insomnia is not a pretty film, and what it has to say about human nature is not heartening.  The film's 'beat' is always right on, though, and the cinematography is astounding.  You are teased and brought along very slowly, yet the film's pacing seems, at times, to be almost frenetic.  I must admit this is not a film to watch 'over and over again,' because it is simply too intense, at times, to bear. But this is the kind of film that will stay with you and fill your mind's eye with its pictures for days and weeks to come. The plot is actually quite simple; a detective comes to Alaska to help a friend on the force there solve a local murder. We slowly find out there is a pall of suspicion over the man and his partner. The detective masterfully outwits the killer and almost traps him; but thanks to a mistake by another cop, the killer is alerted --- in the ensuing chase, the detective 'accidentally' shoots his partner; and the killer witnesses it and begins to blackmail the detective. The light of a 24 hour day wears the detective down, and we watch him physically and emotionally unravel. Robin Williams was superb, and this was the best acting by Al Pacino in years.  Released (as it was) in the middle of a series of blockbusters, I doubt it will make huge box office.  But I hope people find time for it; it deserves a big audience."
206,"I walked out of this movie feeling like I was born again with new skin. As it looks now, this may be the only movie actually worth going to this summer. Al Pacino is a true American patriot in this movie. Robin Williams plays an excellent bad guy - kinda like the garbage man who always used to spend more time at your garbage than anyone elses, and you thought he was looking through your wife's underwear or something. This movie is set in the most beautiful and patriotic of states, Alaska, and Hilary Swank contributes to this movie's higher-than-average babe factor. If you liked this movie, like I did, chances are you: 1. Love natural-skin hotdogs,  2. Know the words to taps,  3. Have served your country gallantly,  4. Are a god-fearing patriotic  American citizen. I give this film a 9 out of 10."
207,"Al Pacino has one face in this movie, and it ain't a good one. He looks as if someone hit him over the head with a board, and he was struck dum. Robin Williams was not creepy, even when he was doing creepy things, and Hillary Swank was able to find clues as if she was reading from a script, PAT!The first half of the movie was confusing, and then they had to spell it out in the second half. The relationship between Pacino and Williams was totally and completly unbelievable, and the movie ran like molassas most of the time."
208,"It wasn't as good as I thought it would be but it was interesting to see Robin Williams as a bad guy.  It was kind of weird and confusing at times I thought but if you pay attention it's not that hard to understand.  It was good, just not totally what I expected."
209,"It's fun to watch Al Pacino and Robin Williams working together in this noirish police procedural with a twist, especially fun to see Robin Williams, as a sicko loner, still holding the screen just as well without his usual manic good cheer. Williams' performance is eerie because it's low-keyed and free of mannerisms. If you're a big Pacino fan, which I guess I am, you won't mind seeing so very, very much of those big soulful eyes in that droopy sallow face, and hearing the soft, damaged-sounding Pacino voice droning on in his performance as Will Dormer, an L.A. robbery/homicide detective working in exile in Alaska while Internal Affairs investigates him back home and his partner threatens to cut a deal with I.A. to save his own skin.  Even muttering on the edge of sleep, Pacino always gives his lines an interesting, intelligent reading.  This is a bigger, darker, more complicated, no doubt much more expensive version of the original Norwegian `Insomnia' of five years ago which starred Stellan Skarsgård. It must cost a lot to hire two Oscar winners like Williams and Pacino in the same movie. There's an excellent supporting cast including another Oscar winner, Hillary Swank, who has a whole lot less to do playing a diligent young rookie detective than she did in her extraordinary performance as Brandon Teena in `Boys Don't Cry,' and who sinks to the role pretty well, but offers her admirers little to chew on. Nicky Katt adds some alertness as a young cop, and Paul Dooley adds some mellowness as an old one. Christopher Nolan has done an interesting job in this adaptation and hasn't `sold out' by having a big budget. He may be getting better; he's certainly no worse. `Memento' seemed thrillingly provocative at the time, and Guy Pierce's lean edginess was perfect, but on re-viewing that movie's gimmick wears thin. The hero who can't make new memories is a freak, and we can't identify with him.Nolan's moody, dark ambiance in `Insomnia' continually draws you in, but causes some confusion.  One of the story's basic points is that we're in a place where the sun shines 22 hours a day and that makes the troubled detective's insomnia total.  The imagery in the original Norwegian `Insomnia' was, logically, mercilessly bright. This version is only bright when the dialogue insists on it. The scene where Will piles things up to block his hotel window doesn't make sense and the hotel keeper comes in and flips on the light to prove it. `What's wrong?' she asks.  `This room's too light,' Will says.  `No, it's dark,' she answers, and she's right.  Did the cinematographer pay attention to the original story? Every indoor shot is gloomy and mysterious.  There are never shadows on Robin Williams' face as you'd think there would be with constant sunlight.  There are, however, sudden blasts of violent, jarring sights and sounds, and Christopher Nolan hasn't entirely sworn off his sudden scary flash cuts. This is partly a psychological thriller, but the new version is more of an action movie. Nolan's blasts are louder (and so is the music of David Julyan, who worked with Nolan on `Memento' and `Following.').  I'm not sure the filmmakers got clear on what their style and mood were going to be. The Norwegian version was full of action too, but felt smaller, as it was. It wasn't as involving as this version, but it was more consistent.Pacino isn't manic the way Skarsgård was; he's terribly world-weary and always seems just about to doze off - except that he can't.  Robin Williams has been given an interesting, and far expanded, role as the hack mystery writer and creepy recluse, who tries to collaborate, in this version, with the morally compromised cop to escape detection for his own crime.  This is a very 'Forties, noirish idea and I'd like to have seen more of it and less of the police procedural shenanigans and less bother about Internal Affairs. The writers on this new `Insomnia' don't grasp that when you add new things, some of the old stuff becomes unnecessary.  In adding so much in, Nolan has successfully appealed to a broad audience and kept the story very attention-getting, but he has also made it feel more conventional. Jonathan Jackson, as the girl victim's bad boy beau Randy Stetson, is far too pretty and soigné, a fugitive from Beverly Hills, not Nightmute, Alaska.  Even Hillary Swank, a striking woman, was less pretty as a boy than Jonathan."
210,"When going into this film one might be expecting a film similar to that of ""Seven"" starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, in that the film has: 1) three Oscar winners in the cast, 2) a mysterious villain, and 3) a dark plot that every viewer wants to know how unfolds. However, the film itself falls flat in the end. The director seems to make the film focus more on Pacino's character's troubles of not being able to sleep at night, rather than on the real goal of capturing the bad guy (played by Williams). It is not often Williams takes on a darker character, but when he does, big expectations are expected. In the end, Williams has no special contributions to add to the character and all the viewer sees is another bad guy being tracked down by the good guy. The film drags on real slow (perhaps intentionally to make the viewer feel like they are in a state of insomnia themselves: not quite able to fall asleep, but not quite able to stay awake and follow the plot of the movie.) The real story line is nothing new...perhaps a little too cliche, but in the end I think the movie fails to really leave the viewer feeling satisfied that they just paid to see this film. Pacino is brilliant, just as he is in every role he plays, Robin does his best, and Hillary Swank is thrown in the mix just to have more ""stars"" in the film...but in the end the film is another one sure to zip right along to the movie rental rack."
211,"A celebrated LAPD homicide detective with a controversial past travels to a small Alaskan town to aid in the murder investigation of a teenage girl. Sleep-deprived and ridden with guilt after the investigation takes a drastic turn, he's drawn into an intricate cat-and-mouse game with the primary suspect: a sly crime novelist who's holding all the cards. What could've easily been a run-of-the-mill cop flick is instead elevated into an impressively stylish, atmospheric, and consistently gripping psychological thriller thanks to a top-notch cast, taut direction, and superb storytelling. A smart, well-crafted, and suspenseful mystery/thriller. ***"
212,"Far more interesting than the norwegian original, Insomnia confirms Nolan as the best emerging director in the american cinema.A pair of key scenes as the jumping of drifting logs are original of the new version and the character developing surpasses the somehow unidimensional roles of the norwegian one, like the officer played by Hillary Swank and the hotel clerk with a dubious past.Al Pacino's character reaches in the remake a new dimension, not only because of the relationship with his partner in the light of the investigation that takes place over his activities, but also because of the perfect construction of his drama, that makes his sleep inability work both in a literal and methaphorical level.The audacious premise of creating the noirest of films in a place that never gets dark works as effectively as the solid formal narrative of `Memento'. Nolan pushes the limits once more here and maybe the fact that Insomnia inserts itself into very defined genre territory makes it even more outstanding in its achievement."
213,"Insomnia is good until about two-thirds of the way through.  Then it gets very confusing.  People act in confusing ways, and say things you don't understand why they say them.***Spoilers ahead***The main thing that confused me was the bit about the boyfriend.  Robin Williams mentions that the kid has a gun.  Based on this, the cops ransack the kid's room and take him to jail.    All of a sudden the kid's possession of a gun makes him the main suspect.  But why?  The girl wasn't shot.  It doesn't make any sense.Also, near the end, Dormer is asked if he shot his buddy on purpose or by accident.  We know it was an accident, and he knows it, too.  But now he says ""I don't know.""  The only reason I think he'd say this is to squeeze more time out of the plot.  It could be argued that he's become delirious because of his lack of sleep.  But it's not believable, because we identify with him, and we know he's innocent.The climactic scene, which takes place at the killer's summer home, is suddenly foist upon us with no reason.  Why in the world would Hillary Swank drive all the way out there all by herself?  The movie makes a big deal about how she's the idealistic junior cop who sops up learning like a sponge (a la Jodie Foster in ""Silence"").  Does it make any sense that she would take this risk?  I guess common sense was overriden by the First Rule of Suspense Movie Endings:  The female sidekick should always get herself alone with the suspect, so she can be hurt but then saved by the REAL hero (a man), and set up a hackneyed, shoot-em-up ending.I also got completely confused by all the evidential guns and bullets that changed hands, and why they did so.  I didn't find it possible to keep track of which gun was which and which bullet was which.Anyway, it's not that bad of a movie, but I have a feeling it's another example of how Americans can take a good foreign book or movie and turn it into something trivial and cliched.  At least they didn't opt for the False Ending, where the dead psycho is not really dead; this one floated in the water, and then sunk like a rock.  Or at least that's what we think (do I hear a call for Insomnia II?)."
214,"i was a little apprehensive at first because i had been so impressed with the swedish film of the same name. there have been so many BAD remakes as of late, so i viewed this with no expectations.i got a great thriller that kept me interested and on edge till the last even though i knew the basic storyline. al pacino, as always, is top notch and martin donovan (trust, nadja) was a surprising although short lived addition to the cast. (i've seen him in hal hartley's films and really like his subtle style) hillary swank (boys don't cry) shines as the young, anxious, and clearminded local cop who helps her ""hero"" with the investigation at first, but get's put on the ajoining case and succeeds in finding truth and reality in her small town."
215,"I'm finding it hard to believe that I saw the same movie as all the other reviewers. The best thing about this movie was undoubtedly the Alaskan scenery, but even that failed to lift this film into something resembling entertainment. Plot was predictable - who'd have thought 24 hour sunlight could cause insomnia? The movie was far too long and the acting was mediocre at best. Even the ending was guessable from about a mile out.In summary, don't bother. Save your money."
216,"Once I got used to Pacino's ""on again, off again"" southern (?) accent, I realized that this could have been a good ""Law and Order"" episode. Hilariously miscast, the two aging protagonists argue their philosophical differences with their hands around each other's throat. I'm sure that most of their wheezing and panting ended up on the cutting-room floor. The dog in the alley was the most realistic character and best represented the theme of this movie."
217,"Insomnia was an okay movie, really nothing special.  It had what could have been pretty good, but a lot of the dialog fell short.   Also it was too plot driven when is so easily could have been more character driven instead.  Robin Williams and Al Pacino's performance's we good and interesting to watch, especially when interacting with each other.  How ever all the side characters we badly played with terrible dialog, even with some good actors and actresses. The only exception in this is Maura Tierney whose character was well written and acted, not matter how briefly.  I would not suggest this movie."
218,"Murder stories are not new , however original plot twists can be, [dont read any further if you have NOT watched it] the one thing it does have going for it. Yes it starts off, as the usual ""who killed the college girl in a small sleepy town"" [not sleepy enough for Mr Pacino unfortunately hence ""Insomnia""] and tends to amble along at an unhurried pace. But then due to an unfortunate twist Mr Pacino ends up killing his partner accidently [we hope]. How unlucky can someone be, only more so when it turns out his fleeing murder suspect [Robin Williams] sees the whole show. Worse still when he winds up fixing evidence, telling lies and generally not being as ""straight"" a cop as he should be. The fact his partner was about to do a deal with ""internal affairs"" regarding Mr Pacinos handling of a previous case makes ""our hero,s"" conscience even more uneasy. From then on its our murder suspect calling the shots, blackmailing our slightly tarnished hero, and the pace of the film steps up a bit as Al wrestles with his conscience, evidence, and its obvious that things are slowly going against him.Its certain Miss Swank is on to him,that theres something wrong, but of course the film is now nearing its climax [theres an inevitable shoot out] until the film all winds up very neatly, with no loose ends. Al dies, Robin Williams dies, leaving Hilary Swank [who was almost the next victim] to either bury the evidence [regarding Al,s misdeeds] or make it public, you are left with the feeling she will make it all known. All the main characters are believable, but we hear little of their lives, loves, or background, and maybe we do not need to. The cast is relatively small, so keeping track of whos who, is nice and easy for a change.Credit to the make-up dept for making Mr Pacino look like he had not slept for months, made me tired just watching him try to stay awake. One of the better ""who dunnits"" of recent times , but just not quite reaching that ""greatness"", but well worth watching."
219,"INSOMNIA Christopher Nolan shows he's a genuine talent when it comes to directing in this remake of the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name, INSOMNIA.
Veteran LAPD detective Pacino and his partner travel to a small-town Alaskan police force to investigate a teenage girl's homicide, and while trying to catch the distorted man (Williams) who killed her, Pacino is forced into a game of cat-and-mouse and tainted by a lack of sleep and guilt.
It's a crackling good police thriller, augmented with breathtaking locations, top-notch performances, build-up pacing, and layered storytelling. INSOMNIA will not put you to sleep.Running Time: 118 minutes and rated R for language, some violence, and brief nudity. GRADE: B +"
220,"A movie with no special effects, no explosives, no real action sequences - how could it succeed? Yet British director Christopher Nolan, known previously only for ""Momento"", has made a wonderfully crafted remake of a 1997 Norwegian thriller. Although slowly paced, the plot is so intelligent and the acting so fine that one is in no danger of falling asleep any more than the Los Angeles cop played consummately by Al Pacino is in the near-permanent daylight of an Alaskan summer.His quarry is a murderer who writes crime novels and likes to play mind games and it is a pleasure to see Robin Williams back in a successful 'straight' role, where the inter-play between the protagonists reminds one of the Pacino/de Niro meeting in ""Heat"". Newcomer Hilary Swank gives a promising performance as a rookie cop who admires the Pacino character more than perhaps she should.Finally, the unusual location shooting gives the film a very distinctive feel, although - while set in Alaska - most of the actual shooting was done in Canada's British Columbia."
221,"I love Christopher Nolan movies for their powerful psychological thrills and revelations. Insomnia kept my eyes glued to the screen and even made me fearful of what was to come. I cant even imagine what I would do if I was in a situation like so... It just really gets to you. You root for the characters, in some maybe twisted way. It's hard to explain, watch this movie!"
222,"This movie might have been good, if they hadnt cast Robin Williams as the killer. Robin Williams is completely unbelievable as a killer. The fact that he walks around with a silly smile on his face during the entire film makes it hard to believe him.When, he tells an excellent Al Pacino how it changed him to kill someone and later on tells him why he killed the girl I could give a rats ass. I dont for a second believe that he killed her. He just looks too much like a nice guy. And he never acts cold or seem dangerous. Not one time in the movie is he scary.This movie is way too long and the ending is very predictable. Hilary Swank is gorgeous and sexy, which is a nice change, compared to her previous roles. She also acts well. So does the girl who works at the hotel.Everybody else in the film is superficial and dont support the story in anyway. Pacinos partner Hap is a scumbag from the beginning and you dont even feel sorry for him when he dies.The town in the film is an excact copy of Twin Peaks, without the scary atmosphere, the show had.Another thing is, why didnt Pacino just kill Williams right away? That way, he would have solved his problems. And we didnt have to waste two hours of boredom, waiting for Williams whiny, pathetic killer to die.
Why everybody thinks Wiliams is so great, is just beyond me.
They should have cast Edward Norton as the killer instead. He can at least act and look scary when he needs to. He can be dangerous.Williams is just ridicoulus. He should stick to comedies and stay away from roles he clearly cant handle."
223,"Christopher Nolan, director of the mediocre and overrated ""Memento"", brings us `Insomnia'. A thriller featuring three Oscar winning actors: Al Pacino (Scent of a woman), Robin William (Good Will Hunting) and Hilary Swank (Boys don't cry).""Insomnia"" tells the story of detective Will Dorner (Al Pacino) who is sent along with his friend (Martin Donovan) to a small town in Alaska to solve the murder of a teenage girl. Although it's a murder that might be investigated by the local police forces, Dormer has problems with LA police department due to his excessive obsession to catch the criminals. His outstanding skills lead him to the Criminal; however, as soon as he captures the criminal a sequence of unexpected events leads him to make a great mistake. The criminal is the only one who finds out about his mistake and escapes without being caught. After these unexpected events the detective starts to be hunted by whom his prey was minutes earlier. His remorse because of his deadly mistake and the murderer's subsequent blackmails make Dormer a person who can't get to sleep at all. His insomnia is presented as a metaphor with the white and beautiful night of Alaska, where all is illuminated, blurred and confusing. The camera work and the soundtrack make the viewer get into the character's shoes, who loses his sense of reality because of his sleeping shortage.All the performances are good, but I've never liked Robin Williams because he's always making fun of people and the human body and I can't stand this at all. The actor who really stands out as usual is one of my favorite actors, Martin Donovan. If you want to see his best performance watch my favorite movie ""The Portrait of a Lady"", where he delivered a perfect portrayal, as Isabel Archer's sickly and admiring cousin.
Overall, the movie was not what I expected. I can't say I liked it, but I can say that the title ""Insomnia"" was original and fitting to the movie. I thought the movie would be dark and dramatic, but it wasn't. It was really simple with a terribly predictable ending. Other than the title there is nothing that should interest you in seeing this. 4/10"
224,"***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** MEMENTO was one of those great, rare treats, where if you saw it with someone who really liked it, who got it, so to speak, it led to inevitable hours of discourse as you agreed and disagreed on both the key elements in the movie and the unresolved ending. At the same time, it was one of those frustrating experiences where, when trying to recommend it to a friend who you kind of knew wasn't into this type of film, led you to enduring the painful glazing of eyes from your buddy when you attempted to pitch the film without giving the whole premise away.From director Christopher Nolan we now have INSOMNIA, and while a very different movie to MEMENTO indeed, it does share some traits, and like Nolan's other film, is outstanding and very highly recommended. Also like MEMENTO, it's difficult to heavily review the plot without giving too much away, so I'll keep it light.Jaded detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino), a generally respected and knowledgeable LAPD officer, and partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), arrive in Nightmute, Alaska, to assist in the murder of a local high school girl. The pair arrive during Nightmute's summer, which means endless daylight for months. We learn that Dormer is under major investigation from the LAPD Internal Affairs for what later transpires to be his involvement in the incarceration of a child molester who, without his actions, would have likely escaped without punishment.However, Dormer is shocked when Eckhart announces that he is going to `cut a deal' with Internal Affairs that likely will result in Dormer being prosecuted. Dormer is furious with his `partner', and lets him know it. Meanwhile, the lack of darkness at night begins to plague Dormer, and he cannot sleep. (Hence, the title of the film.)Dormer does, however, impress the Nightmute detectives with his abilities as a police officer; in particular, he draws the attention of Detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who studied Dormer at the academy. Initially, she is in awe of him, and picks up on each little tip and nuance Dormer offers.Dormer sets a trap for the killer, and soon he, Eckhart and the Nightmute team are on his trail, and they trace him down to a small outhouse. In seriously foggy conditions, Dormer mistakes Eckhart for the killer, and accidentally shoots and kills him. Before he dies, Eckhart reacts badly, accusing Dormer of killing him intentionally. As the other police officers rally around the fallen officer, Dormer, realising how this will look within the restraints of his IAD investigation, panics; rather than owning up to the accident, he announces that Eckhart was shot by the killer.From this point forward, Dormer continuously questions his involvement in Eckhart's death - was it an accident, or not?Dormer quickly tries to conceal and plant evidence to support his story, and for a moment feels that he just may get away with it. Unfortunately, the appearance of Walter Finch (Robin Williams), who reveals himself as both the killer, and a witness to Dormer's deception, throws more than one spanner into Dormer's case. Finch claims that he had no intentions of murder, that the death of the girl was a total accident. Dormer never believes him, but has little choice but to go along with Finch's scheme.In a series of increasingly psychological and confusing meetings, the unlikely partners discuss how they can both come out of this situation unscarred. As Dormer's level of involvement deepens still further, he begins to question both his sanity and his principles. Meanwhile, he continues to be unable to sleep.INSOMNIA is a project that works on many different levels, but is bound together by one exceptional performance - Pacino's. Arguably now the greatest living actor (especially when one considers the questionable film choices made by Robert De Niro over the past five years or so) Pacino is totally convincing as the sleep-deprived, jaded detective, and this is essential as he is in every scene in the movie (bar a few flashbacks). You're drawn to his character who, while flawed, is by no means a bad guy, and as the layers of his life begin to unravel around him you genuinely feel for him. And ever the method actor, you look on to watch a person increasingly drawn and withered against his battle against Williams, the IAPD and Nightmute's lack of darkness. The daylight remains a constant reminder of the menace.Williams, meanwhile, in the first of a trilogy of dark roles (ONE HOUR PHOTO and DEATH TO SMOOCHY are coming soon), while not in big Al's league, is still solid as the creepy and always-in-control Walter Finch. Never physically threatening (which is a performance in itself - have you seen William's forearms? He played POPEYE for a reason.) Finch possesses a subtle menace that steadily rises as the film progresses. From the offset he knows that he has Dormer exactly where he wants him, and as Dormer tries to wriggle out from his intellectual grip, he simply finds himself held increasingly tighter.The rest of the cast are adequate in their roles, although Swank is somewhat of a letdown through really no fault of her own - the character is just lifeless and a bit predictable.Nicky Katt (who played Fred Duggar, one of Nightmute's finest) was driving me nuts throughout the film, not because of his performance but because of who he was, or rather what I had seen him in previously. I  knew the face so well but just couldn't work out form where. Then it connected: BOILER ROOM! The absence of that knowledge kept me numb during various key parts of the film when he was onscreen but thankfully I was able to focus somewhat.Overall, this is a quality film that contains a superlative performance (Pacino) and while not as original or memorable as MEMENTO is evidence that Nolan is very much a director to keep in your phonebook. Highly recommend.Rating: 82 %"
225,"I doubt anyone seeing moody thriller `Insomnia' will fall asleep during its tortuous ride through Alaska's forbiddingly beautiful valleys and glaciers. Detective Al Pacino comes to Alaska from Los Angeles to help solve the grizzly murder of a seventeen-year old girl.  Along with him is a partner who is ready to tell Internal Affairs about matters that may put the heroic Pacino's reputation in jeopardy.Robin Williams is the alleged murderer.  Enough said.  The value of this Chris Nolan (`Memento') film is not so much in the confluence of the Alaskan murder and the L.A. I.A. investigation as it is in the meeting of these gifted Oscar winners.  When I wanted to see Pacino and De Niro in `Heat,' I remember being disappointed in the number of one shots and reaction shots which suggested the 2 actors may not have been together for some of those takes.  Not so in `Insomnia'-not only are Pacino and Williams in a series of two shots, they complement each other so well you think you are dreaming. Pacino resists his usual ranting, probably sensing that a weary insomniac couldn't; Williams underplays with a hint of crazed perversity befitting his character.Oscar winner Hilary Swank has a weakly written part as the young Alaskan detective learning from Pacino. Even her great smile can't distract us from Pacino and Williams. She does have the best analysis of the films thematic dilemma: `Good cops can't sleep because that missing piece of the puzzle keeps them awake. Bad cops can't sleep because of their conscience.' As he did in `Memento,' Nolan keeps you awake wondering about the accuracy of knowledge and the integrity of the law.But conscience makes cowards of us all, and sleep in the relentless Alaskan sun comes not to the troubled.  As Hamlet said: `To sleep? Perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub: For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause.'`Insomnia' is a dream of an acting showcase with cinematographer Wally Pfister landscapes that become another satisfying dark character. You'll not pause or sleep in this satisfying thriller."
226,"An exceptional remake of a foreign movie, Insomnia works in all departments. The acting is the best you're likely to see on the big screen.  Of special note, besides Al Pacino's always top notch performance, is Robin Williams who could very easily have overplayed his role the way Jack Nicholson tends to do in similar roles from time to time.  But he does a fine job and is very convincing.  Also Hilary Swank almost out acts both Pacino and Williams.  Even the small roles are excellent.  And Christopher Nolan continues where he left off in ""Memento"" as one of the best directors alive. Moving the setting from Norway to Alaska was a wise move, keeping the action in the United States but also keeping the midnight sun image alive as part of the insomnia motif. Wake up and go see one of the best movies of the year."
227,"Having seen Nolan's later films (Batman Trilogy, Inception) before watching Insomnia for the first time, I was thoroughly impressed. Nolan's neo-noir style becomes fully apparent in this film, incorporating many noir motifs. For example, instead of heavy rain in every outdoor scene, Nolan ironically sets it in summertime Alaska, where the sun never sets. The plot is tense, and Pacino delivers a fantastic performance, though the actor I was most impressed with was Robin Williams. I had only seen Williams play a dramatic role once before in The Final Cut, and he demonstrated his abilities as an actor beautifully. Overall, I would recommend this to anybody who enjoys the thriller genre."
228,"Of Course Alaska has spectacular scenery but that wasn't what you saw in the movie. I think the only part of the movie that was filmed in Alaska was the glacier at the very start.The Lakeside cabin scenes were primarily shot in Stewart,British Columbia, Canada. The foggy cabin scenes were shot near Indian Arm in North Vancouver,BC. The chase over the floating logs and some of the small town scenes were shot in Port Alberni,BC. Much of the rest of the outdoor scenes (and a few indoor scenes were shot in Squamish,BC."
